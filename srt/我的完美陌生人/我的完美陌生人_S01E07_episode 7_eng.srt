1
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,984

2
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,664

3
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,275

4
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:28,060

5
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,218
 Right. I may have gotten it wrong from the beginning.

6
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,638
 The three suspects in 1987.

7
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,418
 The fact that I was trying to find the answer

8
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:59,340
 from the choices that the incompetent police came up with...

9
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,500

10
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,448
 That itself was wrong.

11
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:18,028

12
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,948
Are you all right?

13
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,738
I told you I could handle it.

14
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:31,268
Well...

15
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,978
Other than these two, it's not like there's anything really new.

16
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:41,538
Even though I found out only five minutes ago. Yes, it was a surprise, but...

17
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,028
How did you even obtain a photo like this? It's my first time seeing this, too.

18
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:55,108
You must've been very thorough with your investigation.

19
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:58,458
Wow! There's no joking around with your journalism experience.

20
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,918
But there is nothing...

21
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,988
on Baek Yoo Seop.

22
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:10,278
Out of all these documents, I don't have a single one on him.

23
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:14,028
I never considered him as a suspect.

24
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,178
What kind of person was he? Your dad's older brother, Baek Yoo Seop?

25
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,748
Well...

26
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,688
I thought I knew him well.

27
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,508
Until I ran into him earlier today.

28
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:43,640
♫  Flickering as if it were invisible  ♫

29
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:51,680
♫  The road was shrouded in fog  ♫

30
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,640
♫  The road that is like a rainbow  ♫

31
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,858
He felt too distant to call him family.

32
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:05,418
He felt too close to call him a stranger.

33
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,968
But the face I was so tired of seeing

34
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:14,578
wasn't there in the slightest.

35
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,718
 Uncle, what are you doing right now?

36
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,038
 Oh, books.

37
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,478
 I told you not to come into my room without asking!

38
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,388
 Why are you doing this to me? Really!

39
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:36,598
 Give it to me! Let go!

40
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,918
 Let this go...

41
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:50,998

42
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,098
 Apologize.

43
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,248
 Say you're sorry!

44
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:02,708
 Don't raise your voice.

45
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,638
 We are family.

46
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,068
 That's your family.

47
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,068
 Mom and I weren't even included from the beginning.

48
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:17,488
 You thought I didn't know?

49
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,918
 That's why you're not family to me either, Dad.

50
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,048
 Oh, gosh.

51
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,838
 Yoon Young!

52
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,168
 Gosh...

53
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,740
I don't know.

54
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,400
If he's the person I'm thinking of...

55
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:53,168
or what kind of person he was.

56
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,648
Then we have to find out from here.

57
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,608
Oh, gosh. You scared me!

58
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,098
Come here.

59
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,298
I'll be asking you a few simple questions right now.

60
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:43,438
If your responses include any lies, we will have a parent-teacher conference tomorrow.

61
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:47,088
Excuse me? What kind of thing is that?

62
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:51,338
- But parent-teacher conferences... 
 - So answer well.

63
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,578
Who does this belong to?

64
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,488
This cap?

65
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,978
But why are you here in the middle of the night questioning me about my cap?

66
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,718
Then, shall we do this tomorrow?

67
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:14,050
Come to school with your uncle by 8:00 a.m.

68
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,090
It's my older brother's. Why?

69
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,698
I just borrowed it last night and tried it on.

70
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:28,068
Last night. What was your real reason for going to Motel Woojeong alleyway?

71
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:32,098
I told you. I was just trying to take a walk...

72
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:35,420
If you're getting confused, I'll ask more specifically.

73
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:42,720
Who made you go down that alley, even turning in the direction you were walking last night?

74
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,128
The one who was walking with you and then disappeared by himself.

75
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:53,380
The person who made you lie to me about taking a walk.

76
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:56,088
Who was it?

77
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:16,278
He just asked me to check if the light was on on the second floor.

78
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,808
Who?

79
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,948
Who asked you to do that?

80
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,898
You say it yourself. Who is it?

81
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,658
The one...

82
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,648
with my last name.

83
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,268
So it was all Baek Yoo Seop.

84
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:15,828
He was curious about where Lee Joo Young was staying on the second floor.

85
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:18,798
He did that even though Lee Joo Young did not show up at Bong Bong Cafe last night.

86
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:23,188
That means he was targeting Lee Joo Young from the beginning.

87
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:28,258
And this incident from last time. When he escaped from up here.

88
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:33,768
That also happened as he was spying on Lee Joo Young down there.

89
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:39,528
So the one with the blue cap, Baek Yoo Seop, must be the suspect because...

90
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,138
If you rush ahead like that, you might get motion sickness.

91
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,368
If Baek Yoo Seop is the culprit,

92
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:57,298
we won't need to wait. We will meet him tomorrow night.

93
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,018
Since he has to...

94
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,518
kill the second victim.

95
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,828
Are you really prepared to face that?

96
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,778
You don't need to hide and suppress how you feel.

97
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:24,938
It's natural to struggle and feel pain.

98
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:27,328
He's your family in the end.

99
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:59,888
It's too awful that I have such mixed feelings right now.

100
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,878
But that's all I feel.

101
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:07,788
The rest of it...

102
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:12,548
is all about needing to save my mom, and you,

103
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:17,158
from that horrible human being.

104
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:19,298
So that's why...

105
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:36,208
Are you going to tell the whole neighborhood about your mom and me?

106
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:58,348
I was just disturbed about Baek Yoo Seop.

107
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:01,478
No one knows him better than I do.

108
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:06,078
From now on, I will fill in your missing data and information.

109
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,048
From now on,

110
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:12,098
we don't know what we will come across.

111
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:14,298
Are you sure you can handle this?

112
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:17,978
Yes.

113
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:20,278

114
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:24,848
 No matter what anyone does,

115
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:28,668
 if it's the truth I need to find out,

116
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:37,158
 I'm not going to run away from it.

117
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,688
 That's how I will be able to protect.

118
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,760

119
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:10,358
You came?

120
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,798
Yes. I brought your change of clothes, Mom.

121
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:25,208
What should we do now?

122
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:31,020
You should know first who the second victim is.

123
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,738
Who is it?

124
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:55,698
Hello. Contestant number 2, Miss Gyeonggi.

125
00:14:55,698 --> 00:15:00,998
I'm Lee... Kyeong... Ae...

126
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:04,008
Nice to meet you.

127
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,878
No way.

128
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:21,378
You really had no idea?

129
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,138
You met an aunt you had never met before.

130
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:30,328
I was told she was weak and died at a young age of an illness.

131
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,548
Is there anything else you haven't told me yet?

132
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:43,028
I showed you upstairs, so now you know everything.

133
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:49,468
You have a plan this time, too. Right?

134
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:53,178
Do you think it's a coincidence that I found a house facing them?

135
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:56,448
Then from the beginning, you...

136
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:24,148
 Based on my observation this past month, today will be the most difficult day.

137
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:28,928
 Because the person we need to save is no ordinary person.

138
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,118
 Mock Exam]

139
00:17:58,268 --> 00:18:02,358
I found it! Dad's emergency money!

140
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:07,488
You should have thought of this earlier, Kyeong Ae!

141
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:13,408
Oh, yes! So I just need to save a little more...

142
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:17,418
Just a little more. Just a little more.

143
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:20,678
Just save a little more...

144
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:24,698
Just a little more. Just a little more.

145
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,748
Woojeong Village's mess. The craziest person in this town.

146
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:51,600
You shouldn't dare to logically understand what she's doing and why she's doing it.

147
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,240

148
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:56,698
That's why it was the house across from here.

149
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:59,098
Since we don't know where she might go.

150
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:17,398
So you're saying we can't really trust even the route found by the police at the time?

151
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:19,928
They missed too many things.

152
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:24,468
It became more apparent after last night.

153
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:35,978
In any case, they reported the last whereabouts as

154
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:39,688
9:00 p.m. tonight at Bong Bong Cafe.

155
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:42,108
The same as Lee Joo Young. Right?

156
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:47,978
She must've run into the culprit after she left that place.

157
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,518
But today is different.

158
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:58,468
Since we will be there behind her.

159
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:03,958
This time, we will get it right.

160
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:07,798
Yes, we will. Definitely.

161
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:17,018
What about school?

162
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:19,098
What?

163
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,518
Fever? 39 degrees?

164
00:20:23,518 --> 00:20:28,148
Yes, since I'm her only guardian...

165
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:35,818
Yes, of course! She should be going to the hospital, not school!

166
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,358
Yes, yes, you know the town intersection. Right?

167
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:43,770
Don't even think about your classes and take good care of her.

168
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:46,318
Yes, yes.

169
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:49,058
Gosh.

170
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:51,998
I don't think you can do it today.

171
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:55,288
I can just meet him at the hospital.

172
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,088
Oh, it's on the way.

173
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,818
How are your children, by the way?

174
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:05,388
Oh, yes. The hospital said they can leave.

175
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,168
But I'm letting them stay one more day.

176
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:09,248
Good, good.

177
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:13,168
Buy them whatever they want to eat while you're at it.

178
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:16,268
And let them see your face more often, too.

179
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:19,818
- Why are you doing this, Director Yoon... 
 - Just take it.

180
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:28,038
If I don't do this, I can't feel good about seeing my son in a few days.

181
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:34,918
I'm the one who didn't let you leave the other night.

182
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:38,738
It's not like you did it on purpose.

183
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:45,468
Oh, this tastes like cherry.

184
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,368
Is Yeon Woo returning home now?

185
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:50,688
Yes, he called.

186
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:54,638
He said he'd come to see his dad.

187
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:58,438
It's been three years now.

188
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:03,338
Be grateful when your kids act cute in front of you.

189
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:06,398
Your children won't stay by your side forever.

190
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:07,768
Yes.

191
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:12,628
Do you want to try one?

192
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:15,648
Oh, yes. Thank you.

193
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:20,118
I'm telling you.

194
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:24,838
If only I become Miss Korea, I'll buy you a nice mink coat.

195
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:28,958
Geez! This is the kind of child I have!

196
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,078
You think it's that easy to buy a mink coat?

197
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:34,918
What the heck? I'm not asking you to buy it. I'm telling you I'll buy you one!

198
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:36,638
Yeah, right.

199
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:38,678
Mom, if only I become Miss Korea...

200
00:22:38,678 --> 00:22:43,338
Don't take us for a ride. Just quit drinking, you mess. Talking about Miss Korea...

201
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:46,458
How dare you be so rude to your older sister...

202
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:50,668
Why are you all treating me this way? They told me I definitely have potential.

203
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:54,868
If you talk about 500,000 won again, you're in big trouble!

204
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:59,638
You're not meeting strange people and doing shady things, are you?

205
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:03,138
Mom, you don't know anything.

206
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:09,888
But can you help me out a little bit?

207
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,818
Are you crazy?

208
00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:15,278
Nothing! Even if I want to eat and die, I have nothing!

209
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:21,078
Could I get a math tutor, by chance?

210
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:28,528
It's becoming really hard these days.

211
00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:31,568
And the achievement exam is right around the corner.

212
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:41,458
I have some money saved up. So if you could just help with a little bit...

213
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:44,498
This girl...

214
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:47,838
You're just clueless, aren't you?

215
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:06,498
Soon Ae.

216
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:10,238
When I get some extra money, I'll be sure to help you.

217
00:24:10,238 --> 00:24:14,140
I'm late. Have a good day, my child.

218
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,230

219
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:23,148
 Oh, Mom. I have to buy a few books.

220
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:31,398
Let me know if it's not enough.

221
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:33,958
Don't say anything to your sisters.

222
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,638
I'll get going.

223
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:13,478
We can't get caught or lose her, no matter what.

224
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,940
You said she works at a hair salon. Right? Then, she must be going to work.

225
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,340
It can't be that normal. She skipped work, and there's no record of what she did during that time.

226
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:23,548
We'll find out if we follow her.

227
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:28,148
She's there.

228
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:37,648
Lee Soon Ae, you did that on purpose earlier, didn't you?

229
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:39,468
What did I do?

230
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:43,088
You think my dream is a joke.

231
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:46,348
That's why you butted in like that and talked about yourself.

232
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:53,388
You were saying, "Don't waste your money on this piece of crap and use it on smart me."

233
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:59,248
Sorry I interrupted, but I really didn't know what was going on. I wasn't listening to what you were saying.

234
00:25:59,248 --> 00:26:01,198
Weren't listening—

235
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:03,448
Now you're just straight-up ignoring me?

236
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:06,458
- No, that's not what I meant. 
 - Hey.

237
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:10,848
You think only you're the best. Right?

238
00:26:10,848 --> 00:26:14,858
Geez, that hairpin. That's actually what I asked for.

239
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:17,858
But Dad only bought it for you.

240
00:26:17,858 --> 00:26:20,748
Who cares about being the first place in the entire grade...

241
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:26,708
But even all that favoritism has limits, you know.

242
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:30,668
You think Dad's not getting you tutoring because he doesn't have any money?

243
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:32,668
What do you mean by that?

244
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:38,598
He has no intention of sending you to college.

245
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,928
How do you know that, Sis?

246
00:26:43,928 --> 00:26:46,548
Only you don't know. Only you.

247
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:49,878
Hey, do you know what Dad's wish is in the first place?

248
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:56,608
He wants to marry you and me off to a good family early on, so we can live a comfortable life.

249
00:26:56,608 --> 00:27:01,958
And make Oh Bok study so he can get a decent job.

250
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,518
Those are his only two wishes.

251
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:07,988
But you're not heading in this direction.

252
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:12,528
So? Is that how you want to live, Sis?

253
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:18,128
- What? 
 - I don't want to live the way Dad wants me to live.

254
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,838
So what if I don't get any tutoring? I can do it on my own.

255
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:27,818
So if you need help to follow your own path,

256
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:31,738
take this and use it.

257
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:37,758
I never thought your dream was a joke.

258
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:45,718
Is she telling me to read this and get smarter, or what?

259
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:48,798
She keeps looking down on me until the end...

260
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,288
Oh, geez.

261
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,408
Gosh, how annoying!

262
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:45,498
I can go by myself.

263
00:28:47,598 --> 00:28:52,888
No, Mom would want me to follow her that way at the moment.

264
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:17,798
This is the first time I'm resentful of my grandpa.

265
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,288
That was my mom's wish in life.

266
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:22,888
She never got to go to college in the end.

267
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,988
That was probably not uncommon at the time.

268
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:31,218
Just because it's common doesn't mean it's not a tragedy!

269
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:37,158
He probably wasn't aware of the consequences of preventing his daughter's path.

270
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:52,558
What is she doing?

271
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:59,618
Regardless of what she does, we just need to watch until the culprit shows up.

272
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:02,818
We can't create any more variables.

273
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:17,418
Surprise!

274
00:30:17,418 --> 00:30:20,668
Hi! How's it going, cutie?

275
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:22,978
You said you finally have it ready.

276
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:30,358
But who are they?

277
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:35,068
What do you mean? They'll be preparing for Miss Korea with you.

278
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:38,408
First of all, she will be the first runner-up in Jeonnam.

279
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:41,888
She's the winner in Daegu, and she's the second runner-up in Kyeongbuk.

280
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:44,518
But I paid 500,000 won because you said you'd make me the first runner-up.

281
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:47,138
Oh, sorry. First runner-up.

282
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,658
Well, then.

283
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:53,878
Which one will you be in Kyeonggi, cutie?

284
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:01,678
First runner-up.

285
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:08,338
First runner-up? The winner!

286
00:31:08,338 --> 00:31:12,028
Here. Come here. Get in.

287
00:31:12,028 --> 00:31:13,248
Let's go!

288
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,678

289
00:31:14,678 --> 00:31:16,948
Hurry and get in!

290
00:31:16,948 --> 00:31:19,768
What are you doing? We don't have time. Hurry up and get in.

291
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:23,498
What are they doing right now?

292
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:27,348
Was it today? The day they scammed them?

293
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:31,238
Scammed? What do you mean?

294
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:34,768
Some guys told girls they would make them Miss Korea for 500,000 won.

295
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,818
- Hurry up and come! 
 - They have been working on it since I arrived.

296
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:42,398
Even if they made money, they'd spend it all on drinking and payoffs.

297
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:45,538
They were fraudsters tough to handle.

298
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,188
Then, that money! That's my mom's money!

299
00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:53,648
Well, we can't do anything about it.

300
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:55,798
What do you mean we can't do anything about it?

301
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:58,638
With 500,000 won, she can even pay tuition!

302
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:01,398
Are you from a wealthy family? Are you an only child?

303
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:03,218
You wouldn't know since you weren't raised as a daughter.

304
00:32:03,218 --> 00:32:05,698
That's why you can say that so easily!

305
00:32:05,698 --> 00:32:08,118
W-What are you talking about...

306
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:10,848
No, let me go!

307
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,648
Gosh! What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

308
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:15,828
We have to hurry up and go to Seoul together!

309
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:18,028
No, I don't think this is going to work.

310
00:32:18,028 --> 00:32:21,388
There's a really stupid and smart girl in my family, and

311
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:23,778
I keep thinking about her.

312
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,098
She'll finish her college entrance exams next year.

313
00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:28,388
So I'll participate next year. Next year!

314
00:32:28,388 --> 00:32:32,038
Geez, what the hell is this bitch talking about?

315
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:33,558
You can't.

316
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:40,088
What? Hurry up and get going!

317
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,371
You asshole!

318
00:32:42,371 --> 00:32:45,781
- Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 - Oh, my gosh!

319
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:53,428
- Oh, my gosh! Help! 
 - Keep quiet!

320
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:56,138
- Let go! 
 - Oh, my goodness!

321
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:59,468
- Oh, geez. 
 - Wait.

322
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:13,802
First, go get Kyeong Ae.

323
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:16,639
Yes. Aunt...

324
00:33:20,675 --> 00:33:23,408
- Gosh! Let go! 
 - Give me back my money, punk!

325
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:25,938
Hey! You wench!

326
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:27,788
Hey!

327
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:16,559

328
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:35,411
Speaking of Soon Ae...

329
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,421
How do you know her?

330
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:43,801
I wasn't going to say anything to put you on the spot, but I was so curious.

331
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:46,581
It hasn't been that long since you transferred.

332
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,691
Never mind. As long as we have our friendship,

333
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:56,371
that's all that matters. Right?

334
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,531
You're right.

335
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:06,611
The person I like.

336
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:08,951
The love at first sight...

337
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:15,451
But you know what happened!

338
00:35:15,451 --> 00:35:18,261
I confessed my feelings, and she rejected me.

339
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:24,051
She said she was seeing someone, so she couldn't see anyone else.

340
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:28,351
Jerk. You're so honest.

341
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,451
Thanks for telling me.

342
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:35,721
What's that?

343
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:38,101
Why are you being like this?

344
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,931
- Should I give you? Should I give you? 
 - What? What?

345
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:45,131
G-Give me what?

346
00:35:45,131 --> 00:35:47,621
Soon Ae! Should I give her to you?

347
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:49,061
What?

348
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:53,281
I'm just joking! It's a joke.

349
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:09,849
Are you all right? Are you hurt anywhere?

350
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:11,389

351
00:36:13,851 --> 00:36:17,051
 Why now? Why already at this time?

352
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:20,541
 This is not the time we're supposed to meet.

353
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:25,669

354
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:29,151
 If he knows I'm the one who chased him that night,

355
00:36:29,151 --> 00:36:32,801
 then did Baek Yoo Seop enter this situation...

356
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,961
 because of me?

357
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:38,281
 Or is it because of Lee Kyeong Ae?

358
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:42,741
 Then did this event happen in the first place, or...

359
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:46,771
 is it a new event?

360
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:51,039

361
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:54,441
We are all right. Are you all right?

362
00:36:56,821 --> 00:37:00,281
Thank you. It must've been tough to get caught in the middle.

363
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:04,521
I was just passing by and thought I had to do something to help.

364
00:37:05,381 --> 00:37:08,231
- Just passing by? 
 - Yes.

365
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:13,811
Gosh! You guys saved the day!

366
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:15,861
They said to wait a little while here.

367
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:18,571
I just called the police.

368
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:25,831
What the heck is going on here?

369
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:33,021
We were just passing by and these scammers just...

370
00:37:33,021 --> 00:37:34,891
Arrest them all.

371
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:39,521
There's a possibility of human trafficking. It's going to be a big deal.

372
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:43,231
- Gosh, he must be a detective. Let's go. 
 - You're right.

373
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:45,211
- Detective! Mister! 
 - Are you the police?

374
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:46,851
 Help us!

375
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:50,351
 - Please help us get our money back! 
 - We lost 500,000 won!

376
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:54,851
 Please!

377
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,481
 Please!

378
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:01,051
 We have to get our money back!

379
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:09,559
 We're dead if we don't!

380
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:12,849

381
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:15,979

382
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:21,711
Do you really think they disappeared together?

383
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:28,711
In case things go wrong, do you remember what we agreed on last night?

384
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:31,011
Yes, I remember.

385
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:34,101
Then be careful.

386
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:41,831
 If, I'm just saying just in case.

387
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:45,411
 There shouldn't be such a case, but

388
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:50,471
 in the event that there's a new variable and we lose the victim...

389
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:58,991
 Oh, yes.

390
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:03,031
 Are you okay?

391
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:06,201
 It's no big deal. It'll stop soon.

392
00:39:09,031 --> 00:39:12,711
 Were you able to sleep properly since you got here?

393
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:14,271
 As far as I know, you haven't.

394
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,801
 Why is that important?

395
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:27,251
 You said the world is full of tragedies.

396
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:30,271
 So why are you trying this hard?

397
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:34,831
 In the end, everyone is a stranger to you.

398
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:38,961
 Just because you save everyone doesn't mean you will be saved.

399
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:43,271
 If it's as simple as just finding the culprit, then

400
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:45,981
 I feel like there must have been...

401
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:51,151
 easier and more comfortable ways to do that.

402
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:03,951
 Because that ground was too cold...

403
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:09,801

404
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:14,661
 When I first learned of my murder and went to look for it,

405
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:17,861
 it was already after the incident had happened.

406
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:20,881
 Because it was March.

407
00:40:20,881 --> 00:40:24,171
 The incident had happened two months before.

408
00:40:26,181 --> 00:40:28,811
 The only destination I could choose was the year,

409
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:33,421
 so if I wanted to meet the culprit, I could only wait there.

410
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:39,291
 Until January came around. For exactly ten months.

411
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:57,861
 They say we all die once, but...

412
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:00,871
 it was such a terrible ending.

413
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:17,171
 Simply due to a coincidence that I met a low-life in that time and place,

414
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:20,651
 everything ended in one moment.

415
00:41:24,211 --> 00:41:25,821

416
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:31,371
 It seemed too cold

417
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:34,131
 to lie there, abandoned like that.

418
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:57,601
 But when I realized there might be others like that,

419
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:00,321
 I became scared at that moment.

420
00:42:01,421 --> 00:42:04,361
 That I couldn't stop them while knowing what would happen.

421
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:12,151
 To know what happened means I can change things.

422
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:18,679
 And that's... a pretty heavy wish.

423
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:36,111
 You're responsible for wherever Baek Yoo Seop might go.

424
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:42,211
 Then what about you?

425
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,381
 I'll go to all the locations where the actual murders took place.

426
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:51,251

427
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:52,871

428
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:02,991

429
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:10,371
 You know what that means. Right?

430
00:43:14,921 --> 00:43:17,331
 I just hope I don't find anything.

431
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:18,881

432
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:20,761

433
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:29,951
 Because...

434
00:43:31,891 --> 00:43:34,621
 that would mean it's too late.

435
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:44,279

436
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:02,271
Do you think it's too late?

437
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:10,151
There hasn't been any evidence, so...

438
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:12,901
probably not yet.

439
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:16,351
Then, where and what do you think she's doing right now?

440
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:18,821
We looked everywhere we could.

441
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:26,101
That's right.

442
00:44:26,701 --> 00:44:29,791
They might be doing something right now.

443
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:33,861
If nothing really happened so far.

444
00:44:33,861 --> 00:44:36,961
They must be somewhere doing something. Right?

445
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:42,551
But don't you think we only looked at the obvious places?

446
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:46,621
Only places that could be crime scenes?

447
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,901
If she's with Baek Yoo Seop, then, of course...

448
00:44:57,951 --> 00:45:02,351
No. Then the scope becomes too wide.

449
00:45:03,131 --> 00:45:05,371
What time is it now?

450
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:07,551
9:10 p.m.

451
00:45:08,661 --> 00:45:13,211
Bong Bong Cafe. That was the last location on the police report.

452
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,331
The situation changed already. They can't be there.

453
00:45:16,331 --> 00:45:19,181
But we can't say they're definitely not there.

454
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:23,271
I know you became afraid because of the new variable, but...

455
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:25,511
you never know.

456
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:31,661
There may be a problem where the result remains the same, regardless of how the events occurred.

457
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:34,771
♫  It is time  ♫

458
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:37,711
♫  It is timeless love  ♫

459
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:40,901
♫  It is my heart hiding in the fog  ♫

460
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:44,371
♫  Love is what sparkles  ♫

461
00:45:44,371 --> 00:45:47,551
♫  Yesterday, too  ♫

462
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:50,831
♫  And today, too  ♫

463
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,831
♫  And yesterday, too  ♫

464
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:54,781
I can't stand people blocking the entrance.

465
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:56,491
Quickly take a seat.

466
00:45:56,491 --> 00:45:57,451
Together!

467
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,571
♫  I like you!  ♫

468
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:00,651
I like it!

469
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:03,681
♫  And you like me!  ♫

470
00:46:03,681 --> 00:46:06,841
♫  I like you!  ♫

471

472
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:25,331
♫  I wait for you every day  ♫

473
00:46:25,331 --> 00:46:27,211
♫  Heart fluttering...  ♫

474
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:29,021
You said we can't get caught.

475
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:31,021
Let's sit down for now.

476
00:46:31,611 --> 00:46:36,351
♫  You like me, and I like you  ♫

477
00:46:46,341 --> 00:46:50,371
Go Min Soo was a suspect, too. Right?

478
00:46:51,471 --> 00:46:55,261
He was imprisoned for more than 30 years as the culprit.

479
00:46:55,261 --> 00:46:56,801
Although he denied it to the end.

480
00:46:56,801 --> 00:46:59,261
That was Go Min Soo?

481
00:46:59,261 --> 00:47:01,281
Why? How?

482
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:04,721
There was some evidence, but

483
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:08,231
it was ultimately the witness who pointed him out.

484
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:11,381
She said she saw him commit the murder.

485
00:47:11,381 --> 00:47:15,021
His younger sister. Go Mi Sook.

486
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:20,221
The Go Mi Sook I know?

487
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,931
One of them must be lying.

488
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:33,051
So tonight, at least, we'll find out who was telling the truth.

489
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:50,141
She said she would break up with him.

490
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:57,811

491
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:06,681
I'm going to see my mom for a bit.

492
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:09,721
Right now, suddenly?

493
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,350
Make sure to let me know who lied.

494
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:20,600
Please take care of my aunt Lee Kyeong Ae.

495
00:48:22,283 --> 00:48:25,080
- Good job! 
  - Great!

496
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,670
Wow, thank you!

497
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,920
- Kyeong Ae, you're the best! 
 - Thank you!

498
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,449
Where should I go?

499
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:33,289

500
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:34,289

501
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:39,349
That punk...

502
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,149
 Let's go!

503
00:48:42,226 --> 00:48:43,949
 Bye!

504
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:47,359
- Good night! 
 - See you tomorrow!

505
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,779
- Goodbye! 
 - Bye!

506
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:56,659

507
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:00,259

508
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,263
How far are we going?

509
00:49:08,263 --> 00:49:11,903
Oh, I just have something to tell you.

510
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:16,669

511
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,029

512
00:49:25,279 --> 00:49:28,129
This is where Lee Joo Young was last.

513
00:49:32,715 --> 00:49:35,261
Geez, what are you doing?

514
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:38,021

515
00:49:41,991 --> 00:49:43,081

516
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:48,621
What are you doing? You said you wanted to talk about something.

517
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:50,931
You said you wanted to break up. Right?

518
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:54,541
All right. I'll give you what you want.

519
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:57,031
But you have to give me what I want.

520
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:58,631
Hey, Yoo Beom Ryong!

521
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:02,871
It's so disappointing for me to break up without having done anything!

522
00:50:02,871 --> 00:50:05,991
All that time I put into you.

523
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:08,261
Don't you think?

524
00:50:10,281 --> 00:50:13,741
Let go! Help! Help me!

525
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:16,041
Hey!

526
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:25,191
I said, let's just have one more drink together.

527
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:30,891
Hey, just because I sat at your table, you think I'm your friend now?

528
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:34,461
I only stopped by to see other guys.

529
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,431
I don't sit down with trash like you.

530
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:39,431
You talk pretty, don't you?

531
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,211
If you don't want to hear anything prettier, get lost.

532
00:50:43,211 --> 00:50:45,951
I'm in a bad mood today, anyway.

533
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,431
I was going to go home quietly today...

534
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:03,609

535
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:07,951
You hit me first.

536
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,441
Are you all right, Soon Ae?

537
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:21,501
Hey, numbskull. You didn't get hurt anywhere?

538
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:25,051
You scumbag.

539
00:51:25,051 --> 00:51:27,411
We're not friends anymore!

540
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:34,341
Let's go, Soon Ae.

541
00:51:42,341 --> 00:51:44,001
Shit!

542
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:57,841
Oh, my gosh. What do I do? What if he's dead?

543
00:51:57,841 --> 00:52:00,281
Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

544
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:04,011
He won't die.

545
00:52:15,311 --> 00:52:18,651
I-I-I think it's broken!

546
00:52:27,651 --> 00:52:29,371
It must be broken!

547
00:52:29,371 --> 00:52:33,001
Looks like you can't tie up strings for a while, then.

548
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:41,991
Please call my mom.

549
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:44,741
Mom!

550
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:49,391
Lee Kyeong Ae, let's go.

551
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:52,379

552
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:54,671
Why did you disappear earlier?

553
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,171
Didn't you hear me say to stay until the police arrive?

554
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:59,551
Is it really okay to leave him like that?

555
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,861
He's drunk, too.

556
00:53:01,861 --> 00:53:03,821
What if something happens to him?

557
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:07,591
That's okay. Because I'm the only eyewitness.

558
00:53:07,591 --> 00:53:11,421
I'm the only one who saw you push him.

559
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:14,571
W-Witness?

560
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:17,071
So just lay low and be careful for now.

561
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:20,281
Don't drink so much and go home early.

562
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:24,631
He'll make you pay big time if he catches you. You know, right?

563
00:53:24,631 --> 00:53:31,841
Yes. If I don't drink much and go home early...

564
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,671
How can I face my parents?

565
00:53:34,671 --> 00:53:38,501
How can I face my younger siblings? I would be so embarrassed.

566
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:39,331
What?

567
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:43,111
I'm 22 years old, and there's not one thing I can do right!

568
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:48,421
I'm already pathetic, and I just got scammed on top of that!

569
00:53:48,421 --> 00:53:51,901
Now, I really don't have the right to live!

570
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:54,481
Gosh, Lee Kyeong Ae...

571
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,071
Good god! I can't live like this.

572
00:53:58,961 --> 00:54:04,821
To be honest, Miss Korea wasn't going to work out anyway.

573
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:11,871
But from my observations so far,

574
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:15,411
it's generally true that you're Woojeong Village's Kim Wan Sun.

575
00:54:15,411 --> 00:54:19,121
Your dance moves at the club aren't bad, and

576
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:22,171
you're pretty funny in front of your friends.

577
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:26,471
And you have some sense of style.

578
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,440
Even if it's not Miss Korea, many people go on TV.

579
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,461
As long as you head in the right direction, so what if you're 22 years old?

580
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:35,191
That's young enough. You'll be fine.

581
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:37,384
Do you really...

582
00:54:37,384 --> 00:54:40,364
think that?

583
00:54:41,251 --> 00:54:44,751
You're not trying to scam me or anything. Right?

584
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:47,031
You lost all your money already. How would you get scammed anyway?

585
00:54:47,031 --> 00:54:49,251
Oh, gosh! That money.

586
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:54,931
Oh, I was going to give that for Soon Ae's tuition! Seriously...

587
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:58,571
You didn't scam anyone yourself, did you?

588
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:00,931
You'd better not spend it all on drinking!

589
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:02,241
Excuse me?

590
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:04,821
Here.

591
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:10,641
I just took it earlier. You can take it.

592
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:12,981
Oh, my!

593
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:14,871
Oh, my goodness!

594
00:55:15,621 --> 00:55:17,271
Oh, my gosh!

595
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:20,451
This...

596
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:22,661
I mean...

597
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:24,841
Can I kiss you?

598
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:28,031
- What? 
 - No, you can't. Get inside!

599
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:36,131
Hey, Lee Soon Ae!

600
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:41,711
Do you know what happened to me today because of this?

601
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:46,421
- Sis! 
 - I'm so sorry, Soon Ae.

602
00:55:46,421 --> 00:55:50,841
- Forgive me. 
 - I'm sorry!

603
00:55:53,429 --> 00:55:58,899

604
00:56:12,229 --> 00:56:15,849

605
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:31,561
Thank you for everything today.

606
00:56:33,881 --> 00:56:36,461
I didn't see the culprit in the end.

607
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:42,041
I was hoping we'd be out of the fog, but I don't know what else went wrong.

608
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:46,131
So now, we only have one more chance.

609
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:53,981
But at least things became quite clear.

610
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:56,081
That's enough for today.

611
00:56:56,081 --> 00:57:04,771
♫  If you tell me the words "I love you"  ♫

612
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:08,621
♫  If you would tell me that  ♫

613
00:57:33,601 --> 00:57:35,491
Hello?

614
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:57,301
Who are you?

615
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:08,901
 Mr. Yoon.

616
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:10,711
Yoo Beom Ryong?

617
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:17,782
 She's dead.

618
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:33,141
She's dead, Mr. Yoon.

619
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,711
 She's dead.

620
00:58:55,301 --> 00:58:57,711
 In the end, that's what happened.

621
00:59:22,299 --> 00:59:30,599

622

♫  I found the meaning of life the moment you came to me  ♫

623
00:59:39,101 --> 00:59:44,711
♫  I'll give your heart a pretty bouquet of flowers  ♫

627
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:57,261
 What happened?

628
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,631
 You need to explain.

629
00:59:58,631 --> 01:00:00,901
 What you saw. What you did.

630
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:03,131
 You need to explain everything from beginning to end.

631
01:00:03,131 --> 01:00:04,731
 So she hadn't left?

632
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:07,501
 The time and place changed. But the person is still dead.

633
01:00:07,501 --> 01:00:09,311
 No one had died in that spot.

634
01:00:09,311 --> 01:00:11,824
 Everything starts from scratch, and this is our end.

635
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:15,284
 She's not even from our town. Why did she have to die here?

636
01:00:17,828 --> 01:00:20,123
 Why do you look so serious?

637
01:00:20,123 --> 01:00:22,811
 Relax your face.

638
01:00:22,811 --> 01:00:24,465
 It shows.

639
01:00:24,465 --> 01:00:27,765
♫  Your face full of moonlight  ♫
