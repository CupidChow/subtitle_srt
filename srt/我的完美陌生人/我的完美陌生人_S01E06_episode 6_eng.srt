1
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,699

2
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:51,827

3
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:54,444

4
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:05,484

5
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,900
By chance, do you know what time it is right now?

6
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:38,550
Then, do you know...

7
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,030
what it feels like waiting for someone who went out to see the murderer alone at night?

8
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,750
You said you'd see his face, but you've been gone for over three hours!

9
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,050
Wow, what is this?

10
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,500
I thought maybe you got hurt like last time while following him.

11
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,920
Are you hurt?

12
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,610
No.

13
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,290
It's not like I can call the police or go out myself!

14
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,490
I can't even make a phone call in this damn year of 1987!

15
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,690
I thought I was going crazy!

16
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

17
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,150
Did the man with the blue cap show up?

18
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,490
Yes.

19
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,410
Who was it?

20
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,370

21
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,917

22
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,910
 Your father.

23
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,090
 Baek Hee Seop.

24
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,360
This is nuts.

25
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,520

26
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,690
 May 14th, 1987.

27
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,340
 Two days before the first murder takes place,

28
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,510
 the person who met the victim, Lee Joo Young, was her dad?

29
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,450
 No, it can't be. If the one with the blue cap really is the suspect,

30
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:56,010
 then it means he killed her mom and his own wife.

31
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,140
And then, me.

32
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,360
 I can't overthink it.

33
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,020
 I have to think calmly and level-headedly.

34
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,210
 Let me get this straight.

35
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,650
 According to how things were, Lee Joo Young arrived seven minutes earlier.

36
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,720
 If it was how things should have been,

37
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,120
 I was planning to go to the cafe after school tonight.

38
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,960
I wanted to drink coffee by myself and finish reading my book.

39
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,600
I really didn't have any plans to meet anyone.

40
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,110
 But she ran into someone she wasn't planning to meet.

41
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,800
 The guy with the blue cap. Baek Hee Seop.

42
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,020
 Whatever the reason may be, an argument started between the two.

43
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,010
 There was someone who saw the incident at the same time.

44
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,680
 Bong Bong Cafe's owner...

45
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,170
 Where did she go?

46
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,190
Hi, there!

47
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,920
There were other people.

48
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,510
- Oh, you came. 
 - Sorry, sorry.

49
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,860
I heard a crazy rumor, which is why I'm a little late.

50
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,860
You know how the whole school flipped out this morning because of that student teacher?

51
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,890
Do you know why?

52
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,270
Turns out...

53
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,630
she's a commie!

54
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,030
Don't you watch the news?

55
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,570
The college students' crazy demonstrations!

56
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,530
Even that weird song she sang at the picnic last time

57
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,410
is the kind of song they sing in places like that.

58
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,320
She was probably trying to brainwash us, too.

59
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,430
Isn't that so creepy?

60
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,210
- Yeah, it's creepy. 
 - Right?

61
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,490
Wow, it's really mind-boggling.

62
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,050
Even my mom and dad were saying...

63
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,160
How can a friend do something like this?

64
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,100
How did you know?

65
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,950
I wondered why I never smelled anything whenever you took a dump.

66
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,490
 Yoo Beom Ryong! Are you done yet?

67
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,390
 Y-Yeah!

68
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,720
 It's a bigger load today.

69
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,950
 Hey, I don't know what's happening, but there's a commotion at school.

70
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,510
 There are a bunch of cops looking for the student teacher.

71
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,500
 - Who are they looking for? 
 - The student teacher.

72
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,280
 Oh, geez. That guy.

73
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,580
 That punk didn't even flush. That dirty guy!

74
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:06,487

75
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,140
That belongs to the student teacher, right?

76
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,590
Did you steal it?

77
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,620
Are you going to tell?

78
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,610
What?

79
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,960
About this...

80
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,890
Are you going to tell anyone?

81
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,130
So did you do this knowing it was wrong?

82
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,910
Stealing from someone and hiding it in the bathroom corner...

83
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,370
Hey, if Soon Ae found out you do this kind of thing...

84
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,310
Soon Ae?

85
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,100
How do you know my girlfriend's name?

86
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,060
So what if I do!

87
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,850
Have you thought about how hurt she will be?

88
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,070
You shouldn't do anything shameful to the person you like.

89
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,010
That's the basic rule for guys.

90
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:33,397

91
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,970
Wait! Wait a minute!

92
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,310
Hee Seop!

93
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,480
Wait! Wait!

94
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,260
All right. All right.

95
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,550
I'll return it to her.

96
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,860
I'll personally apologize and say that I did something stupid out of curiosity.

97
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,110
I'll return it to her.

98
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,620
So, give it to me.

99
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,580
I mean it!

100
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:07,540
Just as you said, to the girl I like, and more than anything, to you, the friend I like...

101
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,130
I don't want to do anything shameful.

102
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,090
All right, I'll keep it a secret.

103
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,350
I said I won't tell anyone.

104
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,970
I'll pretend I didn't see anything. So you better keep your promise.

105
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,110
Thank you, my partner.

106
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,400
Hee Seop!

107
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,060
Yeah.

108
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,340
Hello.

109
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,690
You're friends with our Hee Seop?

110
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,750
What's wrong?

111
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:06,367

112
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,040
 Yoo Beom Ryong is the one who stole Lee Joo Young's ring.

113
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,070
 The blue cap who ran away from the bridge that night was Baek Hee Seop.

114
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,100
 At the time, Baek Hee Seop had a companion.

115
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,510
 But Yoo Beom Ryong went in the same direction as the victim.

116
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,630
 Lee Joo Young's route...

117
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,290

118
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,707
 [Ilshin Photography

119
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:18,887

120
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:27,467

121
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:29,667

122
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,420

123
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,400
 I said hurry up!

124
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,500
 Are you joking with me right now?

125
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,390
Go Min Soo?

126
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,640
 It really was unfair.

127
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,610
 I wasn't even in Woojeong Village on the day of the incident.

128
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,750
 At the time, I was staying at a boarding school in the countryside.

129
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,200
 My mom sent me there to focus on my studies.

130
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,750
 It was deep in the mountains where they didn't even have phones.

131
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,080
Do you want to die? Yeah?

132
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,230
Why is Go Min Soo...

133
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,540
Come on!  If I ask you to give it to me,

134
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,380
you should quickly hand it over.

135
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,210
You talk too much, bitch.

136
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,430
Huh?

137
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,000
Is this your money? Huh?

138
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,310
You stole this from Mom's wallet anyway.

139
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,300
Isn't that right?

140
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,130
Mi Sook.

141
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,120
Pathetic loser.

142
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,990
Mom kicked you out in the end.

143
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,410
What's with the bravado?

144
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,630
Shit!

145
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,510
Are you okay?

146
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,980
Geez, seriously!

147
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Damn it!

148
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,420
Hey! Ow, it hurts!

149
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,440
My arm, my arm! My arm, arm!

150
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,090
I regret saving trash like you in the future!

151
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,330
What should I do with you?

152
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,510
This is all because of you, asshole!

153
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,260
- Because of you! 
 - Are you all right?

154
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,780
Go to the nearest public phone and report it to the police.

155
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,310
That place isn't that trustworthy, but we need to at least keep a damn record.

156
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,690
I'll make sure he gets charged for his crime this time, no matter what.

157
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,460
Go Mi Sook. Think very carefully.

158
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,650
I don't want to...

159
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,940
report this.

160
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,780
I got my money back anyway.

161
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,890
He'll return to the boarding school after blowing off some steam.

162
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,260
That's enough.

163
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,750
If we have to deal with his troubles again,

164
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,450
my mom will kill me.

165
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,130
So...

166
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,190
I'd like to keep this between us.

167
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:20,907

168
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,020

169
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,537

170
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:48,467

171
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,870
They're all driving me crazy, going around all over.

172
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,880
 Lee Joo Young's movement tonight.

173
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,940
 One of the people in that vicinity has the highest probability of being the culprit.

174
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,600
 But all three suspects were there tonight.

175
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,800
All right, I'll keep it a secret.

176
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,960
I said I wouldn't tell anyone.

177
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,180

178
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,730
All right.

179
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,430
I'll return it. I'll apologize and I'll return it.

180
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,210
I'll stay away from this neighborhood.

181
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,980
That's good, right?

182
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:12,317

183
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:25,197

184
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:30,920
 Everyone there is telling their own lies.

185
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,020
 Why?

186
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,127
 Exactly why?

187
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:43,397

188
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,920
Why aren't you saying anything?

189
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,690
The one with the blue cap.

190
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,910
He's the one who might have killed my mom. You saw him, right?

191
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,510
Who was it? Was it someone we knew?

192
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,290
I couldn't check.

193
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,950
I lost him like last time.

194
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,600
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

195
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,980
You're lying.

196
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,910
You said you didn't get hurt, but you did.

197
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,580
- It must hurt every time your shirt... 
 - Oh, yeah.

198
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,420
It's nothing.

199
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,910
How is Lee Joo Young?

200
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,110
She seems a little nervous, but she's doing all right.

201
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,380
She's worried that the police may catch on and follow her here.

202
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,810
Then that'll get us in trouble, too.

203
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,000
Don't worry.

204
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,670
No one will be able to come here tonight.

205
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:15,757
 Yoon Young.

206
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,707
 Yoon Young!

207
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,017
Yoon Young!

208
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,577
If you're going to whisper, then don't knock.

209
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:34,007
If you're going to knock, then don't whisper.

210
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:37,347
Shouldn't you decide on one strategy?

211
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:42,507
I'm sorry at this late hour. Is Yoon Young here?

212
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:48,157
Yoon Young! Are you all right?

213
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:49,507
Me? Why?

214
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,457
I heard everything from my dad!

215
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:57,117
That there was a terrible incident involving a knife at the terminal.

216
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:59,357
You must have been very scared.

217
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:01,277
Oh, it's nothing.

218
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:03,277
What do you mean, "nothing"?

219
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:10,747
By any chance, are you planning to have Yoon Young sleep in the same place as the

220
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,037
student teacher tonight?

221
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:15,107
What?

222
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:18,077
Oh, no.

223
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:21,627
Then shall I have her sleep at my place? Just one night?

224
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:25,627
Y-Yes. T-That would be good.

225
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:29,987
Oh, I didn't think of that.

226
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:32,587
You can go.

227
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:38,447
No, it's all right. There was just some misunderstanding.

228
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,347
Just take a break.

229
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:46,397
Use that excuse.

230
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:50,667
You said you came straight here after she passed away.

231
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:55,377
Even just for one night, stay by your mom's side.

232
00:22:55,377 --> 00:22:57,607
This is a good opportunity.

233
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:24,357
♫  The loneliness below countless stars on a chilly night  ♫

234
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:34,927
♫  No matter who I say it is, they would not understand this feeling  ♫

235
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:39,267
♫  To you again  ♫

236
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,327
Is my room a little messy?

237
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,257
I try to keep it clean.

238
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,987
But my mom scolds and slaps my back first.

239
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:49,487
She even threatens to throw things out while I'm not here.

240
00:23:49,487 --> 00:23:52,317
Whoa. My mom was exactly the same way.

241
00:23:52,317 --> 00:23:54,207
Right?

242
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:57,587
I don't know why all moms are like that.

243
00:23:58,547 --> 00:24:02,967
Even if I had a daughter one day, I would never do that to her.

244
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,747
I'll go wash up. Make yourself comfortable.

245
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:09,597
Okay, go wash up.

246
00:24:11,257 --> 00:24:20,787
♫  If you could tell me in some way that you love me  ♫

247
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:23,847
♫  If you could  ♫

248
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:32,297
No, it can't be. There's no way he would hide it from me.

249
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:50,217
Who are you calling... at this time of night?

250
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:53,147
I heard you were nervous all day?

251
00:24:53,147 --> 00:24:55,217
I'm checking the barricade.

252
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:59,687

253
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:02,437
 Why do you even need to check?

254
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:06,227
I'm losing my mind here!

255
00:25:07,227 --> 00:25:08,547
Geez.

256
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:12,487
Yes, everyone is gathered here.

257
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:13,847
- Director Yoon. 
 - Wait a minute.

258
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,737
What are you doing here? It's your turn.

259
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:18,267
All right, all right.

260
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,427
Okay, wait just a bit.

261
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:23,127
- Let's go, let's go. 
 - Applause! Applause!

262
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:29,867
Director Yoon is singing! Big applause!

263
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:34,777
No, no, no. I'll pass on singing.

264
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:39,777
For those working hard for our crime-free village and peaceful Woojeong Village,

265
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:43,687
the happiness of our policemen is all we need!

266
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:45,957
Applause!

267
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:53,237
As I mentioned, as our town's leader, tonight's dinner is on me!

268
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:56,277
So, no one should think about going home tonight.

269
00:25:56,277 --> 00:26:02,217
- Eat and drink as much as you want, okay? 
  - Yes, yes!

270
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:05,607
Here's to the happiness and prosperity of the Woojeong Village police!

271
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,597
- Cheers! 
  - Cheers!

272
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,597
 Cook some more meat on the grill, and

273
00:26:15,597 --> 00:26:18,377
 give them more drinks over there.

274
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:22,387
How did you do that?

275
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:26,437
There's no way the principal wouldn't know about the student teacher with a criminal record.

276
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:30,127
He just wanted to help me.

277
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:32,947
I'm just letting the person who started this wrap it up.

278
00:26:32,947 --> 00:26:35,277
You don't need to be concerned.

279
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:42,917
Yes, as we discussed earlier, could you hold them there until early morning?

280
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:47,207
 - Have one more! 
 - Here, take it.

281
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,877
Hey, sit down!

282
00:26:55,457 --> 00:27:00,127
Can't you tell we're taking care of the repercussions for turning the school upside down?

283
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:01,747
Move.

284
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:06,267
Hey, the chief says he's too embarrassed to face Director Yoon.

285
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:13,467
Honestly, you didn't even have a clear charge against her.

286
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:16,867
Tell me. Didn't you just want to arrest a protester from Seoul

287
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:20,157
and improve your image?

288
00:27:30,707 --> 00:27:34,707
Captain, you're the one who said it was a sin to look suspicious.

289
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:39,577
You also said we could create a charge once we capture and beat the crap out of them.

290
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:44,627
So who needs to clean up his image?

291
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:47,307
You punk, how dare you?

292
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:50,177
- Let go! 
 - Are you crazy?

293
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:54,107
I have to go pick up the kids. Okay?

294
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:56,517
- Oh, man. 
 - Hey!

295
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:59,817
What's going on here right now!

296
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:02,667
Just when I'm about to relieve my anger...

297
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,437
Captain, are you going to be like this?

298
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:05,727
I'm sorry.

299
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,207
Dong Shik.

300
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:08,817
Yes.

301
00:28:10,377 --> 00:28:14,207
Why? Yong Woo and Yong Soon are not at home?

302
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:19,807
Well, my wife went to her parent's place to care for her father, so

303
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:23,567
she left the kids at the persimmon tree house down the street.

304
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,197
Oh, I see.

305
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:30,197
 That punk, Baek Dong Shik.

306
00:28:30,197 --> 00:28:32,887
 He brought all the cops to our school today, and

307
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:36,867
 turned the school upside down. It's all his fault.

308
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:39,917
 We don't know when and how he will make a move.

309
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,067
Geez, I thought it was something more serious!

310
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,487
Do you know what time it is right now?

311
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:47,567
You can just have them sleep there. No big deal.

312
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:49,467
Sit down. You sit down, too.

313
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,977
Sit, sit.

314
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:54,447
Oh, the kids will like that.

315
00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:57,607
- Their grandson is around your kids' age, right? 
 - Yes.

316
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:59,317
- Right? 
 - Yes.

317
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:03,987
I'll call the lady of the persimmon tree house, too, so don't worry.

318
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:07,237
Don't even think about moving

319
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:10,557
until the sun comes up. Okay? Here.

320
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:13,437
- I'm sorry for the trouble, Director! 
 - No, no.

321
00:29:13,437 --> 00:29:16,697
Let's show our singing talents to Director Yoon!

322
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:18,527
Yes!

323
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:21,467
 One, two, three, four!

324
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:13,317
Is something on your mind?

325
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:16,047
You can't seem to fall asleep.

326
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,867
You're up?

327
00:30:21,797 --> 00:30:23,837
Just...

328
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:29,177
I keep thinking.

329
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:30,777
What?

330
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:37,177
What are you thinking about so much that you can't sleep?

331
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:41,917
Baek Hee Seop.

332
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:44,707
What? Already?

333
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:48,717
Hey! You said you already have a boyfriend!

334
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,677
I'm trash.

335
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:55,927
What should I do?

336
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:58,237
Oh, my head hurts.

337
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:02,837
I can't take a break even for one night.

338
00:31:02,837 --> 00:31:04,527
Hey.

339
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:07,707
You haven't even known Baek Hee Seop for that long.

340
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:11,817
You don't even know what kind of person he is!

341
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:16,577
That's why I asked him.

342
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:21,357
That night at Bong Bong.

343
00:31:35,387 --> 00:31:40,097
 But what is it about me that you like?

344
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:42,457
 You don't even know me well.

345
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:46,317
 You just transferred, and you don't even know what kind of person I am.

346
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:48,267
 Why would I not know?

347
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:51,727
 I could tell what kind of person you were the moment I first saw you.

348
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,690
 What kind of person am I?

349
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,127
 Frighteningly pretty.

350
00:32:06,857 --> 00:32:12,037
 And also... you possess your own poetic world.

351
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,237
 The first time I met you,

352
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:21,717
 you were in that small ticket booth with your favorite music on the radio.

353
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:23,807
 You were writing something down that

354
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:26,917
 you didn't even know I was standing there.

355
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:29,927
 You were completely immersed in your own poetic world.

356
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:32,887
 You didn't even know how pretty you looked.

357
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:37,927
 Or how bright you made that tiny little place look.

358
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:41,167
 And as if you had no care in the world,

359
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:44,967
 you were smiling to yourself.

360
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:49,267
 I've never seen...

361
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,817
 anyone cool like that before.

362
00:32:54,717 --> 00:32:58,187
His face was shining so bright.

363
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:02,127
♫  Susan, my heart longs to see you  ♫

364
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:06,187
The way he was talking to me,

365
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:10,247
the expression on his face when he was telling me that,

366
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,817
even his shaky voice,

367
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:17,137
all of it.

368
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:22,507
♫  And come back to me  ♫

369
00:33:24,317 --> 00:33:26,817
 The never-ending moment.

370
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:29,117

371
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:31,927

372
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,380
 Hey Y, do you know?

373
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:43,507
 Some moments are endless.

374
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:54,557
 His shimmering words from that day repeatedly played in my mind.

375
00:33:55,357 --> 00:33:56,677
 Get out!

376
00:33:56,677 --> 00:34:02,677
 If you are like this, just go take care of her for the rest of your life!

377
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:28,997
 No matter what kind of darkness comes into my life,

378
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:33,147
 if I can just hold onto those glimmering words,

379
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:37,487
 I felt like I wouldn't fear anything.

380
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:42,387
 The boy who recognized my world at first sight.

381
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:46,337
 What was his world like?

382
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:52,107
 I'm becoming more curious about that.

383
00:34:55,277 --> 00:35:00,497
 The guy who appeared in all my mom's novels was

384
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:03,267
Baek Hee Seop.

385
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:06,977
What?

386
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:20,687
Are you sleeping?

387
00:35:20,687 --> 00:35:23,607
What do I do?

388
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:30,317
 Baek Hee Seop.

389
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:45,747
 I came because I have something to return to the student teacher.

390
00:35:56,727 --> 00:36:00,007
 Well, right now, I just...

391
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:02,497
 I'm taking a walk?

392
00:36:02,497 --> 00:36:07,277
 One of the actual suspects, the blue cap who was behind the veil.

393
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:12,887
 Even matching all the movements, and currently the one most likely the culprit.

394
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:18,677
 But why would the person returning the stolen ring try to kill her?

395
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,527
 Something doesn't make sense.

396
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:27,197
Am I hoping things don't make sense?

397
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,800

398
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,807

399
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:40,517
I packed all my essentials, Mr. Yoon.

400
00:36:40,517 --> 00:36:43,447
- Let's go, then. 
 - Yes.

401
00:36:58,297 --> 00:37:01,687
How did I meet such a dangerous neighbor?

402
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:10,647
You should be safe once you leave this town,

403
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:14,447
but just in case, call me as soon as you arrive at your friend's house.

404
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:17,727
- My phone number is... 
 - I know.

405
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:22,447
You told me the day I arrived here.

406
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,757
- Right. 
 - Yes.

407
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:32,557
I know it doesn't make any sense, but

408
00:37:32,557 --> 00:37:39,237
you seem like someone who came on purpose to save me, Mr. Yoon.

409
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:43,317
As though you were waiting, knowing I would be here.

410
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:50,507
It seems like you were thinking for a long time about how to rescue me.

411
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:52,277
How could that be?

412
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:53,917
Right?

413
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:58,167
I know that couldn't be true, but you helped me out like that.

414
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:00,127
Thank you.

415
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:03,717
If it weren't for you, Mr. Yoon,

416
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:07,057
I don't know where I would be right now.

417
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:11,180
I'm truly grateful to you.

418
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,320

419
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,157
Here.

420
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:21,817
Don't lose it.

421
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:29,717
Live a long, healthy life until you're a grandma.

422
00:38:29,717 --> 00:38:31,877
You, too, Mr. Yoon.

423
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:39,237
Oh, it's coming.

424
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,530

425
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,707
Have a safe trip.

426
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,100

427
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,997
The buses are already running?

428
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:27,027
Hey, hey, hey!

429
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:29,867
Hey! Hey!

430
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,507
Hey! Here!

431
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,687
You!

432
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:56,597
You, punk!

433
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:59,187
You! Shit!

434
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:00,947
You asshole.

435
00:40:00,947 --> 00:40:06,877
I saw you under the bridge that day, daring to signal to the police

436
00:40:06,877 --> 00:40:10,357
secretly to help the protester.

437
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:14,167
I thought you were just an oblivious teacher, but

438
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,407
now I see you were on the same team.

439
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:18,077
Is that right?

440
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:21,417
How much did you drink?

441
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:25,027
What team are you talking about? I was just passing by.

442
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:28,767
Is that so? We'll find out the details when we dig deeper.

443
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:30,727
Let's talk at the police station.

444
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:32,947
Why are you taking a perfectly normal person?

445
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:36,287
Shut up and follow me, you punk!

446
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:57,647
Oh, my goodness! What do we do?

447
00:40:57,647 --> 00:41:00,077
Oh, Noonim!

448
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:04,497
What happened? Is there a fire?

449
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:08,537
They said there's a huge fire at the persimmon tree house!

450
00:41:08,537 --> 00:41:09,977
- W-Where? 
 - Gosh!

451
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:13,277
That persimmon tree house where the grandma lives with her grandson!

452
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:16,807
Gosh, I hope they're okay. What to do...

453
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:20,887
 The fire incident on the 15th.

454
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:23,537
 There weren't any casualties, though.

455
00:41:24,337 --> 00:41:27,277
My kids are there in that house.

456
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:33,757
What are you talking about? There should only be two people there.

457
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:38,447
I should have picked them up last night.

458
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:41,527
But I couldn't pick them up...

459
00:41:41,527 --> 00:41:44,027
Oh, no!

460
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:47,017
Oh no! What do we do? What do we do?

461
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:50,657
What should we do? What to do, Dong Shik?

462
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:52,467
Yong Soon!

463
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:55,757
Oh, no! What do we do?

464
00:41:57,187 --> 00:42:00,207
Yong Woo! Yong Soon!

465
00:42:02,137 --> 00:42:03,787
Yong Woo!

466
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,367
Yong Woo! Yong Soon!

467
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:08,907
Yong Woo! Yong Soon!

468
00:42:08,907 --> 00:42:11,297
- Here, here! 
 - Over here!

469
00:42:11,297 --> 00:42:13,127
Yong Soon!

470
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:15,297
Yong Soon! Are you all right?

471
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:17,397
Yong Soon! Yong Soon!

472
00:42:17,397 --> 00:42:20,187
Yong Soon, Daddy's sorry!

473
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,507
Ma'am, where are the other children?

474
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:28,747
I don't know.

475
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:33,007
I thought I brought my grandson out with me, but...

476
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:36,197
- Oh no! 
 - Oh, my gosh!

477
00:42:36,197 --> 00:42:39,807
- Oh no! 
 - It's going to collapse!

478
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:42,267
Yong Woo!

479
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:44,327
Yong Woo!

480
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,477
Yong Woo!

481
00:42:51,297 --> 00:42:53,757
Yong Woo!

482
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:58,177
- Yong Woo! 
 - Yong Woo! Yong Woo!

483
00:42:58,177 --> 00:43:00,707
- Yong Woo! 
 - Yong Woo!

484
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:03,457
 Could you please hold them there until early morning?

485
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:05,847
 Especially Baek Dong Shik.

486
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:08,927
 He brought over all the police to our school today, and

487
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,937
 turned the school upside down. It's all his fault.

488
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:15,347
 I should have picked them up last night.

489
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:18,947
 But I couldn't pick them up...

490
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:20,677
Yong Woo!

491
00:43:20,677 --> 00:43:22,567
Yong Woo!

492
00:43:24,457 --> 00:43:26,357
Yong Woo!

493
00:43:26,357 --> 00:43:28,677
Ow, it's hot!

494
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:31,317
Yong Woo!

495
00:43:31,957 --> 00:43:34,247
Yong Woo!

496
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:36,677
Yong Woo!

497
00:43:36,677 --> 00:43:38,497
Yong Woo!

498
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:40,637
Yong Woo!

499
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:42,787
- Dong Shik, he's in here! 
 - Yong Woo!

500
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,237
Where?

501
00:43:44,237 --> 00:43:46,667
Quickly move this! Hurry!

502
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,337
Yong Woo! Yong Woo!

503
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:54,037
Yong Woo! Yong Woo!

504
00:43:55,597 --> 00:43:59,057
Yong Woo! Yong Woo, wake up!

505
00:43:59,057 --> 00:44:01,097
Oh, Yong Woo!

506
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:04,357
Yong Woo! Yong Woo!

507
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:09,167
Yong Woo, are you all right? I'm so sorry...

508
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:11,377
- Goodness! 
 - Thank goodness!

509
00:44:11,377 --> 00:44:13,577
- What a relief! 
 - Oh, my goodness!

510
00:44:13,577 --> 00:44:14,957
That was amazing...

511
00:44:14,957 --> 00:44:18,097
 - You should get home. 
 - Really, what a relief!

512
00:44:18,097 --> 00:44:20,457
Brother!

513
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:24,487
- Uncle! 
 - Take your teacher to the hospital.

514
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:25,997
Pardon?

515
00:44:32,247 --> 00:44:34,377
Your watch is damaged, too!

516
00:44:34,377 --> 00:44:36,467
Let's hurry to the hospital.

517
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:46,797
What are you doing? I said let's go!

518
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,110

519
00:45:05,147 --> 00:45:08,577
 What I did to help Lee Joo Young leave safely

520
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:10,947
 became another variable.

521
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:14,427
 And that variable created another situation.

522
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:22,077
 In exchange for saving the person who was meant to die,

523
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:28,307
 I almost killed the people who were supposed to stay alive.

524
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,220

525
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:02,387
Did Lee Joo Young leave okay...

526
00:46:03,877 --> 00:46:06,097
Did something happen?

527
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,507
Oh, it's nothing.

528
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:11,897
Did you have a good time with your mom?

529
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:14,147
Yes.

530
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:16,987
What are you doing with that?

531
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,977
I think I can figure it out.

532
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,077
- What do you mean? 
 - The one with the blue cap.

533
00:46:23,077 --> 00:46:27,617
This might have an answer.

534
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:41,967
A novel isn't a report.

535
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:48,537
Just because it was based on real events doesn't mean she would write their real names.

536
00:46:48,537 --> 00:46:53,237
I didn't think Go Mi Sook's novel mentioned anything about a blue cap.

537
00:46:53,237 --> 00:46:56,937
But then, there was a similar character in her story.

538
00:46:57,637 --> 00:47:00,717
A man with blue hair.

539
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:06,347
All this time I thought the "blue head" in this story was talking about blue hair.

540
00:47:06,347 --> 00:47:07,817
Ow!

541
00:47:11,197 --> 00:47:14,517
What happened, exactly?

542
00:47:14,517 --> 00:47:18,127
Do I need to tell you everything?

543
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,897
Do I need to share every single thing that happens here?

544
00:47:21,897 --> 00:47:24,017
Do you do that?

545
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:27,477
Were we even close enough to do that?

546
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:38,590
You know, don't you?

547
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:44,127
The one with the blue cap.

548
00:47:45,457 --> 00:47:48,167
You're not even curious to find out.

549
00:47:50,477 --> 00:47:52,807
You found out who it is.

550
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:56,367
You didn't lose him at the cafe last night.

551
00:47:59,987 --> 00:48:04,227
You have no reason to tell me, but you don't have reasons to hide it from me, either. Why?

552
00:48:04,227 --> 00:48:08,397
- Why, exactly? 
 - I'll tell you since you seem to be mistaken.

553
00:48:08,397 --> 00:48:10,557
Think carefully.

554
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:17,107
Do you think I'm here putting all in to chase criminals just to chase news?

555
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:19,827
Because I feel sorry for the victims who died?

556
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:22,477
The world is full of such tragedies.

557
00:48:22,477 --> 00:48:26,667
I don't have the time to go around rescuing all those people!

558
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:29,587
Then, what's your reason?

559
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:37,547
I'm a victim, also. I'm the fifth victim.

560
00:48:39,947 --> 00:48:42,857
Because they never caught the suspect here,

561
00:48:42,857 --> 00:48:45,847
I was going to die like your mom.

562
00:48:45,847 --> 00:48:48,037
That's why I'm here to save my life.

563
00:48:48,037 --> 00:48:51,727
Everything that happened in this town in 1987!

564
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:56,067
I came here with all the data from newspapers, news broadcasts, and even police reports!

565
00:48:56,067 --> 00:49:00,497
But because of one little variable, now everything might change!

566
00:49:00,497 --> 00:49:04,237
Just thinking about that, I feel like my head will explode.

567
00:49:05,587 --> 00:49:07,767
But you know what?

568
00:49:09,327 --> 00:49:12,827
Do you know who the biggest variable is here?

569
00:49:14,677 --> 00:49:18,327
Is that why you sent me to my mom's last night?

570
00:49:20,277 --> 00:49:23,997
Because I shouldn't be curious about such variables,

571
00:49:24,654 --> 00:49:27,097
and don't interfere with anything.

572
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,857
Just take a break...

573
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:32,907
and stay out of your way.

574
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:39,257
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

575
00:49:40,005 --> 00:49:45,677
As long as I'm here, I can't sit here like an idiot and wait.

576
00:49:47,757 --> 00:49:50,287
If you don't want me to know, that's fine.

577
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:53,577
I'll find out on my own.

578
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,360

579
00:50:05,787 --> 00:50:08,707
I feel so uncomfortable here.

580
00:50:10,246 --> 00:50:13,527
What if Beom Ryong cries and tries to hold onto me?

581
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:16,987
He said I'm the only one for him in this world.

582
00:50:18,377 --> 00:50:20,017
What are you doing?

583
00:50:20,837 --> 00:50:22,967
Hey, Baek Yoon Young.

584
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:33,147
 The afternoon when the body of the first woman was discovered,

585
00:50:33,147 --> 00:50:37,677
 several suspicious scenes occurred in the town.

586
00:50:37,677 --> 00:50:42,677
 The man with the blue hair stood between the sun and the moon.

587
00:50:42,677 --> 00:50:48,877
 The man with the glasses didn't come out of the third stall for a long while.

588
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:55,037
 The man who lost his memory didn't realize he was lying under the bridge.

589
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:06,027
 Since today is the day they would've discovered Lee Joo Young dead,

590
00:51:06,027 --> 00:51:09,357
 this will take place this afternoon.

591
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:13,987
 If the blue-haired man really means the blue cap, then...

592
00:51:17,647 --> 00:51:20,727
what would be between the sun and the moon?

593
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:22,567
I don't know.

594
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:24,167
What is this?

595
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:26,107
It's scary.

596
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:31,607
Just go see Yoo Beom Ryong.

597
00:51:31,607 --> 00:51:34,587
It's something you should experience at least once.

598
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:38,097
All right.

599
00:51:41,407 --> 00:51:44,947
But don't hang out with anyone who writes that kind of story.

600
00:51:48,277 --> 00:51:49,737
I don't like it.

601
00:51:49,737 --> 00:51:52,147
How do you know I didn't write it?

602
00:51:52,147 --> 00:51:53,727
Are you an idiot?

603
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,377
If you wrote it, you'd know what it means.

604
00:51:56,377 --> 00:51:58,177
Whoever wrote it would know.

605
00:51:58,177 --> 00:52:01,477
Since they chose each word carefully.

606
00:52:04,617 --> 00:52:06,757
I'll be back.

607
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:23,267
There's no way she would know what was written 30 years later.

608
00:53:26,977 --> 00:53:28,867
 Hae Joon!

609
00:53:28,867 --> 00:53:30,527
 Hae Joon!

610
00:53:30,527 --> 00:53:32,747
 Hey, Hae Joon!

611
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:04,378

612
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:09,778

613
00:55:03,577 --> 00:55:06,177
I heard the Korean language teacher got hurt...

614
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:10,947
Let me know if you need any help.

615
00:55:10,947 --> 00:55:15,127
I like what you've done so far.

616
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:20,507
So, you liked what happened to Go Min Soo.

617
00:55:27,777 --> 00:55:31,657
A man stood between the sun and the moon vacantly.

618
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:40,147
If there's a sentence like that,

619
00:55:40,147 --> 00:55:43,417
what could "between the sun and moon" mean?

620
00:55:49,787 --> 00:55:52,117
How would I know?

621
00:55:59,307 --> 00:56:01,757
I shouldn't have asked.

622
00:56:02,917 --> 00:56:05,557
Isn't that the name of the record store?

623
00:56:09,928 --> 00:56:13,268

624
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,247

625
00:56:20,147 --> 00:56:22,487

626
00:56:23,497 --> 00:56:26,898

627
00:56:38,907 --> 00:56:45,198

628
00:57:08,477 --> 00:57:14,018

629
00:57:54,327 --> 00:57:57,417
Do you know what time it is right now?

630
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:07,577
Then, do you know what it feels like waiting for someone who skipped school?

631
00:58:08,517 --> 00:58:13,317
I can't even make phone calls in this damn year of 1987.

632
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:21,597
I'm sorry.

633
00:58:23,107 --> 00:58:28,047
I knew I had to tell you, but I decided on my own and kept it to myself.

634
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:31,837
But that's not why I sent you to her house last night.

635
00:58:32,657 --> 00:58:34,437
I know.

636
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:39,407
The one with the blue cap is your—

637
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:41,507
I know that, too.

638
00:58:43,927 --> 00:58:46,917
I saw him myself.

639
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:51,627
I think I understand why you kept it from me.

640
00:58:52,807 --> 00:58:54,967
Because he's my family.

641
00:58:56,387 --> 00:58:59,377
He's just one of the suspects.

642
00:59:03,547 --> 00:59:06,187
I did hate him, but...

643
00:59:06,187 --> 00:59:10,147
I didn't ever think he was that kind of person.

644
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:14,587
He's someone my dad thinks of dearly.

645
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:18,467
Even more than us.

646
00:59:20,917 --> 00:59:22,757
What did you say?

647
00:59:24,497 --> 00:59:26,147
Excuse me?

648
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:31,497
Who are you talking about right now?

649
00:59:31,497 --> 00:59:34,127
Weren't you talking about the one with the blue cap?

650
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:35,837
Yes, that's right.

651
00:59:35,837 --> 00:59:40,427
So why would Baek Hee Seop think so dearly of himself...

652
00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:46,727
Are you saying the one with the blue cap is my dad?

653
00:59:50,117 --> 00:59:52,707
Who did you see, then?

654
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:58,278

655
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,498

656
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,837
I saw my uncle, my dad's older brother.

657
01:00:29,837 --> 01:00:32,177
Baek Yoo Seop.

658
01:00:32,177 --> 01:00:34,897
Baek Yoo Seop wasn't even a suspect at the time.

659
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:38,087
And he wasn't even in the vicinity last night...

660
01:00:53,097 --> 01:00:55,817
Now it makes sense.

661
01:01:09,637 --> 01:01:12,237

662
01:01:12,237 --> 01:01:15,397

663
01:01:15,397 --> 01:01:17,147
Brother!

664
01:01:17,847 --> 01:01:20,317
What are you doing here? It's not even the weekend.

665
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:23,667
I was supposed to meet someone but looks like they didn't come. You?

666
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:25,897
I'm just meeting someone.

667
01:01:25,897 --> 01:01:28,827
- Shall we go inside and talk? 
 - No, it's stuffy in there.

668
01:01:28,827 --> 01:01:31,217
If you won't be long, I'll wait in front.

669
01:01:31,217 --> 01:01:32,407
Oh, really?

670
01:01:32,407 --> 01:01:35,027
That would be great!

671
01:01:37,577 --> 01:01:40,567
Wow, it looks cool, Brother.

672
01:01:49,657 --> 01:01:52,107
Here.

673
01:01:52,107 --> 01:01:53,477
Let's see.

674
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:55,657
Looking good!

675
01:01:55,657 --> 01:01:58,987
It suits me, right?

676
01:01:58,987 --> 01:02:01,887
- Don't take too long! 
 - Okay, Brother.

677
01:02:07,368 --> 01:02:14,358

678
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:35,167
♫  I found the meaning of life  ♫

679
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:38,047
♫  Come to me, darling  ♫

680
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:43,657
♫  If there's anything you want, I'll give it all to you  ♫

681
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:48,887
♫  If you have any doubts, just rest your worries  ♫

682
01:02:48,887 --> 01:02:50,777
♫  I'll lead you only down the flower path  ♫

683
01:02:50,777 --> 01:02:52,637

684
01:02:52,637 --> 01:02:54,627
 There's nothing here about Baek Yoo Seop.

685
01:02:54,627 --> 01:02:56,557
 Not one piece of info on him is in all these documents.

686
01:02:56,557 --> 01:02:58,897
 No one knows Baek Yoo Seop better than I do.

687
01:02:58,897 --> 01:03:00,907
 I'll fill you in on everything you need to know about him.

688
01:03:00,907 --> 01:03:04,467
 If Baek Yoo Seop really is the culprit, we will see him tomorrow.

689
01:03:04,467 --> 01:03:06,827
 Since he will have to kill the second victim.

690
01:03:06,827 --> 01:03:08,647
 Where and what do you think he's doing?

691
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:11,010
 - We looked everywhere... 
 - No, it can't be yet.

692
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:12,428
 Hello.

693
01:03:12,428 --> 01:03:17,188
♫  I hope it becomes a fateful moment  ♫
