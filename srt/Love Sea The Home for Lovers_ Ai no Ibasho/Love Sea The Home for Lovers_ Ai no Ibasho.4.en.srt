1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,650
Put the sign there.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,730
Got it.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,000
(SDGs Symposium, Co-creating the Future Oceans and Islands)

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,590
Is it okay?

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,600
Yeah.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,270
(Ai-san, eat breakfast properly)

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,400
(Where do you like to go after I finish the symposium prep?)

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,800
(Ai-san, have you had lunch yet?)

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,460
How boring.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,460
Love is just delusion.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,200
Really just thinking about work?

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,200
Hello.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,570
Kaishin, thanks for your efforts.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,780
By the way.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,350
Take this.

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,400
Okay.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,050
Thanks.

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,880
Last year's talk on ocean conservation was really great.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,220
We're counting on you again tomorrow.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,560
This year will be livestreamed.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,460
If we can get people off-island interested...

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,350
that'd be nice.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,200
Looking forward to it.

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,680
By the way, how's your cat?

25
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:17,830
Huh?

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,630
You're taking care of one, right?

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,440
Ah.

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,140
Oh, my.

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,120
I haven't seen him today.

30
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,050
That's really worrying.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,410
When cats are scared or not feeling well

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,930
they hide to protect themselves.

33
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,980
Hope he's okay.

34
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,600
I should go check on him.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
Go ahead.

36
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,290
- Thank you.
- Yes.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,100
Ai-san.

38
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,560
It's Kaishin.

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,700
Are you writing?

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,430
Or are you sleeping?

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,430
I'm coming in.

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,070
Here

43
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,110
I brought this for you.

44
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,160
Ai-san.

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,890
Are you okay?

46
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,690
Ai-san.

47
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,960
Ai-san!

48
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,470
Sorry to disturb you.

49
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,970
But at your feet...

50
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,890
I'll clean it up, don't move.

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,110
You haven't eaten anything today, have you?

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,000
None of your business.

53
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,250
Ai-san.

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
What are you so afraid of?

55
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,160
When you were focused on writing,

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,980
I knew I couldn't disturb you,

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,920
but it wasn't like this.

58
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,300
Even when you were struggling, you looked happy.

59
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,270
Shut up!

60
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,850
You don't know anything.

61
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,750
You're just a dog I pay to keep around. Don't get confused.

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Love Sea: The Home for Lovers
(Episode 4)

63
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,990
I'm not scared at all.

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,810
That's what I kept telling myself

65
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,490
I've been running away.

66
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,870
Please tell me the truth.

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,720
Your fiancée or me?

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,800
Even if it deeply hurts one of us.

69
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,050
- Cut! No problem.
- Okay.

70
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,440
Very good.

71
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,580
This scene is done, please change costumes.

72
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,660
We're changing the set.

73
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,700
Um...

74
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,360
Where's Himeka Ui...?

75
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,010
She's over there.

76
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,390
Fumi.

77
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,500
Over here.

78
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,750
Huh?

79
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,510
You're earlier than I expected.

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,900
Wait.

81
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,690
What's this about?

82
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,880
Sit down first.

83
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,150
Is this okay?

84
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,670
30 denier stockings.

85
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,690
You're a big help, thank you.

86
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,590
Well, I'll be on my way.

87
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,690
Fumi.

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,040
Just a little longer.

89
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,340
My work here is done, I'm going home.

90
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,430
What do you mean?

91
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,380
Time to execute the operation.

92
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,710
Huh?

93
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,270
Baby mission.

94
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,730
Seriously?

95
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:52,830
Totally.

96
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,020
Cab you call yourself a writer's secretary?

97
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,640
You need to read the room.

98
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,410
I got the leading role through sexual favors.

99
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,360
Actress H being criticized.

100
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,210
And Fumi is...

101
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,030
the true love secretly supporting actress H

102
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,150
to save her from crisis

103
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,470
starts showing up on set.

104
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,010
No, wait a minute.

105
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,120
This is too crazy

106
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,530
I think it's a good.

107
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,920
I already said no to the fake couple thing.

108
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,780
You agreed back then.

109
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,990
No, I refused.

110
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,420
Is that so.

111
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,100
But...

112
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,100
Huh?

113
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,370
Might be too late.

114
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,040
How did this happen?

115
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,650
Ai-san, let's go.

116
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,350
What?

117
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,690
As you said.

118
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,330
I don't know anything.

119
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,770
How utterly hopeless you are...

120
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,570
Spoiled, fickle, selfish... that's all I know.

121
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,850
Are you picking a fight?

122
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,240
No.

123
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,120
- But please forgive my selfishness, too.
- What are you doing!

124
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,980
Hey!

125
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,040
Let go.

126
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,330
No.

127
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,150
Get on.

128
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,090
What?

129
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,080
Stop getting in my way.

130
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,380
Am I the one getting in your way?

131
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,300
Let's go change mood.

132
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,390
There's something I want to show you.

133
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,110
I don't want to go.

134
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,520
Don't you understand human language?

135
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,380
Want to play a staring game?

136
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,770
Dogs are loyal and patient.

137
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,580
I'll let you work when we get back.

138
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,840
I promise.

139
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,620
Finally.

140
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,380
Hold on tight.

141
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,260
Hey.

142
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,690
Where are you taking me?

143
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,910
Almost there.

144
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,050
This is it.

145
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,460
Sit down.

146
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,190
Come on.

147
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
I'm not going to hurt you.

148
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,840
Trust me once.

149
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,010
Hey.

150
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,950
Trust me now?

151
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,850
I've never seen...

152
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,200
the starry sky.

153
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,120
You look handsome when you smile.

154
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,590
Tired of hearing that.

155
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,010
Give me a break.

156
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,430
That's the only word with my limited knowledge.

157
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,410
Read more books.

158
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,460
Your smile is cute.

159
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,830
Which is it?

160
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,280
Handsome and stylish.

161
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,920
Cute and beautiful.

162
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,310
- It increased.
- Haha.

163
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,280
Sorry...

164
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,700
for calling you a dog.

165
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,200
Why apologize?

166
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,670
Woof, woof, woof.

167
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,990
I'm your dog.

168
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,800
Woof, woof, woof.

169
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,820
Really.

170
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,750
First time I've seen a sky like this.

171
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,110
When I was little.

172
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,060
I always envied friends

173
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
who have those memories

174
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,600
went stargazing, to the beach

175
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,120
with the whole family went camping.

176
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,720
My mom...

177
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,380
bought my father with money.

178
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,640
But he spent all of her money.

179
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,890
Even so...

180
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,320
she was still obsessed with him.

181
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,470
My mom named my sister...

182
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,810
Koi (indulgence)

183
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,270
When I was born

184
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,430
the situation was worse.

185
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,130
Everyone says my name is beautiful.

186
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,690
But the truth is

187
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,050
it was mom's tragic plea for dad's love.

188
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,270
Sorry to be such a downer.

189
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,680
Don't laugh.

190
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,500
Not handsome anymore?

191
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,750
Ai-san once said

192
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,280
love...

193
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,890
is just delusion.

194
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,440
Yes.

195
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,230
Fiction created in the mind.

196
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,890
Want to try it?

197
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,190
What?

198
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,840
Just for the time on this island.

199
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,550
I am the one who bring you the delusion

200
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,110
do you want me to buy you?

201
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,440
I don't have that kind of courage.

202
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,680
How much?

203
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,410
Whatever you want.

204
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,600
You decide.

205
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,460
Hey.

206
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,360
No, stop it.

207
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,700
Let me go.

208
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,910
My butt's gonna get wet!

209
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,490
The sea is supposed to be wet.

210
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,880
It's fine, isn't it?

211
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,440
Night swimming

212
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,090
I don't want to.

213
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,410
Let go.

214
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,410
Really?

215
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,350
Don't let go.

216
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,910
Hey!

217
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,270
What a difficult person.

218
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,830
You're having fun, aren't you?

219
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,990
This is fun.

220
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,670
It's fun teasing Ai-san.

221
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,910
Geez.

222
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,540
I get it

223
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,680
I'll put you down.

224
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,020
Liar!

225
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,800
I got water in my eyes.

226
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,650
Don't laugh.

227
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,130
I'm soaked.

228
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,600
Me, too.

229
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,950
The sea at night...

230
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,250
Do you like it?

231
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,290
Are you planning to make only me talk while you say nothing?

232
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,350
I'll kiss you if you don't speak.

233
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,630
I want to kiss you.

234
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,620
Ah~.

235
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,890
Were you a dog in a past life?

236
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:24,860
Woof.

237
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,100
Always biting and barking.

238
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,630
And want to monopolize the owner.

239
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,340
Go to sleep

240
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,070
I'll hold you tight.

241
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,100
Who asked you to?

242
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,400
Is it urgent work?

243
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,820
No.

244
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,130
My publisher already agreed to not have a deadline.

245
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,210
Then sleep.

246
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,670
It's fine.

247
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,480
You go ahead and sleep.

248
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,780
Sleep before my owner?

249
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,760
I still have work to do.

250
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,300
I'm not sleepy either.

251
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,050
Go to sleep.

252
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,610
Why do you want me to sleep?

253
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,600
You dummy

254
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,000
I can't work with you staring at me

255
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,540
I'll be quiet.

256
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,820
I won't bother you.

257
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,620
If you're not going to sleep, go home.

258
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,870
Fine.

259
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,590
Good night.

260
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,170
A melting candle.

261
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,860
The gentle sound of the waves.

262
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,060
Leading the two toward the end of that dream.

263
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,460
Are you asleep?

264
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,460
Kaishin.

265
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,090
I'm still awake.

266
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,080
Sleep.

267
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,550
I don't want to sleep yet.

268
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,960
Only act spoiled after I fall asleep.

269
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,490
It's hot.

270
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,720
I turned down the temperature.

271
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,090
This is just right.

272
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,620
Remember all of this.

273
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,930
Make sure you take it back with you.

274
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,900
What?

275
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,940
Memories from the island and such.

276
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,010
Like the warmth of these arms.

277
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,040
City nights

278
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,040
are much colder than here.

279
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,500
When you think of me, Ai-san...

280
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,850
the memory of me

281
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,360
can warm you up.

282
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,270
So let me

283
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,680
stay like this for a little longer.

284
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,480
Hello?

285
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,050
You're up so early.

286
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,830
Today is a bit...

287
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,520
I'm going to shoot now.

288
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,600
Hey.

289
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,100
Don't tell me you already went for treatments?

290
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,980
Island resort spa or something.

291
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,630
Of course not.

292
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:46,810
Why do you ask?

293
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,720
Somehow...

294
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,120
your skin looks radiant.

295
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,230
Are you spying on me from somewhere?

296
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,440
So nice.

297
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,310
Same old here.

298
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,000
Hmm?

299
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,970
That rumor?

300
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,270
I'll crush that kind of thing with talent.

301
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,900
That's so you.

302
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,630
What else?

303
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,380
That's...

304
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,670
Geez.

305
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,170
Your Royal Highness.

306
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,500
Not bad, huh?

307
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,890
A real lover

308
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,960
with 15 years of creative power of the writer's best friends.

309
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,140
Have you always been into women?

310
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,270
Hmm?

311
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,780
So, what's this operation?

312
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,140
Baby mission.

313
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,250
Hey.

314
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,400
Will you help me?

315
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,680
You'll make me do it no matter what.

316
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,700
You know me so well.

317
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,350
In exchange...

318
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,150
Only until the rumors die down.

319
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,540
You don't want them to say you're bisexual, right?

320
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,450
I'm not bisexual.

321
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,320
Right?

322
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,450
So what then.

323
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,210
What do you want me to do?

324
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,950
Hover around constantly.

325
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,240
Pick me up at 5 a.m.

326
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,360
Five... 5 a.m.!?

327
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,930
Speak of the devil.

328
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,520
Good morning.

329
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,780
Good morning, Fumi.

330
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,440
Yes.

331
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,000
Ai is up, too.

332
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:36,870
Huh?

333
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,420
Teacher.

334
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,650
Were you also woken up early by Himeka-san?

335
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,460
Wait a minute.

336
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,290
This morning just happened to be early.

337
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,820
I'm heading out now.

338
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,360
Islands really change people's lifestyles.

339
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,400
But...

340
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,340
from tomorrow it'll return to normal, right?

341
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:01,860
Huh?

342
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,410
You're coming back tomorrow, aren't you?

343
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,060
Ah, thank goodness.

344
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,540
This week felt really long.

345
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,870
What do you mean?

346
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,140
Just what I said.

347
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,100
Well then, Teacher.

348
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,620
Hm?

349
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,020
I'll clean your house tomorrow.

350
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,570
Waiting for you to get back.

351
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,870
Please be very careful.

352
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,120
Don't just bring back fun stories

353
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,440
bring back souvenirs, too.

354
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,150
How nice.

355
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,480
Me, too.

356
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,300
Tomorrow's the last day.

357
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,160
Ai-san, let's go.

358
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,480
Hey

359
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,870
I got water in my ear this time.

360
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,900
Let me dry it for you.

361
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,230
It tickles.

362
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,030
Geez.

363
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,720
Take this
