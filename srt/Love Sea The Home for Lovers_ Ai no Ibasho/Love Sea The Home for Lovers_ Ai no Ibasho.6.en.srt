1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,680
Whoa, so impressive.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,770
The ceilings is so high.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,350
My secretary, Fumi

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,450
and my friend Himeka, why are you here?

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,600
Hello.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,380
I came to welcome my friend back.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,880
Ever the thoughtful one, Himeka.

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,440
I'm Kaishin.

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,570
Where is Ai-san's room?

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,000
On the second floor.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,580
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,400
What are you doing?

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Nothing. Just going to his room.

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,470
No entry for outsiders.

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,280
Let him in.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,930
Teacher.

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,530
Even I'm not allowed in there.

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,450
How can you... let him in?!

19
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,430
Because...

20
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,830
if he can't enter the room

21
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,360
where are we supposed to have sex?

22
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,720
Have...

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,830
Already bought him, gotta get my money's worth.

24
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,230
You have a point.

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,010
Or would you like to check here if I'm worth the price?

26
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,630
So crude...

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,670
Ai

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,810
is

29
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,430
like a dad!

30
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,710
Wait.
What.

31
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:03,950
Wait.

32
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,160
Tomorrow

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,190
don't we have a contract meeting early morning?

34
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,830
Alright.

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,370
Go back home quickly.

36
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,750
You too, Himeka.

37
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,840
Okay.

38
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,230
I haven't finished talking.

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,440
I don't know why you trust him

40
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,630
but this suspicious guy

41
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,230
who knows what he's hiding!

42
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,590
Now that you mention it...

43
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,680
Right?

44
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,200
Tomorrow.

45
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,960
Let's get him checked out at the hospital.

46
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,010
Fumi.

47
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,280
Schedule a full checkup for him with my family doctor.

48
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,160
Oh, and...
STD test, too.

49
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,610
Why me?

50
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,950
Who am I?

51
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,000
The boss.

52
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,210
Good night.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,700
Let's go.

54
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,120
You can leave the bag here.

55
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,600
You're sleeping in the guest room downstairs.

56
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,080
Huh?

57
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,460
I'm...

58
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,790
not letting you into my bed.

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,800
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 6)

60
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,810
Big brother is so cruel, abandoning me.

61
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,400
You heartless guy

62
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,150
I'll wire you the money.

63
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,310
Huh?

64
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,880
You're the best, man!

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,850
Only a bunch of alcohol.

66
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,210
By the way

67
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,340
when are you coming back?

68
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,430
Haven't decided. All I know is I'm going to the hospital today.

69
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you sick?

70
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,480
No, it's not like that.

71
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,630
There's a sleepy cat

72
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,030
and a paranoid mouse.

73
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,960
Well then

74
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,370
please sign here.

75
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,090
Thank you very much.

76
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,350
Alright

77
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,070
we will proceed with the rest of the paperwork.

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,260
Okay

79
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,050
I'll leave it in your hands.

80
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,550
Thank you for your help.

81
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,600
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

82
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,300
Thank you.

83
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,950
We're entrusting this to you.
Thank you for your hard work.

84
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,440
They promised to strengthen patrols during school hours.

85
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,220
Sorry for making you worry.

86
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,650
Teacher.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,450
Teacher Ai.

88
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,540
Can you please reconsider?

89
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
Huh? The contract we just signed?

90
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,220
No

91
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,840
I'm talking about that man.

92
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,970
Buying a man is utterly ridiculous.

93
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,660
If this gets out online,
your popular writer career is ruined.

94
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,180
I don't do returns.

95
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,790
You seriously want to spend your future with him?

96
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,690
Of course not!

97
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,570
But...

98
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,540
this is what I decided.

99
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,830
In that case, I've got an idea.

100
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,640
Hmm?

101
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,530
Today's test results are on the table.

102
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,520
Looks like it's okay even if we run out of condoms.

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,570
Shut up!

104
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,940
And what are you cooking,
acting like this is totally normal?

105
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,420
If you eat raw pork, all those tests would be wasted.

106
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,470
I told you not to cook

107
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,680
order takeout...!

108
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,570
It's cheaper to cook it on our own.

109
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,060
Teacher Ai doesn't eat food like this.

110
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,340
Why not?

111
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,660
Does he drink gasoline or something?

112
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,500
Maybe.

113
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,190
What is he, a monster?

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
I have no idea what you're talking about.

115
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,550
Huh?

116
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,980
Ai-san is incredible.

117
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,420
He's someone who drinks gasoline.

118
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,550
Please don't say that with respect.

119
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,850
Yes.

120
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,130
Please ask if anything is unclear.

121
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,260
This is...

122
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,040
A cohabitation agreement.

123
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,080
If there's anything you disagree with or lacks,
please tell me.

124
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,130
It mainly outlines the obligations for both of you.

125
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,140
Teacher will pay for living expenses.

126
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,800
And you can't do things the teacher dislikes.

127
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,960
Party A reserves the right of termination.

128
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,070
Meaning if Ai-san gets tired of me,
he can just kick me out whenever?

129
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,470
Precisely.

130
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,970
What if I refuse?

131
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,590
That's not an option.

132
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,870
This is non-negotiable.

133
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,820
Name your conditions.

134
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,480
If you want to study, he'll send you.
He'll support anything you want to do.

135
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,200
However...

136
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,060
non-negotiable terms must be followed.

137
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,660
Especially...

138
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,730
the prohibition of romance.

139
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,210
I agree.

140
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,360
Then let's continue.

141
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,590
Payment will be made monthly.

142
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,650
Food, accommodation, and other necessary
expenses will be covered separately.

143
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,370
Do writers make that much money?

144
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,580
Besides novels

145
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,180
there are other income sources.

146
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,390
And...

147
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,660
my family was rich originally.

148
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,530
So...

149
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,010
how much do you want?

150
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,760
Whatever you decide

151
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,130
I'll let Ai-san decide.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,840
Then the agreement is done.

153
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,370
Is it good?

154
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,550
Delicious.

155
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,950
Now officially a sugar daddy on paper.

156
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,660
So you approve.

157
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,300
I do not approve.

158
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,470
This is a temporary arrangement.

159
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,430
Ai-san is my sugar daddy?

160
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,300
Hmm?
Isn't he?

161
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,350
I'm the kitten's daddy.

162
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,520
Well, Ai has good taste.

163
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
What's good about it?

164
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,810
Huh?

165
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,130
Upset that your beloved teacher was taken away?

166
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,750
- I didn't mean that.
- Well, it can't be helped.

167
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,630
Women don't have "that thing".

168
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,110
Exactly.

169
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,870
Though I love Fumi

170
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,710
since she doesn't have "that thing".

171
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,770
I can't love her in that way.

172
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,930
You're both the same.

173
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,440
Birds of a feather.

174
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,740
Thick as thieves.

175
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,170
So, in other words...

176
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,430
I have "that thing," you love me.

177
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,700
How wonderful.

178
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,610
It's easier to love someone than to abandon them.

179
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,180
Well?

180
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,240
So boring.

181
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,790
Just one thing...

182
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,700
I want to buy spare clothes.

183
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,900
Where's a good store?

184
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,760
Fumi.

185
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,610
Go buy some for him tomorrow.

186
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,270
Me?

187
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,020
Food, clothing, and housing guarantee.

188
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,130
Isn't that in the contract?

189
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,520
Or...
You want me to go?

190
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,950
Well then.

191
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,770
Sorry, please get me some underwear, too.

192
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,770
Underwear!
You heard.

193
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,450
Underwear.
Underwear!

194
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,200
Why...

195
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,280
is it me?

196
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,710
Environmental protection is in your hands, go for it.

197
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,190
Thanks for dropping me off.

198
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,620
I signed it.

199
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,040
So now, I'm all yours, Ai-san.

200
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,420
Also...

201
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,460
About the terms.

202
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,420
Anything else you want to add?

203
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,600
No.

204
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,930
About the prohibition of romance...

205
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,850
It means exactly what it says.

206
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,210
I have no interest in those romantic fantasies...

207
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,670
and think they're a waste of time.

208
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,780
Between us...

209
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,850
there will only be sex, that's the contract.

210
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,300
You don't believe in love.

211
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,680
I'm so sick of hearing that.

212
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,630
But some things can't be bound by written words.

213
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,220
You can't stop me from loving you.

214
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,260
I could never love you.

215
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,480
Kissing isn't prohibited.

216
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,250
Right?

217
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,500
You are forbidden from doing anything I dislike.

218
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,590
I like it.

219
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,890
Call me anytime

220
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,670
I will be at your service.

221
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,210
What just happened...

222
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,030
Think it over.

223
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't command me.

224
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,490
I will guide you.

225
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,240
Understand..

226
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,520
New book...

227
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,700
Urban.

228
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,640
What is love...

229
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,990
Love is too boring.

230
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,460
You're too conspicuous.

231
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,740
Radiating star aura

232
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,310
I'm not hiding.

233
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,220
It's your day off, you don't have to be with me.

234
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,340
Even on vacation I get photographed

235
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,850
I don't really have holidays.

236
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,180
Since I'll be photographed anyway...

237
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,250
might as well use "Crazy for New Love" as the headline.

238
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,490
Shirts and...

239
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,850
pants...

240
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,720
buy ten sets each for replacement...

241
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,810
planning to wear them to the next life?

242
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,680
Who knows...

243
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,460
Teacher Ai...

244
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,710
did he fall into that person's trap?

245
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,020
I wouldn't call it a trap...

246
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,260
he might have fallen in love.

247
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,960
What?

248
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,170
What's there to worry about?

249
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,490
I'm worried.

250
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,430
Shouldn't you be more excited?

251
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,130
Ai Rakumoto...

252
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,650
maybe he can get rid of the destructive writing style.

253
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,620
This might be his last chance.

254
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,800
Let's go.

255
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,560
- Let's get something to eat first.
- Okay.

256
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,490
What do you want?

257
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,600
You're awake.

258
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,920
Don't barge in without permission

259
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,050
I knocked, and I'm hungry.

260
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,760
- You can order delivery.
- My phone's dead.

261
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,770
Let's go out to eat.

262
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,000
- I have no appetite.
- The contract guarantees my food, clothing, housing.

263
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,940
I'm really starving.

264
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,020
You said it yourself, didn't you?

265
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,300
That you'd do anything Kaishin asks.

266
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,980
I want to eat with you, Ai-san.

267
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,250
Please.

268
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,770
Quiet water...

269
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,600
Spring water...

270
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,760
What can I get for you?

271
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,300
The assorted stew...

272
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,930
I'll have clear broth mountain vegetables sweetfish,
fried bamboo fish balls, and miso grilled duck.

273
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,180
How about you?

274
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,420
You can just order for me, Ai-san.

275
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,450
Anything is fine.

276
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,060
Alright then...

277
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,340
fresh tofu skin, fan-shaped turnip tempura,
Hida beef and spring water pork loin.

278
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,040
And two cold-brewed green teas.

279
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,770
Yes, right away.

280
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,590
We can share, if you like.

281
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,320
Sounded like a spell.

282
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,600
Sorry for embarrassing you.

283
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,940
Who made you think that?

284
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,700
Was it the waiter just now?

285
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,870
Where are you going?

286
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,380
I'll talk to him.

287
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,540
Why?

288
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,400
Because I'm pissed.

289
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,790
You're a customer here...

290
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,590
everyone has a first time...

291
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,610
no reason to be looked down on.

292
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,030
What are you smiling about?

293
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,710
I'm just happy.

294
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,530
If you didn't care about me, you wouldn't be angry.

295
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,560
Of course.

296
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,220
Since returning to the city,
you only stay home working.

297
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,630
You didn't even eat the food I cooked.

298
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,040
I was actually really hurt.

299
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,740
You're not that fragile

300
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,140
I'm not fragile.

301
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,770
But I have a soft spot for the person I like.

302
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,560
I don't like you.

303
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,360
You don't like me... yet.

304
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,410
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,380
I try not to eat when writing.

306
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,720
It breaks my concentration.

307
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,930
Replacing meals with snacks is bad for health.

308
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,520
That's my lifestyle.

309
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,770
I'll take care of you.

310
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,780
Don't turn all your earnings into medical bills.

311
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,270
Making money to see doctors, taking medicine as meals.

312
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,400
I won't let that happen to you.

313
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,180
Okay, enough preaching.

314
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,940
After all, we're on a date.

315
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,690
Huh?

316
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,000
We're just eating out.

317
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,060
In Ai-san's novel I read last night

318
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
the main character called eat out a date.

319
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,360
And then they kissed.

320
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,910
So...

321
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,760
don't we need to kiss to that extent?

322
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,110
If this were a novel now...

323
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,160
you'd hear a sizzle sound...

324
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,370
even his ears turn red.

325
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,150
Right?

326
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,270
Get away from me.

327
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,380
Why?

328
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,620
Fine, I get it.

329
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,150
- You bought a lot of pants.
- Sure did.

330
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,780
The hamburger steak was delicious, too.

331
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,690
So good, I ordered another one.

332
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,460
Wonder if Teacher Ai is home

333
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,740
I'll call and ask.

334
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,240
Fumi, even if you don't look after him so much...

335
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,490
someone else will take care of him, okay?

336
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,910
Someone else?

337
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,050
His boyfriend.

338
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,250
No way.

339
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,600
That guy...

340
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,240
He said he hasn't even read teacher's novels.

341
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,730
So I lent him one.

342
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,990
Which one did you lend him?

343
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,650
The one that got an adaptation last year.
Himeka-san was in it, too.

344
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,020
Ah.

345
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,480
The main character is a selfish waste

346
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,820
who buys men with money.

347
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,070
When I read the manuscript, I told teacher

348
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,820
that he definitely needs punishment.

349
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,060
And what happened?

350
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,100
"I already finished writing."

351
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,590
"Too lazy to change it."

352
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,100
"Take your revenge in your head."

353
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,410
He completely destroys readers' fantasies.

354
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,630
Fumi, you really...

355
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,520
love Ai's novels.

356
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,460
That's because...

357
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,460
they changed my life.

358
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,170
Having a fan like you nearby.

359
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,190
Ai is very fortunate.

360
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,550
Fans staying nearby...

361
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,920
isn't that creepy?

362
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,200
Not really.

363
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,190
Although...

364
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,030
being too close is troublesome.

365
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,060
It is a fan and celebrity relationship after all.

366
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,000
I forgot about an online meeting

367
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,690
I'll excuse myself.

368
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,610
Fumi?

369
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,240
How about this one?

370
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:21,860
This one?

371
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:27,960
And this one.
Okay.

372
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,290
Also...

373
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:34,980
Mmm.

374
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,650
Buying them for yourself is one thing...

375
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,900
but these are for me, right?

376
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,210
Right

377
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,910
I won't let anyone look down on you again.

378
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,920
Get his measurements.

379
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,540
What?

380
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,970
Kaishin.

381
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,340
- Even if locked up I'd buy.
- Because you're my sugar daddy?

382
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,940
Too pitiful without designer brands to transform me?

383
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,860
I don't think that way.

384
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,780
If Ai-san thinks I'm pathetic, then I am pathetic.

385
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,320
I only care about what the people who matter say.

386
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,950
Being looked down on by others doesn't matter.

387
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,180
I...

388
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,530
don't think so.

389
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,130
This is a fitting room.

390
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,870
People outside will think we're just trying things on inside.

391
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,930
Just like in a novel.

392
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,090
You're too into character.

393
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,760
Does it fit?

394
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,280
It fits

395
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,200
I'll be right out.

396
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,350
You bought too much.

397
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,960
I'm not looking down on you.

398
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,240
And I'm not pitying you.

399
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,350
And don't plan to make you obey with money.

400
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,400
This is just a returning

401
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,670
returning?

402
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,130
Unbelievable.

403
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,060
There's a celebrity over there!

404
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
You're in the way.

405
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,830
Don't touch me

406
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm pouring coffee.

407
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,650
Go over there.

408
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,830
What's wrong.

409
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,790
I'm sorry about earlier.

410
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,620
Look...

411
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,390
Anyone would be angry, right?

412
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,810
If their bought man flirted with others...

413
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,910
I'll get the coffee

414
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,090
I'll stay outside after this.

415
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,880
I'm annoying, right?

416
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,010
Where are you going?

417
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,800
I...

418
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,230
Are you abandoning me?

419
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,820
We...

420
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,120
Finish what you were saying.

421
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,910
Let's make up.

422
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,180
Huh?

423
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,450
No one's here.

424
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,550
Brother~.

425
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,360
What are you doing here?

426
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,290
Same as always, ignoring me.

427
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,090
Look over here.

428
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,960
Long time no see.
Brother~.

429
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,420
I only have one older sister.

430
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,330
Everyone else is a stranger.

431
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,990
Hey, do normal people consider cousins strangers?

432
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,940
Good evening, I'm Rin.

433
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,060
Ah...

434
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,060
You're brother's current sex buddy?

435
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,790
Pretty rustic looking though.

436
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,960
Don't you have anything to do?

437
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,420
Going around announcing your stupidity.

438
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,370
Seems you're free.

439
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,070
Well... I'm just worried about you.

440
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,270
Worried?

441
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,450
Our only sister's divorce was bad enough.

442
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,570
You doing this will shame our family, right?

443
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,010
How's your lover doing?

444
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,430
Huh?

445
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,320
- Don't change the subject.
- This is a family matter, too.

446
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,230
When you invested in his business...

447
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,850
Ah! Just shut up!

448
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,190
I'm telling Mom you insulted me

449
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,780
I didn't insult you...

450
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,140
People in our family...

451
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,370
all live by depending on men.

452
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,880
I'm different.

453
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,980
I don't buy men with money.

454
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,420
I'm just lending him money.

455
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,370
Yeah, right.

456
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,080
Ai-san.

457
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,250
Just leave me alone.

458
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,830
But...

459
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,360
You haven't told me what you want to eat yet.

460
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,030
Since we're buying underwear anyway...

461
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,080
let's pick one that will make Ai laugh.

462
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,500
It's not like we're buying underwear for teacher.

463
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,520
But...

464
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,990
Ai's the one who'll be taking them off, right?

465
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,050
Fumi.

466
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,110
You're so cute.

467
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,940
You really love to tease people.

468
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,720
Should we go buy lingerie, too?

469
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,410
No way.

470
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,960
Hey, come on.

471
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,000
- Please, it would suit you.
- No way.

472
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,360
I think red would be better

473
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,960
I didn't ask you.

474
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,140
Lace would suit you.

475
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,880
Lace...

476
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,740
Lace or those fitted styles...

477
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,890
You know

478
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,100
cute styles?

479
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,540
- No way...
- Why not? Please!
