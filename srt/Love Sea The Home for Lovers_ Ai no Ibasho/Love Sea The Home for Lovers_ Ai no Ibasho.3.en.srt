1
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,030
The rain's stopped.

2
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,050
Go home.

3
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,100
Huh?

4
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,620
You're done, right?

5
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,950
Toss the condom on your way out.

6
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,530
Lock the door when you leave.

7
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,450
What about a goodbye hug?

8
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,080
- Let me wash your back.
- Go back.

9
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,320
Fine, fine.

10
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,260
See you tomorrow.

11
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,110
That was great.

12
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,920
Eh, big brother, rare to see you at this hour.

13
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:41,990
And...

14
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,420
coming back from the inn, too.

15
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,680
Could it be...

16
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,250
with that handsome guest?

17
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,040
You're the one who treats people like local products.

18
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,560
Thanks to the promotion.

19
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,820
Idiot, mind your own business

20
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,800
I ask you to promote the diving tours

21
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,320
not me.

22
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,580
But he ended up falling for you So I win the bet.

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,660
Bet?
Yep.

24
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,710
That novelist.

25
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,760
Seems to come from a rich family, a second generation.

26
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,240
Everyone was betting on who could get him first.

27
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,190
How vulgar.

28
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,860
Hmm

29
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,590
I bet on you, won completely.

30
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,360
Not necessarily.

31
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,950
Huh?

32
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,340
But...

33
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,660
you were in his room just now, weren't you?

34
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,880
But I didn't stay the night, did I?

35
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,330
True.

36
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,780
Why not?

37
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,570
What he wants from me...

38
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,570
is just that level of work.

39
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,950
That's all.

40
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,370
To my scratched hand

41
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,630
as if comforting.

42
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,740
Gently kissing.

43
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,720
Instinctively.

44
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:18,300
Love Sea: The Home for Lovers
(Episode 3)

45
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,340
No, it's true!

46
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,270
Don't you believe me?

47
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,790
Really cute

48
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,380
I'm sure you all will meet someone great, too.

49
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,040
Right?

50
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,030
No, I'm dying to show you

51
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,250
20,000?

52
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,410
I don't like sharing with others.

53
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,060
Hello.

54
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,240
Excuse me.

55
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,510
He's mine.

56
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,120
Ai-san.

57
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,940
I'm not jealous.

58
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,520
You can sleep with whoever, date whoever you want.

59
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,280
But since I paid money

60
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,950
you are mine.

61
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,230
So...

62
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,990
let's get back the money you spent.

63
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,960
Why is that bartender here?

64
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,090
Diving needs manpower, assistant and operator.

65
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,600
Besides bar work,
we work together during peak season.

66
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,340
Or do you want to do something else and find him in the way?

67
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,100
Just let me dive quickly.

68
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,380
Okay, please wait a moment.

69
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,610
Ham

70
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,280
I'm going down for an hour.

71
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,160
Got it.

72
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,060
I plan to start cooking in 30 minutes.

73
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,750
What do we have?

74
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,390
Squid and shrimp.

75
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,810
Grilled, or garlic shrimp?

76
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,570
Ai-san.
He jumped in.

77
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,660
What the—?

78
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,940
Ai-san!

79
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,380
Ai-san!

80
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,030
Why don't you love this family?

81
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,160
You want love? Then pay for it!

82
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,070
Didn't I give you everything?

83
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,490
Stop crying! Get lost!

84
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,880
Ai.

85
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,690
Never fall in love with anyone.

86
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,940
You...

87
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,790
Don't end up like mother.

88
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,780
Ai-san.

89
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,940
Are you okay?

90
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,410
Listen.

91
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,280
Don't dive alone anymore

92
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,910
even if you have experience.

93
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,820
When I tell you to wait, you wait.

94
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,250
It's different from being willful on land.

95
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,370
Okay.

96
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,500
Sorry.

97
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,550
I'm so glad you're safe.

98
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,300
Good morning.

99
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,050
Good morning.

100
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,580
Hmm?

101
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,500
No way.

102
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,130
What is wrong?

103
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,770
Himeka-san.

104
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,790
Eh..
That is...

105
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,630
What is this?

106
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,970
New order.

107
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,910
- Island-style Aglio e Olio.
- Okay!

108
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,930
I'll deliever these two.

109
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,810
Sorry, thanks for helping.

110
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,850
No problem at all.

111
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,800
Here's you order.

112
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,630
Two float sodas.

113
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,990
Sorry, Ai-san.

114
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,140
Take your time eating.

115
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,830
Ai-san.

116
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,330
Hmm?

117
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,640
Feeling dizzy?

118
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,550
- You should see a doctor just in case.
- I'm fine.

119
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,280
Just lost in thought.

120
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,610
About the novel.

121
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,720
Really just thinking about work?

122
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,090
Yeah.

123
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,930
Go rest after eating.

124
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,660
Excuse me.

125
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,190
A customer's calling.

126
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,930
One moment.

127
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:10,920
Okay.

128
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,040
What do you need?

129
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,280
Hello?
Oh.

130
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,240
Finally, you picked up.

131
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,800
Is the manuscript ready?

132
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,070
When did you go from being my friend to my editor?

133
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,220
Sorry.

134
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,610
But spare me the editor role.

135
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,010
Such a garbage reporting
Someone actually dared to publish it.

136
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:37,920
What?

137
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,360
What did they write about you?

138
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,410
Industry insider exposes scandal.

139
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,870
Actress H.

140
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,060
Landed a lead role through sexual favors after breast surgery.

141
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,130
I see.

142
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,530
First, you should ask for a refund on breast surgery.

143
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,400
I love my breasts.

144
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,650
If they're going to make things up, make me 2 meters tall.

145
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,580
Trampling "industry insider" to death.

146
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,450
Are you taking stress out on my secretary?

147
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,670
Fumi complained.

148
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,300
That's unrelated

149
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,380
I've been bullying her since way before this.

150
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,010
Knock it off.

151
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,350
Save the rest of complaints for when I'm back.

152
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,880
Ai.

153
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,840
Are you getting enough sleep?

154
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,540
You sound tired.

155
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,890
Let's meet up at the beauty clinic next time.

156
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,660
Get some treatments together.

157
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,560
I'm in.

158
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,050
Until then

159
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,520
don't push yourself too hard.

160
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,860
You too, Himeka.

161
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,400
(That person might come to the elementary school)

162
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,490
Good work today.

163
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,530
You, too.

164
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,830
Himeka-san.

165
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,300
Fumi? What is it?

166
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,380
I brought you some sweets.

167
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,740
Is it too late?

168
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,420
I'm so happy!

169
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,460
And it's jelly from Keikaen!

170
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,620
My favorite!

171
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,340
Wait a minute.

172
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,650
Did I tell you about this, Fumi?

173
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:33,960
Ah...

174
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:34,970
Um...

175
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,050
Teacher told me.

176
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,090
Huh?

177
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,250
I don't think he'd know my prefernces.

178
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,050
Well, I should be going.

179
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,470
Fumi.

180
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,160
Did you see that article?

181
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,580
That's why

182
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,790
comfort food.

183
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,320
No.

184
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,140
That article about "Actress H"...

185
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,670
I only glanced at it.

186
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,560
But

187
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,510
you can't be sure who it's just from an initial.

188
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,120
How much is "glanced at it"?

189
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,360
Did you read the part about thug threats?

190
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,750
What about stealing someone's husband?

191
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,280
Using popular novelist friend...

192
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,030
- to land the lead in his adaptation?
- These are all lies.

193
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:26,770
Should be...

194
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,180
Should be?

195
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,320
Of course, I don't know all of Himeka-san's private life.

196
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,290
But

197
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,870
the Himeka-san I know...

198
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,300
wouldn't do those things.

199
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,310
Teacher also said, people who gossip are just too idle.

200
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,370
They're busy killing time every day

201
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,320
no energy to imagine.

202
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,620
Himeka-san's efforts and struggles.

203
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,910
Are you angry?

204
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,870
Is that wrong?

205
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,440
Why are you angry?

206
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,460
Because...

207
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,710
I'm going to use the restroom.

208
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,410
Fumi

209
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,840
I'll wait here, take me home later.

210
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,130
It would be troublesome if idle people bother me on the street.

211
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,270
That's...

212
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,020
We're here.

213
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,380
Thanks for the ride.

214
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,480
What am I, your manager?

215
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,400
About that gossip...

216
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,730
I...

217
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,110
I need a favor from you, Fumi.

218
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,900
What can I do?

219
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,960
Yeah.
There is.

220
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,030
Be my lover.

221
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,560
Let's pretend to be a couple.

222
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,950
Wait, what?
Pretend?

223
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,300
If I'm dating a woman, I won't be
accused of sleeping with men for roles.

224
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,030
Even if they say so

225
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,870
I'm just a woman who sleeps with anyone.

226
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:06,960
How about it?

227
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,050
I can't do that.

228
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:09,870
Why not?

229
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,220
Something like that...

230
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,230
I just can't do it.

231
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,400
Geez.

232
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,200
I'm having dinner with my mom.

233
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm leaving.

234
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,610
Thank you for the meal.

235
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,870
- Thank you.
- Yes, have a good day.

236
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,070
Sure.

237
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,200
Eh?

238
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,280
Ai-san.

239
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,410
Sorry, I'm leaving first.

240
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,530
Thanks for today.

241
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,570
- Sorry.
- Get home safe.

242
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,790
Thanks, sis.

243
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,540
(Suddenly got inspired, walking back)

244
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,800
(I need to focus, absolutely don't come today or tomorrow)

245
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,300
Ai!

246
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,600
Hello, sis?

247
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,480
Is now a good time?

248
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,770
I'm sorry

249
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,080
I panicked and sent that text.

250
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,360
It's okay.

251
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,330
Take your time.

252
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,520
You saw Dad near the elementary school?

253
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,140
Not me, Mina did.

254
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,740
She said she saw Grandpa.

255
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,320
Did she see wrong?

256
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,250
Was he just passing by?

257
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,720
Normally if you see your granddaughter you'd call.

258
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,440
That person would never do that.

259
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,870
How is Mina now?

260
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,070
For now

261
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,450
sleeping in her room.

262
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,180
Just thinking about what he could do to Mina...

263
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,300
I can't let her go back to school.

264
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,800
Sis, calm down

265
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,110
I'll figure something out.

266
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,310
Don't worry about me.

267
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,260
Dad caused more trauma to you.

268
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,450
I'm worried about you, too.

269
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,280
-It's good you're not here, better stay away for now. -Don't worry about me.

270
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,300
Sis.

271
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,840
Just take care of Mina

272
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,340
and let her teacher know, too.

273
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,860
Okay, I will.

274
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,350
Thank you, Ai.

275
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,340
Keep in touch.

276
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,860
Actually, this pyramid is made of fire-resistant stone.

277
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,860
Amazing, right?

278
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,350
Hey, don't do that.

279
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,600
Inside is a museum, please look around slowly.

280
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,960
This.

281
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,510
What is that thing?

282
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,430
I found it on the beach.

283
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,990
- Great, found it.
- Take good care of it.

284
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,680
Here's the nose part.

285
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,510
Please align it properly with the nose.

286
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,050
Got it?

287
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,870
And this rubber part...

288
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,020
should rest on the back of the head.

289
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,620
Your girlfriend did really well.

290
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,420
Let me adjust it a bit.

291
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,570
(Ai-san, remember to eat dinner)

292
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,660
(Good night)

293
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,900
(Good morning)

294
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,940
Big brother, no work today?

295
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,820
Well...

296
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,930
Ai-san came here to write.

297
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,990
There are times when he needs to focus.

298
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,730
Then you should focus, too.

299
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,260
Huh?

300
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,940
I am focused.

301
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,770
No, you're not.

302
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,930
Usually customers are charmed by you

303
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,400
we've get tons of repeat customers.

304
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,790
Today, only 4 people asked for your number.

305
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,980
So counting on you for the rest.

306
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,430
You're slacking off.

307
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,620
I have to prep for the environmental forecast seminar this afternoon.

308
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,340
I told you before.

309
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,700
Sorry.

310
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,700
(Ogura Fumi)

311
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,680
Hello?

312
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:40,980
Hello?

313
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,570
Teacher, can you hear me?

314
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,070
Hope I'm not disturbing you.

315
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,050
Monday's contract meeting reminder has been sent, please check.

316
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,080
It's a very important meeting...

317
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,750
Teacher?

318
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,350
I'm in the middle of writing.

319
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,140
Oh, I'm so sorry.

320
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,130
You want love? Then pay for it!

321
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,030
Never fall in love with anyone.

322
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,820
Teacher.

323
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,210
Are you all right?

324
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,590
Teacher.

325
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,580
What makes this island so special...

326
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,650
is its natural beauty, like the ocean and the fire-resistant stones

327
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,980
the warmth of people

328
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,980
and places of encounter.

329
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,170
I'm sure you all will, too.

330
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,780
I recently met a cat myself.

331
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,420
- A cat?
- Yes.

332
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,960
Though he's very willful.

333
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,690
Really cute.

334
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,610
Sounds so cute!

335
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,780
Twenty thousand?

336
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,040
I don't like sharing with others.

337
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,990
Hello.

338
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:58,920
Excuse me.

339
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,680
He's mine
