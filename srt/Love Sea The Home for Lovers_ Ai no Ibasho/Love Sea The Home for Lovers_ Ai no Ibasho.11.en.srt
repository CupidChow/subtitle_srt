1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,050
My life

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,280
has always been shrouded in fear.

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,350
Fear of pain.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,350
Fear of love.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,740
Fear of happiness.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,360
Despite that, I met him

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,110
he taught me something very important.

8
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,430
Good

9
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,430
I've confirmed it.

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
Wow, I didn't expect to get this so soon.

11
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,400
Whom do you have to thank for that?

12
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,550
Someone you rushed work for

13
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,390
and desperately want to see?

14
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,410
- You are absolutely right.
- You bet...

15
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,950
However...

16
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,700
you can work anywhere

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,180
why not finish it on the island?

18
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,260
No way.

19
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,040
The first few days after getting home

20
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,720
I'll stick to that guy in bed.

21
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,430
There's no way to work.

22
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,820
Home...

23
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,340
Hmm?

24
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Nothing.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,430
Although you stay in the city for half of year

26
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,470
you still call the island "home".

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,350
Yeah.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,030
It's more like...

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,270
he's my home.

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,840
Wherever he is

31
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,190
it's my home.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Well then...

33
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,840
I'm heading home now.

34
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,210
See you around.

35
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,330
Get good rest.

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,080
My home...

37
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,190
Where is it?

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Cut! That's a wrap!

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,780
Great job.

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,080
Thank you, everyone.

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Huh?

42
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,790
Leaving already?

43
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,570
My scenes aren't finished yet.

44
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,380
Let's all go out for dinner when it's done

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,790
then we can hit a dart bar until dawn

46
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,590
I'll pass.

47
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,740
You can take my place to get snapped by the tabloids.

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,220
I'm going home to pack.

49
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,830
What? Where are you going?

50
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,530
Two weeks starting tomorrow

51
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm going on vacation.

52
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,010
Seriously? That's awesome!

53
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,610
Bring me back a souvenir...

54
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,770
No way.

55
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,020
It's a waste to spend time on vacation thinking about coworkers.

56
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,900
So cold!

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,010
Good work today.

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Here, this is for you.

59
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,540
I bought it at the food truck during a break.

60
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,110
Let's eat together at home.

61
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,740
Okay.

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
Thank you.

63
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,190
Hey.

64
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,660
We're a couple now. You can relax a little.

65
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,960
A couple...

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,200
It isn't like that.

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Oh.

68
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,970
We are life supporting partners.

69
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,220
If you keep panicking, you're going to crash...

70
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,870
Deep breaths.

71
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
So cute.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,400
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Special Episode 1)

73
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,870
Long time no see, I'm about to dry up.

74
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,570
Oh, is it still just getting close?

75
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,160
No, I've completely withered.

76
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,740
All shriveled up and dry~.

77
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,240
Kaishin~.

78
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,580
Ah, this makes me want to fall in love...

79
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,030
You're teasing me again.

80
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,140
Do you really want to see me?

81
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,040
Is there a stronger phrase to say
"I want to see you"?, Mr. Writer.

82
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,010
Any comparison would still include its own words.

83
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,470
So, "I want to see you" is enough.

84
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,250
You're also teasing me.

85
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,840
You just wait.

86
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,350
It's not scary at all.

87
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,050
Oh, I can be very scary.

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
What do you want me to do?

89
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,450
I want to see you.

90
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,530
How much?

91
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,110
When "I want to see you" isn't enough

92
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,540
what should I say?

93
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,490
I want to see you desperately.

94
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,190
I want to wake up next to you.

95
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,990
Dude.

96
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,110
Are you really gonna pay me?

97
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,350
I'll pay you, be quick, don't stop.

98
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,740
Not next month, not even tomorrow.

99
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,850
Ai-san is coming back today.

100
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,930
Alright, alright.

101
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
What is this?

102
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,050
It's all "Ugh"

103
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,690
and "Ah."

104
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,410
Oh.
It's for a bed scene.

105
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Huh?

106
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,200
He asked me to check it for him.

107
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,220
A tanned, burly man from the island

108
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:41,960
takes a pale, scrawny city boy home from a bar.

109
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,660
I feel like something like this has happened before.

110
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,610
Is this your bed scene, dude?

111
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,380
You're a lucky guy, Ham.

112
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,130
You get a sneak peek at an unpublished work
before the readers.

113
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,370
"His sparkling eyes"

114
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,250
"were not just intimidating,"

115
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,090
"but also incredibly gentle and sweet."

116
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,280
That doesn't sound like you at all, dude.

117
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,650
Go clean.

118
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Not you, dude.

119
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,140
Go clean.

120
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,340
Ah, so beautiful.

121
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,540
What's the rush?

122
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,870
Because I'm going to see the person I love.

123
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,930
The person you love...

124
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,600
In a country where same-sex marriage isn't recognized,

125
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,160
is there any other way to put it?

126
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,320
Marriage?

127
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,670
Coming from Ai?

128
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,840
People change.

129
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,540
Unlike a certain someone,

130
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,810
who's been running in place for a year.

131
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,010
At this rate, you'll just get older and older.

132
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,540
Isn't that pathetic?

133
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,240
So pathetic.

134
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,480
Even Ai-sensei is ganging up on me.

135
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,350
Ai-san.

136
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,150
I missed you so much.

137
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,390
You were just here a month ago...

138
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,950
I'm back.

139
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,110
What took you so long?

140
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,910
These two kept taking detours.

141
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,900
They made us miss our ferry.

142
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,420
People really do change. Such a tattletale.

143
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,760
Say something.

144
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,370
Did you forget something?

145
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,080
I'm still waiting.

146
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,730
Ai-san is back.

147
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,020
Welcome back.

148
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,030
Are they treating us like we're invisible?

149
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,180
This little tattletale is so cute.

150
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,790
Let's go.

151
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,630
To our island.

152
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,340
Tired?

153
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,780
Dealing with them was more exhausting than the travel.

154
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,210
They're so difficult.

155
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,580
I'm completely drained.

156
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,230
Kaishin.

157
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,750
What do you want from me?

158
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,120
Such a spoiled adult.

159
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,890
And a tattletale, too.

160
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,700
But I only tattle to you.

161
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,990
Isn't that great?

162
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,490
For sun protection.

163
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
A gift.

164
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,940
Do you like it?

165
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,650
I love anything you give me, Ai-san.

166
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,330
Most importantly,

167
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,640
I'm just so happy you thought of me.

168
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,730
Thank you.

169
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,380
I'll cherish it.

170
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,810
So?

171
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,050
Where do you want to go tomorrow?

172
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,930
Isn't it obvious?

173
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,390
Move your bangs.

174
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
How's this?

175
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,010
The cutest in the world.

176
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,570
I know.

177
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,010
And handsome.

178
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,450
Also,

179
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,880
very sexy.

180
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,090
Hey, what are you two doing?

181
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Are you going to be all lovey-dovey?

182
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Or are we going diving?

183
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,130
Can't we do both?

184
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,810
Fumi.

185
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Himeka-san.

186
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,530
Please get dressed.

187
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,510
This isn't your house.

188
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,990
I only have eyes for you, Fumi.

189
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Where's Ai?

190
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,010
He went out with Kaishin.

191
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,950
He said they'd be back late.

192
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,620
So we're on our own for dinner.

193
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,550
Ditching his best friend during their trip together.

194
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,730
Well...

195
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,820
They've been looking forward to some alone time.

196
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,950
Are you taking their side, Fumi?

197
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,910
No, that's not it.

198
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,500
I just like seeing them together.

199
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,600
Because Sensei looks so happy.

200
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,660
What about me?

201
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,030
I was happy when I was with Fumi, too.

202
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
By the way,

203
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,640
while I'm on this island,

204
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,680
I'm going to keep going after Fumi.

205
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,480
So you'd better be ready.

206
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,570
Delicious.

207
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,320
Ahh...

208
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,030
You do it.

209
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,630
Feed me.

210
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,950
It tastes better that way.

211
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,880
Please.

212
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,490
Is it good?

213
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,330
Delicious.

214
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,870
Are you happy?

215
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,460
Are you talking about the snorkeling, or the kiss?

216
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,260
About being back at our home.

217
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,110
How did you know?

218
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,090
Because the first thing you always do
when you're back on the island is go diving.

219
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,000
Diving makes you feel like you're home.

220
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Yeah.

221
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,240
So, when I come home,

222
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,690
guess what comes to mind?

223
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,230
Me.

224
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,370
Close enough.

225
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,150
The sight of you swimming, Kaishin.

226
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,720
This ocean is your home, isn't it?

227
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,760
Since it's the place you love and belong to,

228
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,660
I want to love it too.

229
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
Try saying it.

230
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,610
Because I...

231
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,920
love you.

232
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,750
Hold me.

233
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,310
Quick.

234
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
Hey, hurry up.

235
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,230
Well then.

236
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,480
Shouldn't we head back to our home?

237
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,670
Not yet.

238
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,700
There's somewhere I want to take you.

239
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,960
- Can I open my eyes yet?
- Nope.

240
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,310
- You like this, don't you?
- I do.

241
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,450
You peeked just now, didn't you?

242
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,530
No, I didn't.

243
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Okay.

244
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
We're almost there.

245
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,370
You can open your eyes now.

246
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,850
- I can open them?
- Yeah.

247
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
It's beautiful.

248
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,090
So beautiful.

249
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,370
It hasn't changed at all.

250
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,290
Hm?

251
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,610
It's nothing.

252
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,730
Here.

253
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,510
Want some of the lunch I made?

254
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
I do.

255
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,350
Oh, but...

256
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,390
We'll have to disinfect with seawater again.

257
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,510
I brought wet wipes.

258
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,310
Ahh...

259
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,670
Ah.

260
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,270
Today was the best day ever.

261
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,770
The scenery,

262
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,170
the food,

263
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
And?

264
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,920
And I love Kaishin too.

265
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Are you satisfied?

266
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,710
I should be asking you that.

267
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,410
Huh?

268
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,670
Well...

269
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,140
You've been to five-star restaurants abroad.

270
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,030
You've seen exclusive, extravagant shows.

271
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,380
For someone like you who's seen it all,

272
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,810
all I can do is...

273
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,450
show you the scenery on this island.

274
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,850
I'm not sure I can satisfy you, Ai-san.

275
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,330
Kaishin.

276
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,240
That's not true at all.

277
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,030
I...

278
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,420
I love your surprises.

279
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,120
More than looking out over a cityscape,

280
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,190
I'd rather eat while gazing at the ocean.

281
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,760
I love the views you show me, Kaishin.

282
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,100
Most importantly,

283
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,540
I want to be with you.

284
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,670
I'm so bummed I have work early tomorrow.

285
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,310
Don't hold back.

286
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,430
I don't care if it affects me tomorrow.

287
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,630
What time is it?

288
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
It's six.

289
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,240
You were up early yesterday too.
You should sleep in.

290
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,480
It's fine.

291
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,110
I'm already awake.

292
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,800
You go back to sleep.

293
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm going to take a shower.

294
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,700
You know I have a thing for you in glasses.
Are you trying to tempt me?

295
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,140
Do you enjoy seeing me sulk?

296
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,820
I only put them on for the computer.

297
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,750
You swear?

298
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,870
Are you just trying to come home early?

299
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
They look good on you.

300
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,120
I'll keep wearing them
until you get tired of seeing them.

301
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,940
I don't mind.

302
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,950
But can Mr. Tour Guide just skip work?

303
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
Seriously.

304
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,280
Why on earth are you up so early anyway?

305
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,400
To see you off.

306
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,890
And also...

307
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,730
Sit.

308
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,770
Eat before you go.

309
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
You made this?

310
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,840
It's nothing fancy.

311
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,630
You've been practicing for a while, haven't you?

312
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,460
Whatever, just eat.

313
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,010
Don't sulk.

314
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,670
I'm happy you practiced cooking for me.

315
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,900
Even though you're already tired from writing,

316
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,050
you still spent so much time for me.

317
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,710
But Ai-san, you don't have to do anything.

318
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,120
I can do it all.

319
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,450
But I want to do things for you too.

320
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,830
I get it.

321
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,810
In that case,

322
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,980
I'll eat every last bite of this burnt rolled omelet.

323
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Time to eat.

324
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,570
Mhm.

325
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Delicious.

326
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,510
I know I just said you don't have to do anything,

327
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,910
but can I make one selfish request?

328
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
What is it?

329
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,310
Wake up a little early sometimes.

330
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,040
See me off.

331
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,150
A 'be safe' kiss.

332
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,210
That's all the motivation I need to get to work.

333
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,230
Not going anymore?

334
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,440
I'll be back before you know it. Wait for me.

335
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
How should I wait for you?

336
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,950
Topless?

337
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,580
Or bottomless?

338
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,350
- Or maybe completely...
- That's enough.

339
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,460
I'll leave as soon as I'm done eating.

340
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,330
Is it good?

341
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,020
Yeah.

342
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,510
It feels like forever since I've seen you.

343
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,460
I was about to file a missing person report.

344
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,430
I was just busy being happy.

345
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,710
The you from before and the you now,

346
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,340
which is better?

347
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,890
You're the one who's been watching me.

348
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,580
Maybe it's a tie.

349
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Hey.

350
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,300
How is life for you two now?

351
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,680
It's worth diving into headfirst.

352
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,240
You've really changed.

353
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,320
Not that you were bad before.

354
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,150
But that timid,

355
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,370
sleeps-around-to-kill-time version of Ai...

356
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,310
Now,

357
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,370
it's like he can see a future.

358
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,530
Because he's the one who taught me.

359
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,660
No matter what I'm doing,

360
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,030
I can picture myself with him.

361
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,420
So annoying.

362
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,880
Didn't I arrange for you to share a room with Fumi?

363
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,630
She fell asleep before me both nights.

364
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,250
Where are you going?

365
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,750
To find my own future.

366
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,330
Oh.

367
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,000
If Fumi asks you out,

368
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,750
tell her you're busy and turn her down, okay?

369
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,220
Himeka.

370
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,950
I forgot to thank you.

371
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,820
Every one of us

372
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,060
has our own version of happiness.

373
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,300
I want Fumi to know that.

374
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,100
If you want to know the outcome,

375
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,530
you have to dive in headfirst.

376
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,060
Even if it's a place
where your feet can't touch the ground,

377
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,570
a bottomless,

378
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,120
endless ocean.

379
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Oh, right.

380
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,520
I want to buy some new furniture.

381
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,530
Is that okay?

382
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
Of course.

383
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,370
You usually just decide on your own, don't you?

384
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,900
Because this is our home.

385
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,070
That's true.

386
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,730
What do you want to get?

387
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,080
I want wooden furniture.

388
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,760
I even found a store that delivers to the island.

389
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,570
You've thought of everything.

390
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Thank you.

391
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,720
Also, since you wake up early,

392
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,270
and you said you don't want to wake me,

393
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,190
I also looked for a mattress.

394
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,660
How about this one?

395
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,090
Yeah.

396
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,660
Anything you pick, I'll love it, Ai-san.
