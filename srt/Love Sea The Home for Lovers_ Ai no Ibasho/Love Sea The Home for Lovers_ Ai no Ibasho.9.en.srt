1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,150
Are you free?

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,030
You come here often lately.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,150
You're so noisy.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,280
Rather than that.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,420
What happened with you and Fumi...

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,620
Ah...

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,410
She'll probably avoid me again.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,250
It's all my fault.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,520
Himeka-san.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,690
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,480
It was just a rehearsal.

12
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,610
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,650
I say, Himeka...

14
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,510
Why don't you confess?

15
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,910
Your feeling for Fumi...

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,690
Huh, you noticed?

17
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,910
I noticed long ago.

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,020
See?

19
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,090
Everyone in the world has noticed.

20
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Only Fumi doesn't understand.

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,470
- Hurry up and confess.
- Didn't you say…

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,600
you lost once you confess?

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,020
Don't mix novels with reality.

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,450
Can't you help me more?

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,000
I mean...

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,590
You bully Fumi

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,820
and I turn a blind eye, don't I?

28
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,080
So you've been secretly supporting me.

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,780
So, can I force myself on her?

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
I won't stop you.

31
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,030
You're such a bad person.

32
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,000
I have a conscience too.

33
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,740
Just like you'll fall in love.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,850
Fall in love... I'm not that stupid.

35
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,320
You are stupid.

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,870
When was the last time
you slept with another man?

37
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,380
Did you even want another man

38
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,780
to touch you for a moment?

39
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,960
As your longtime best friend, I dare say...

40
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,660
you've fallen in love with Kaishin.

41
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,730
Mina.

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,980
What's wrong with you?

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,110
When I got home yesterday.

44
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,710
Mom asked what happened.

45
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,070
Hmm…

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,230
I said I had a headache.

47
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,430
I lied to her.

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,010
I want you to leave Ai.

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,660
If I told her the truth

50
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,260
mom and Uncle Ai would be scared.

51
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,090
Uncle Kaishin.

52
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,750
You didn't tell them, right?

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I didn't say anything.

54
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,790
But...

55
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,320
since yesterday it's not my head

56
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,640
but here that hurts.

57
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Me, too.

58
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,060
How can I feel better?

59
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,050
About grandpa visiting.

60
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,150
If we could tell them...

61
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,000
What Mom and Uncle Ai want to see

62
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,170
is Mina's happy, joyful smile.

63
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,200
If they knew you were secretly
worried for them

64
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,740
they'd be in pain, too.

65
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
But...

66
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,750
Uncle Kaishin doesn't want
Ai to be scared either, right?

67
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,300
If he gets scared

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,250
I'll hold him and stay by his side.

69
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,580
If Ai-san's hands are trembling

70
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,730
I'll never let go of his hand.

71
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,020
He might find you annoying.

72
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,410
If I can remove his fear
for even a moment.

73
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,430
Whether he finds me annoying,
clingy, or suffocating.

74
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm willing to endure it all.

75
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,260
If Mom gets scared

76
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,740
Mina will hold her tight, too.

77
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
Let's tell them.

78
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,110
Yeah.

79
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,490
Let's do that.

80
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,070
Are you okay?

81
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,740
The meeting's over.

82
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,790
Sorry, Teacher Ai...

83
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,730
I couldn't go with you...

84
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,030
It's fine, rest well.

85
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,480
When a healthy person
suddenly gets a fever

86
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,780
it's a SOS signal from
mind and body.

87
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,610
Calling it a SOS signal...

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,720
It's my own fault for getting carried away.

89
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,990
I'm fine...

90
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,720
Anyway, rest well.

91
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
I'll contact you later.

92
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,070
Ai.

93
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,520
Long time no see.

94
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,460
Yes.

95
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,510
How many years has it been?

96
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,650
Though we occasionally exchange messages.

97
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,540
What do you want?

98
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,510
What's your purpose?

99
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,060
It's about money anyway, right?

100
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,390
When have I ever asked you for money?

101
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,740
You always gave it to me on your own.

102
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,260
- I just wanted to say to you and Mina...
- Don't go near her.

103
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,120
Why can't I see my granddaughter?

104
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,100
Please, don't go near Mina and sister.

105
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,840
I'll do anything.

106
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,500
Then...

107
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,340
Kaishin.

108
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,970
I want you to leave that man.

109
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,810
He has nothing to do with this.

110
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,390
Ai.

111
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,280
Between Mina and Kaishin,

112
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,280
which will you choose?

113
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,220
- Didn't you say you'd do anything?
- Please,

114
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,810
don't involve Mina

115
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
- or Kaishin.
- You're too selfish.

116
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,070
You can only choose one.

117
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,320
Let go.

118
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,570
About what happened to the doctor.

119
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,600
You remember, don't you?

120
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,700
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 9)

121
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,310
Let's go!

122
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
What's happening?

123
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
Stay against the wall behind me.

124
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,740
Uncle Kaishin.

125
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,350
Who are these guys?

126
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,790
When I tell you to run, run fast.

127
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,290
OK?

128
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,530
What do you want?

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
Mina, run now.

130
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,160
Hey! Don't run.

131
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Uncle Kaishin.

132
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,910
- Let go of me.
- Let go of me.

133
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,310
Get up.

134
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
You'll die.

135
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,090
Tell your employer

136
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,260
if he wants to kill me, come himself.

137
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,500
Mom, something happened!

138
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,680
Save us, Uncle Kaishin...

139
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,350
Kaishin!

140
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,320
- Ai.
- Sister.

141
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,840
You said Kaishin was attacked?

142
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,850
What about Mina?

143
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,320
Ai, calm down first.

144
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,690
Mina's fine.

145
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,240
Kaishin is resting inside, too.

146
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,670
Dad did this again...

147
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Again!

148
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,460
Ai,

149
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,070
calm down and take deep breaths.

150
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,850
Kaishin.

151
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,300
Kaishin.

152
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
I'm here.

153
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,080
It's okay now.

154
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm fine.

155
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
It's okay.

156
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,420
Ai-san!

157
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Kaishin.

158
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,550
Kaishin.

159
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Kaishin.

160
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,570
Ai-san.

161
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,380
Are you okay?

162
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,860
Kaishin's not okay at all.

163
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,800
You were cut by a knife.

164
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,150
Compared to injuries from fishing at sea

165
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,640
this small wound is nothing.

166
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,870
It's all my fault.

167
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,700
I caused you to get hurt.

168
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,240
- It's not Ai-san's fault.
- It is my fault...

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's all because of me

170
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,580
Kaishin will end up like the doctor...

171
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,280
The doctor...?

172
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,010
Ai

173
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,140
used to visit child psychiatry.

174
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,200
There was a doctor who took
very good care of him.

175
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,590
Ai trusted him completely.

176
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,110
But that doctor

177
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,830
died in an accident.

178
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,260
After some time passed

179
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,620
we heard a certain rumor.

180
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,690
Rumor?

181
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,740
Our father

182
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,780
might have been involved in that accident.

183
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,510
Disguised as an accident?

184
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,530
I don't know the details.

185
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,520
But

186
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,600
it was a shock to young Ai.

187
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,540
Someone he loved was eliminated by his father.

188
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,030
He couldn't escape from such strong trauma.

189
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,310
Thinking you might disappear, too.

190
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,040
Ai must be very scared.

191
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,790
I'm grateful you told me this,

192
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,510
thank you.

193
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,970
I'll go back to Ai's side now.

194
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,650
About Ai,

195
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,470
please take care of him.

196
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,540
Even after Mina wakes up

197
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,010
please stay here over the night.

198
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,840
I'll prepare

199
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,240
hot dinner.

200
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,770
Let's eat together.

201
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,300
Ai-san?

202
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,540
Ah, no, it's not like that.

203
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,760
That matter

204
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,060
than planned

205
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,600
got resistance, was troublesome.

206
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,150
Ah, but

207
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,220
they're definitely scared.

208
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:02,244
Shut up!

209
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,720
Didn't I say not to appear
in front of Ai again?

210
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,370
No more money.

211
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,594
Wait, wait...

212
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,090
Come in.

213
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,440
You didn't get lost on the way?

214
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,960
This area has changed quite a bit.

215
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,810
Come here.

216
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,680
Welcome back.

217
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,810
What do you want?

218
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,440
The small talk's over?

219
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,310
- Sit down.
- No need.

220
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,534
Sit down!

221
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,110
Good boy, Ai.

222
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,470
Don't involve him.

223
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,100
Oh... you mean Kaishin?

224
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,310
He's not my lover.

225
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,080
We have a financial

226
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,600
contractual relationship.

227
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,050
Contractual relationship!

228
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,760
There's no love between us.

229
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,650
So...

230
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,510
- about him.
- Then...

231
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,360
kick him out immediately.

232
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,900
Can't do it?

233
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,240
- Did you forget about the doctor?
- Shut up!

234
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,380
Don't take him away like the doctor.

235
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,940
Ai just needs to obey daddy.

236
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,990
Don't make that face.

237
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,010
Ai.

238
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,200
Where's Ai-san?

239
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,020
What are you talking about?

240
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,630
Ai-san!

241
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,710
Ai-san!

242
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
Hey!

243
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Ai-san!

244
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,430
Are you okay?

245
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,130
- You aren't hurt, right?
- How rude!

246
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,290
- Do you think he was abused?
- Shut up!

247
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,500
Ai-san, answer me.

248
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,470
Look at me, Ai-san.

249
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,750
You have something to say to him.

250
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,410
Ai.

251
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,020
I want to end this.

252
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,310
What?

253
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,410
End what?

254
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,510
Our relationship.

255
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,260
Let's cancel the contract.

256
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,980
- I won't end it.
- It's over.

257
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,280
You and I are finished.

258
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,250
Ai-san is acting strange, calm down.

259
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,910
I'm alreay...

260
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
tired of you.

261
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,020
I don't believe it.

262
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,040
- Did that guy order you?
- No.

263
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,710
I'm really tired.

264
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,390
I already have someone else.

265
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,800
Though we got along well

266
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,880
and you could pick up Mina

267
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,670
which was convenient for me.

268
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,550
That's why I kept the relationship.

269
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
You're lying.

270
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,590
Kaishin.

271
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
It's over.

272
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,360
If you understand, go back.

273
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,550
Well done.

274
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
Tomorrow

275
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,410
move out of the room.

276
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,830
No need to follow the contract anymore?

277
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
That's right.

278
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,530
There's

279
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,410
no more obligation.

280
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,650
Ah!

281
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
That's great.

282
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,400
I didn't want to obey either.

283
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,400
Because I wanted to do this...

284
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,760
How pitiful.

285
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
What?

286
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,640
Hitting me now is just venting.

287
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,850
But you'll go to prison for assault

288
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,460
and Ai will be left alone.

289
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,570
Famous writer who hospitalized
his father over relationship dispute.

290
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,610
Past exposed, becoming public toy,
losing all dignity.

291
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,450
No!

292
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,020
You stole it.

293
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,690
From now on, again and again.

294
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,760
Ai's place to belong

295
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,410
stolen by you.

296
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,140
Try it if you have the resolve.

297
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,330
Half-hearted resolve,

298
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,290
don't drag Ai into your unfortunate life.

299
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,340
You have no right to be here.

300
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,570
Disappear immediately.

301
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,740
Let's go, Ai.

302
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,070
No.

303
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,310
No!

304
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,970
Stand up.

305
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,210
Ai.

306
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,250
It's over with him.

307
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,950
It's over.

308
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,480
That guy is finished.

309
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,770
Ai.

310
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,110
Come on.

311
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,550
Let's go.

312
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,240
Ai.

313
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,440
I'll be Ai-san's place to belong.

314
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,190
I've always had that resolve.

315
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,430
It hurts.

316
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,080
It hurts so much!

317
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,580
Do you know what you did, brat?

318
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,890
I'll call police, send you to prison.

319
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,100
- Go ahead.
- Wait.

320
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,080
Ai! Come stop him quickly.

321
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,820
I'm going to kill you.

322
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
Stop! Kaishin.

323
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't have to obey you.

324
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,890
My collar's been removed anyway.

325
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,050
Wait, wait.

326
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,460
How much money do you want?

327
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,260
Ai!

328
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,490
Don't just stand there, save me quickly.

329
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,020
Understand, I understand.

330
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,670
I... I apologize.

331
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,290
I apologize, I'm sorry.

332
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,910
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,140
Stop!

334
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
Kaishin.

335
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
You'll be killed.

336
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,380
- Just like the doctor.
- That was just an accident.

337
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,610
It has nothing to do with this guy.

338
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,000
Ai-san, look carefully.

339
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,090
He's just trash.

340
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,580
What can this guy do?

341
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,430
That's right!

342
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,810
I just follow rumors and act tough.

343
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,960
I can't do such things.

344
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,830
Bullying the weak

345
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,530
and shamelessly asking for money,

346
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,480
he just a lying old man.

347
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,590
Don't be controlled by this guy.

348
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,380
Really?

349
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,370
Kaishin won't die?

350
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,550
Won't be killed?

351
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,450
Really.

352
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,440
Look at this guy now.

353
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,850
Do what I ask you to do, you idiot.

354
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,330
Ai.

355
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,310
Save me.

356
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,050
Ai.

357
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
Dad.

358
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,790
Dad has always been scary.

359
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,410
I'm scared now, too now.

360
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,980
But...

361
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,090
Ai.

362
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,820
Dad just

363
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,860
loves you very much.

364
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,640
Of course now, too.

365
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,010
Love me?

366
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,970
Yes.

367
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,960
If you don't want to die alone

368
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,330
don't come looking for us again.

369
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,390
If you break the rules,

370
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,250
all the money and things

371
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,490
mom and I gave you.

372
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,060
I'll take back everything

373
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,560
Even at the ends of the earth
you'll have to spit it out.

374
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,360
Do you understand?

375
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,110
- Ai.
- Don't call me casually.

376
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,140
You and I

377
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,470
are strangers now.

378
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,560
Ai!

379
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,720
I talked with mom

380
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
on the phone.

381
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,670
Mom was also sending money to dad

382
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,490
to protect our family.

383
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,070
She won't do it anymore.

384
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,370
And

385
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,230
that accomplice Rin

386
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,790
for secretly helping the thugs.

387
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,680
She afraid of police investigation

388
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,970
already fled overseas.

389
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,760
Mom and I

390
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,330
haven't talked in long time.

391
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,070
Always being careful

392
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,200
avoiding these topics.

393
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,980
Ai-san.

394
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,900
Are you really okay?

395
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,000
Are you asking if I'm okay?

396
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
What do you think?

397
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,050
I am not okay.

398
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,710
Hmm…

399
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,980
Because...

400
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,070
I said terrible things to Kaishin.

401
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,020
I'm sorry.

402
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,300
I'm so sorry.

403
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,630
You said you were tired and

404
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,650
all I know you were lying.

405
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,190
Don't blame yourself.

406
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,090
But

407
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,010
I'm disappearing without telling me
where you went makes me angry.

408
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,730
Then…

409
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
this.

410
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,930
Charm.

411
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,790
Bracelet.

412
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
Is it already finish?

413
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,020
I wanted to give it to you first.

414
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Put it on me.

415
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
Thank you.

416
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,010
It's very Kaishin's style.

417
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,850
Dolphin

418
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,090
and Ai

419
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,050
go well together.

420
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,710
You must love the ocean from your heart.

421
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Does it hurt?

422
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,690
A kiss from Ai-san will make it better.

423
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,790
Idiot.

424
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,970
It really

425
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,030
thank you so much.

426
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,760
When I knew nothing

427
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,850
you protected Teacher Ai.

428
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,240
You saved a treasure of the literary world.

429
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,590
Did you change your opinion of me a little?

430
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,580
Why do you go this far?

431
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,880
This far meaning?

432
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,510
Everything.

433
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,810
Mr. Kaishin

434
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,630
why you do for Teacher Ai.

435
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,670
I just wanted to.

436
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,480
I learned how that giving all
means no regrets.

437
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,470
What if

438
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,070
Teacher Ai rejected you?

439
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,700
I'd accept it.

440
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,970
At least I tried my best.

441
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,500
Even so, you can't bind someone's heart.

442
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,070
Mr. Kaishin.

443
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,050
Will you stay with the teacher forever?

444
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,150
Whether we can keep going

445
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,580
let him decide.

446
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,210
Not me.

447
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,540
Hello?

448
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,230
Big brother.

449
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,780
Today regulars asked again
when you're coming back.

450
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,730
People ask every day.

451
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,370
So did you answer?

452
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,380
Yes, as you said.

453
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,930
So...

454
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,980
please really come back.

455
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,040
Otherwise I'll be a liar.

456
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,730
No problem.

457
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,330
I'll definitely go back.

458
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,110
Taking the night boat in three days.

459
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,590
Not anger,

460
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,550
not impulse.

461
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,210
All for love.

462
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,900
Feeling better?

463
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,430
For your kiss,

464
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,550
I can get hurt every day.

465
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,040
Need to avoid the wound

466
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,460
You scared me!
