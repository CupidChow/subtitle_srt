1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,650
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:11,990
Well

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,990
I'm Kaishin Muto.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,170
This year's...

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,710
Co-creating the Future Oceans and Islands symposium...

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,030
officially begins now.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,250
So, first

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,680
please take a look at this.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,190
This is a photo of the seabed.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,040
This part

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,950
does anyone know what this is?

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,560
A type of rock?

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,560
A fire-resistant stone.

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:35,870
Well guessing, but no...

15
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,680
Actually, this...

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,330
is coral.

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,560
You're here.

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,460
Don't look so annoyed seeing me.

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,830
Big brother is so handsome, right?

20
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:51,940
Don't get me wrong

21
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,870
- I'm not here to pick a fight.
- Whatever. I don't feel anything.

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,410
This symposium...

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,950
was supposed to be a one-time thing a few years ago.

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,390
But Big brother insisted on keeping it going.

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,930
He volunteered to handle all the troublesome work...

26
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,500
and convinced everyone.

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,190
This island...

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,730
is my hometown.

29
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,480
This ocean...

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,070
is my home.

31
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,650
I think many of you consider home
to be where you live with family

32
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,990
or the place you return to at night.

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,050
But...

34
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,930
for me, home is...

35
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,780
a place...

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,050
that confirms...

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,010
my existence.

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,770
Ai-san.

39
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,550
Thank you.

40
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,130
Why the sudden thank me?

41
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,490
I didn't expect you to come this early

42
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm happy.

43
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,080
Just came to find some fun and kill time.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,290
Otherwise I wouldn't come.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,830
Hey.

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you doing?

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,230
Hold still.

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,570
It's hot.

49
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,260
No, you need to button up.

50
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,930
Why?

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,240
Are you the class monitor?

52
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,760
Or the disciplinary teacher?

53
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,810
That's right.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,710
Very indecent.

55
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,650
Huh?

56
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,180
In this refreshing scenery

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,140
full of bite marks is't good.

58
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,870
But if you want to show off, that's fine, too.

59
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,970
No.

60
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,210
This is perfect.

61
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,660
Everyone will know the legendary handsome guy has a dog.

62
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,900
A fierce dog at that.

63
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,350
A dog in heat.

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,260
Then the owner must be in heat too.

65
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,300
You...

66
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,740
Oh!

67
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,340
It's almost afternoon.

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,590
Anywhere you want to go?

69
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,400
Don't you have other work?

70
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,970
Not today.

71
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,670
Or do you want to go back to work?

72
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,070
Go to Kaishin's house.

73
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,510
Huh?

74
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,580
I want to go to Kaishin's house.

75
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,450
Take me there.

76
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,260
Since I brought you home

77
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,910
stop hesitating.

78
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,470
Do as you please.

79
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,430
- Cut, good.
- Okay, this scene is done.

80
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,030
Moving on to the next.

81
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,190
Well...

82
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,250
Hello...

83
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,280
Excuse me.

84
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,240
Will you be staying to watch the next scene?

85
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,670
Oh, am I in the way?

86
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,670
No.

87
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,790
It's just...

88
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,320
there's a back hug scene.

89
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,010
I am worried you might mind.

90
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,860
Ah, no, no, no, no.

91
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,780
Please don't worry about me.

92
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,350
After all, I'm Himeka-san's...

93
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,130
When it comes to Himeka-san

94
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,090
I'll give her my full support.

95
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,420
You're really...

96
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,940
a wonderful partner.

97
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,190
Partner...

98
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,590
Is this okay?

99
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,690
Teacher will be back tomorrow.

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,330
I won't be able to look after Himeka-san like now.

101
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
Will you be lonely?

102
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,320
No.

103
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,930
It's not about being loneliness

104
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,040
I'll be lonely.

105
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,440
So from now on

106
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,690
come whenever you're free.

107
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,530
Are you listening?

108
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,920
Yes.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,410
Let's wraps things up.

110
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,830
Thank you for this time, Fumi.

111
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,640
You're welcome.

112
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,990
In that case, I'll give the capable secretary a reward.

113
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,210
How about a kiss on the forehead?

114
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,230
No.

115
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,000
Then I'll think of a better reward than that.

116
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
Ah.

117
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,190
This isn't a reward.

118
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,830
I thought I'd practice before filming.

119
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,180
A little practice with my partner.

120
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,700
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 5)

121
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,630
Are we there?

122
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,940
Maybe we should forget it?

123
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,410
My place is really small.

124
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,580
I had no expectations from the start.

125
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,230
So hurtful...

126
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,670
Stop babbling, hurry up.

127
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,360
Where is it?

128
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,710
Right there.

129
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,070
Awesome.

130
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,280
This is the workspace.

131
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,730
Lots of diving gear.

132
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,100
There's a cat, too.

133
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,500
Just like you, Ai-san.

134
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,280
Alright, let's go.

135
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,930
Weren't you the one who wanted to come?

136
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,590
Okay.

137
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,100
This way.

138
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,880
Come on in.

139
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,030
Excuse me.

140
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,210
Eh..

141
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,280
This is my room.

142
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,170
Like an alien's home, isn't it?

143
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,070
Well...

144
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,060
Yeah.

145
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,830
Kaishin.

146
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,620
Have you thought about leaving this island?

147
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,210
Not that I haven't.

148
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,120
Hmm?

149
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,240
If I studied elsewhere

150
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,640
maybe I could learn better ways to protect

151
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
this island and ocean.

152
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,690
All about island and ocean.

153
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,150
How did you get that idea.

154
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,970
Huh?

155
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,130
Isn't it obvious?

156
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,230
Because I love them.

157
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,890
That's it?

158
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,260
That's why I fought with my dad.

159
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,640
Huh?

160
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,260
What my dad cares about

161
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,410
is the catch right in front of him.

162
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,170
He doesn't care about the environment and future.

163
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,070
When I was fifteen

164
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,290
we went fishing,

165
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,450
a sea turtle got caught in the net.

166
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,850
Guess what my dad did?

167
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,970
He threw the turtle and net into the sea together.

168
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,810
I got angry and said I'd save the turtle

169
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,680
so he threw me in, too.

170
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,740
That's terrible.

171
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,540
The seabed I fell to was quite deep.

172
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,270
When I finally climbed up, dad said.

173
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,430
If you want to save it, save it yourself.

174
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,050
I'm the one who feeding you.

175
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,820
Earn your own money before complaining.

176
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,010
To a fifteen-year-old?

177
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,800
I was stubborn, didn't ask for help.

178
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,130
But...

179
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,590
one of my dad's crew members pulled me onto the boat.

180
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,740
Because of that

181
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,020
that man got fired.

182
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,270
That's why I left home

183
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,700
and I live here.

184
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,330
Are you trying to comfort me?

185
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,760
Is it working?

186
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,480
Seems I'm lucky today.

187
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,230
It will get even better.

188
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,430
Take me.

189
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,750
Make me yours! Now!

190
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,180
This house has thin walls.

191
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,740
I want them to hear.

192
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,540
Do you know when to stop?

193
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,270
Whose fault is that?

194
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,320
If not me, you'd be crying now.

195
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,020
You're the one who's crying.

196
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,210
And so loudly.

197
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,320
The whole street heard.

198
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,350
Well

199
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,340
it's not my house anyway.

200
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,810
Let me be clear.

201
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,070
I really can't take much more of this.

202
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,680
I probably used up a lifetime of luck.

203
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,310
Someone like you actually came to my house...

204
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,100
lying on my bed

205
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,490
in my arms...

206
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,550
Unbelievable.

207
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,530
You've never brought anyone home before?

208
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,230
Who could I bring?

209
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,910
True.

210
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,060
This might be a once-in-a-lifetime luck.

211
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,690
So you must remember forever.

212
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,000
I

213
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,060
have to go back tomorrow.

214
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,280
Really.

215
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,650
Time flew by.

216
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,090
Don't go.

217
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,670
Just kidding.

218
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,090
I have no right to ask you.

219
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,190
Try it.

220
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,460
Go on, ask me.

221
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,370
Can I?

222
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,460
I'm at an age where I can be a little selfish.

223
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,000
If Kaishin ask me, I might agree.

224
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,800
I know.

225
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,020
When you want someone to grant your wish

226
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,220
you have to give something in return.

227
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,310
But...

228
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,160
I have nothing to give.

229
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,200
I don't want anything.

230
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,200
I've never asked even my parents.

231
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,440
So I won't force you.

232
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,190
But let me just say this.

233
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,270
If...

234
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,740
If I ask you and you say no...

235
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,560
I'll never be able to ask anyone again.

236
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,140
Don't go.

237
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,210
I promise.

238
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,810
I won't be mean to you

239
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,810
won't disturb your work

240
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,220
won't wake you up early.

241
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,460
I'll do whatever you say.

242
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,370
So...

243
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,630
Please stay with me.

244
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,150
That won't do.

245
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,900
What's this about not being mean.

246
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,120
That's not like you.

247
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,490
If Kaishin doesn't wake me up

248
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,940
when would I start working?

249
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,450
Being obedient to everything

250
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,080
that's a spoiled dog.

251
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,220
Because you are you

252
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,690
you dare hold me in this shitty house

253
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,150
on this narrow bed.

254
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,760
Because you're Kaishin with guts

255
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,650
I'll grant your request.

256
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,520
Even if you don't behave

257
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,200
as long as you ask

258
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,260
I'll make it happen for you.

259
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,190
I will stay.

260
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,080
What is it?

261
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,500
Huh?

262
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,210
I don't want you to see me crying.

263
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,840
Are you crying?

264
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:22,950
No...

265
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,040
Don't poke me.

266
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,550
Stop poking me!

267
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,610
Teacher Ai.

268
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,050
Please come back no matter what.

269
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,010
There's an important contract to sign tomorrow.

270
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,700
Oh.
Morning, big brother.

271
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,090
Good morning.

272
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,310
That's great, isn't it?

273
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,350
That handsome guy is going back.

274
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,090
Yeah.

275
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,720
This trip...

276
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,940
must be wonderful memories.

277
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,580
He'll definitely

278
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,000
come back again.

279
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,810
Yeah.

280
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,180
Huh?

281
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,960
What's that?

282
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,240
What?

283
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,530
I thought you didn't have a car.

284
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,530
Did I ever say that?

285
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,060
You picked me up in a gaudy tricycle

286
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,300
and rode a motorcycle that hurt my butt.

287
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,390
This is for towing boats.

288
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,500
Shoud I tow you? Ai-san.

289
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,000
Stop sulking.

290
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,900
It's the last day after all.

291
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,510
I said no means no.

292
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,280
Can't extend the stay.

293
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,740
The contract meeting is absolutely unmissable.

294
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,540
I'm sorry.

295
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,430
It's okay.

296
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,470
The promise we made...

297
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,790
I couldn't keep it.

298
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,880
Nothing forgotten?

299
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,310
A tip.

300
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,050
With such a big tip

301
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,580
please come again next time.

302
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,700
I probably won't come again.

303
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,820
I suppose so.

304
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,520
You came reluctantly this time.

305
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,660
When I first met you, you looked awful, I was worried.

306
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,020
Worry about yourself.

307
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,040
Eat breakfast properly.

308
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,750
Don't stay up late so often.

309
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,410
You're not young anymore.

310
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,470
You'll get wrinkles.

311
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,190
Kaishin.

312
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,060
I'm here.

313
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:42,960
Ai-san.

314
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,060
I have to go now.

315
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,540
I'll get that.

316
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,190
This is expensive, right?

317
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,020
Aren't you going?

318
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,110
Ai-san.

319
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,620
What is it?

320
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,770
You must love the sea from your heart.

321
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,460
This story...

322
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,180
I'll never forget it.

323
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,340
Take care of yourself.

324
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,470
Kaishin.

325
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,870
So

326
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
weird name.

327
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,160
What's the origin?

328
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,360
Because it matches your name.

329
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,670
What?

330
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,960
How does it match?

331
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,500
Someday you'll

332
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,390
fall in love with the ocean.

333
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,290
You must love the sea from your heart.

334
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,720
How much?

335
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,740
Huh?

336
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,740
How much do I pay

337
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,290
to take Kaishin with me?

338
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,320
Just a little longer.

339
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,890
Just a little longer.

340
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,450
I want to finish writing this story.

341
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,490
I don't come cheap, you know

342
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,050
I can afford it.

343
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,330
Cleaning, checked.

344
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,600
Meals, checked.

345
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,320
And me?

346
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,440
Perfect.

347
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,200
Just arrived.

348
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,220
That was a long travel. You must be tired.

349
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,420
Fumi, I've decided on your reward.

350
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,700
How about a kiss on the forehead?

351
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:53,630
No.

352
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,560
Then I'll think of a better reward than that.

353
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,680
Ah.

354
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,200
You're making things difficult for me

355
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,530
- I need to prepare for Teacher Ai's return.
- Let's start right now.

356
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,810
Come.

357
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,680
Huh?

358
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,960
Actress comfort lap pillow.

359
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,720
This is something you can't enjoy even at a paid fan meet.

360
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,140
You must have done something good in a past life.

361
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,110
I'd rather know what crime I committed in a past life...

362
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,540
Oh.

363
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,840
Just rest when I tell you to

364
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,830
I'll wake you up on time.

365
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,420
Stop messing with me.

366
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,120
You don't know anything.

367
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,930
You're not into women.

368
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,390
Is Ai home?

369
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,770
Seems like it.

370
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,410
Yes.

371
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,090
Welcome home.

372
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,830
Teacher Ai...

373
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,630
His name is written as "heart of the sea".

374
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,330
Kaishin.

375
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,030
I bought him from the island.

376
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:40,840
It's a pleasure to meet you.

377
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,040
Huh?

378
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,740
Yes.

379
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,340
I'm Kaishin.

380
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,960
Already asleep.

381
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,160
Sleeping soundly.

382
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,080
