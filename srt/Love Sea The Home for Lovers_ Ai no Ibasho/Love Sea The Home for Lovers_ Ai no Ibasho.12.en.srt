1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,570
My life

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,230
has always been supported those
who create souls of books and movies

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,580
the very people I admire.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,780
But I never thought

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,960
someone I admire would ever step into my life.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,860
No working on vacation!

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,700
But work just found me.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,260
We're supposed to be together

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,780
but you're not interested in me?

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,860
Of course I'm interested.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,290
That's why I came here with you.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,280
Then we should be looking at each other, like this.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,530
Right?

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,090
Huh?

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,990
Wait, please don't.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Don't cover up. Let me see your face.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,880
- No.
- Why not?

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,620
I should be the one taking pictures of you.

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,930
No way.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
Why not?

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,090
You're so cute.

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,970
No...

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,610
Let me take it.

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,430
Himeka-san, you're so cute...

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,050
Do you have fun?

26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,210
It is a lot of fun.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Falling for me all over again?

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,780
Well...

29
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,090
Hmm?

30
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,880
I think I'll go for a walk.

31
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,770
Trying to run away?

32
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,730
They say when you come to the beach,
you have to play in the water.

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,430
What?
Who says so?

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,260
Your boss.

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm going to get all wet!

36
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,790
Of course. I'm splashing you.

37
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,390
Come on!

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,490
Ready to surrender?

39
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,410
I give up!

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,700
For now.

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
The trip isn't over yet.

42
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,700
Don't you forget it.

43
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,630
Your shirt's open.

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
You're back.

45
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Are you tired?

46
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,630
You're so adorable.

47
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,910
Button up your shirt.

48
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,590
It's too hot. I don't want to.

49
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,590
It's your skin's worst enemy.

50
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,710
What are you doing?

51
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,950
I'm wiping your sweat.

52
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,960
Is this some custom from your hometown?

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
It is.

54
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,840
You should get used to it.

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,750
My home is your home now.

56
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,230
And you become this pervert.

57
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,250
You're the pervert for liking to bite me.

58
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,630
I'm nothing compared to you.

59
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,130
Ow.

60
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Ouch.

61
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,640
In front of such a possessive dog

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,460
dressing like that...

63
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,170
I'm not going to just let this go.

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,770
Tonight

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,700
we're having dinner with Fumi.

66
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,090
Let's hurry up and eat

67
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm confident I can sweep you off you feet.

68
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,690
Or...

69
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,310
should we have a little warm-up before dinner?

70
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,910
Deal!

71
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,770
Teacher.

72
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,340
Teacher Ai, I've been looking all over for you.

73
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,260
Don't tell me you two are having dinner
alone again tonight.

74
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,810
No way.

75
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,010
Right?

76
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Right?

77
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
Huh?

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,700
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Special Episode 2)

79
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,030
Cheers!

80
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,010
Aren't you busy tonight?

81
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,630
Ask Fumi.

82
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,370
We're on a trip together.

83
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,400
We should at least have one meal together.

84
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,940
This is supposed to be a trip
for just the two of us.

85
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
You two just go home.

86
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,470
Oh.

87
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,010
We've barely seen the owner of the house

88
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,360
I feel bad for imposing on them

89
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
I see.

90
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,290
So we're not the only ones being disturbed?

91
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
I forgive you.

92
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,620
What temptation is Fumi-san running from?

93
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,740
What could it be?

94
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,250
What do you think, Ai?

95
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,960
You two can do whatever you want after dinner.

96
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,930
Teacher!

97
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,000
We won't get in your way.

98
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,330
Alright, alright.

99
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,160
If there's anywhere you two want to go,
just let me know

100
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,530
I'll have my brother take you.

101
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,680
No need. It'd be a waste to have him
help us during the peak season.

102
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,930
Business must be good, right?

103
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,690
It's not bad.

104
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
Right?

105
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,650
Hey.

106
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Peel this shrimp for me.

107
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,460
Okay.

108
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,950
During the peak season,
for about five or six months.

109
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,700
I stay on the island, too.

110
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,030
My job can be done from anywhere.

111
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,910
Luckily, life is flexible.

112
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,910
That's true.

113
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,780
When I first heard you were going to live
on the island, I was scared to death.

114
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,900
It's a good thing you go back and forth.

115
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,660
Ai is my only friend.

116
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,080
- Is Ai-san all you need?
- That's right.

117
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,790
Yes.

118
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
If you want more

119
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I'll peel them.

120
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,740
No, it's fine. You should have some, too.

121
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,490
Um...

122
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,300
I have a question.

123
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,130
Have you two ever been angry with each other?

124
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,430
- Ai-san gets angry all the time.
- Hey!

125
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,000
What about... Kaishin-san?

126
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,090
He's always so naturally caring.

127
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,410
Like this.

128
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,270
But he has been angry before.

129
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,330
The one time he got really mad.

130
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Alone?

131
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Cheers.

132
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,870
Cheers.

133
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,660
He's...

134
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,770
Nothing happened between us.

135
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,970
Really.

136
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,370
Then why were you so close?

137
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,420
It wasn't me.

138
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,450
He was the one who got close.

139
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,650
I...

140
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,070
Your brother asked me

141
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,650
out for a drink.

142
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,280
I called you, too

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,400
I've done nothing.

144
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,970
Don't be mad.

145
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,540
He held your hand.

146
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,600
I pulled it away.

147
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,180
Where else did he touch you?

148
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,500
My waist.

149
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,220
Where else?

150
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
My leg.

151
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,190
- Take off your pants.
- What?

152
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,260
Take them off.

153
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,350
And?

154
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,910
That's...

155
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,140
all...

156
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
You know

157
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,940
that when I get mad,
I stay mad for a long time.

158
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,530
So what should I do?

159
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,820
Figure it out yourself.

160
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,170
I don't want to imagine
the end of that story.

161
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,000
What happened next?

162
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,480
I'm not going to tell you for free.

163
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,450
I want to know the ending.

164
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,020
What happened next?

165
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,480
Look at Ai's eyes.

166
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,040
You can tell just by looking at him.

167
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,000
He likes it when Kaishin is angry.

168
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,710
What are you, a fortune teller?

169
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,010
I see it.

170
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,250
If that's the case, you're better hurry back.

171
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,700
Don't mind if we do.

172
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
Huh?

173
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Where are you going?

174
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,580
Take your time, Fumi-san.

175
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,190
We'll see you after tomorrow.

176
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,750
Let's go.

177
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
Bye-bye.

178
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
Bye-bye.

179
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,740
Bye-bye?

180
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,660
I love it when Fumi is clueless.

181
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,110
Just like how Ai loves an angry Kaishin.

182
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,170
Let's finish this up, and then we'll go back, too.

183
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't hold back anymore.

184
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,540
Why are you looking at me like that?

185
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,190
I like seeing Kaishin angry...

186
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,460
You were trembling that day...

187
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,970
That's why I love it so much.

188
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,650
I trust you.

189
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,280
You like turning things into stories for me, don't you?

190
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,820
I don't want to make you mad.

191
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,220
But...

192
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
But...

193
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,550
I want something even more intense.

194
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,830
- Do you know why Kaishin got angry at Ai?
- Hmm?

195
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,370
Hmm?

196
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,310
You still don't get it?

197
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,370
I don't want to know how my boss's bedroom scene ends.

198
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,570
If you keep drinking, Fumi,

199
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,560
I might do something to you.

200
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,270
Is that why you got me drunk?

201
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,280
You drink because you know
what's happening, don't you?

202
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,350
Yeah.

203
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,350
I want to get drunk...

204
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,240
Wait, hold on.

205
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,520
Where are you touching me?

206
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,170
Because you're so cute, Himeka-san.

207
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,150
But we're not official.

208
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,530
You're still hung up on that?

209
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,310
I...

210
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,900
I like you, Himeka-san.
Hold on.

211
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,970
So we'd only be dating to get into bed?

212
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,460
Fumi, don't tell me you're...

213
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,290
just after my body?

214
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,890
That's not it.

215
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,050
Sex...

216
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,410
Hmm?

217
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,260
I know this sounds foolish.

218
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
But...

219
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,910
Can I make your heart

220
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,880
and your body

221
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,250
as my entire reason for living?

222
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,190
I just wanted to see that look on your face.

223
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,290
Stealing my clothes again?

224
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,340
Because it's comfortable.

225
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,280
What about Ai-san's cheap stuff?

226
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,660
It's custom-made silk pajamas.

227
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,270
Why aren't you wearing it?

228
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,550
I just want to wear this one.

229
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,210
So this is the 'boyfriend shirt' feeling.

230
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,910
Kaishin...

231
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,350
you've given me so many firsts.

232
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,570
Stargazing at the beach.

233
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,490
Swimming in the ocean at night.

234
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,080
Riding on the back of your motorcycle.

235
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,430
Racing across the island.

236
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,040
Making love on the beach... that was a first, too.

237
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Mmm.

238
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,550
And...

239
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,790
this amazing gift.

240
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,760
Up until now,

241
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,230
I've certainly received a lot of gifts.

242
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,380
Designer brands

243
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,850
fine wine, and watches...

244
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,840
But nothing has ever been as special as this.

245
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,870
Because you made it for me yourself, Kaishin.

246
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,750
So I want to give you a gift in return.

247
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,200
That's another first for me

248
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,640
I've had a lot of firsts, too.

249
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,880
My first time eloping.

250
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,100
My first time being a dad.

251
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,660
Dressing up formally.

252
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,070
Ah.

253
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,040
Though I don't do it often.

254
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,550
There's still a plenty of things I want to do.

255
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,250
Like...

256
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,620
climbing a mountain for the first time.

257
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,130
Let's go together.

258
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,600
We'd have to sleep in a tent, you know.

259
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,780
Does it have AC?

260
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Huh?

261
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,370
That would spoil the mood.

262
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,270
It'll be hot, won't it?

263
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,060
Then let's install AC.

264
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Thanks.

265
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,630
What else?

266
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,790
I want to travel abroad for the first time.

267
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,930
Where do you want to go?

268
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,790
I'll take you.

269
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,040
We can go diving in Thailand.

270
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,690
After that, let's go to Canada.

271
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,710
I studied abroad there.

272
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,690
It'll be a lot of fun.

273
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,230
I'm so happy.

274
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,560
I'm happy, too.

275
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,000
Good night, Kaishin.

276
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,020
Good night.

277
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Ai-san?

278
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Can't sleep?

279
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Yeah.

280
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,930
Go put on your own pajamas.

281
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,640
Are you kidding me?

282
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,960
I'm just so excited.

283
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,830
Thinking about my future with Kaishin...

284
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,770
I'm too excited to sleep.

285
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,330
I'm such a kid.

286
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,460
Well then

287
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,300
let's be two kids staying up past our bedtime.

288
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,970
Want to sneak out?

289
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,870
- It lit!
- It did!

290
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,930
It's lit!

291
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,420
Ai-san, you've never...

292
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,990
set off fireworks at the beach before,
have you?

293
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,090
Never.

294
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,820
It's so beautiful.

295
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,460
This is amazing.

296
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,350
- It's so pretty.
- Look.

297
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,330
What do you think I wrote?

298
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,120
Oh, I knew it instantly.

299
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,350
- What is it?
- Ai!

300
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,070
You got it.

301
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,470
Amazing.

302
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,880
You knew right away.

303
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,430
- That's my Ai-san.
- Well, you're easy to read.

304
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
But...

305
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,310
No one here.

306
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,070
It's so peaceful.

307
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,780
What are you smiling about?

308
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,160
I am just remembering when we came here to see the stars.

309
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,490
It feels like so long ago.

310
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,980
I was so arrogant back then.

311
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,860
You were.

312
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,160
I'd never met anyone so arrogant.

313
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Mmm.

314
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
Back then, I...

315
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,820
felt like I was the luckiest person.

316
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,290
I was the one who was saved that day.

317
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,990
Even knowing our time was limited.

318
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,960
I wanted to throw caution to the wind
and go after you.

319
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,870
I felt like I'd never get another chance like it.

320
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,970
Thank you, Ai-san.

321
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,180
For what?

322
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,830
For being by my side.

323
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,460
I used to imagine that waking up next to you

324
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,680
would be the greatest happiness.

325
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,900
But now...

326
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,520
I've gotten greedier.

327
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,010
I want to build a future with you.

328
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,030
I can picture it.

329
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,890
I can see it, too.

330
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
Kaishin.

331
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,610
I...

332
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,030
love you from the bottom of my heart.

333
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,380
I don't know if forever exists

334
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,390
but...

335
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,040
can I believe in it?

336
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,410
Out of 10, what's my score?

337
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
An 8.

338
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,260
Because I like the number 8.

339
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,880
For whatever led me to this person

340
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,370
to all of this.

341
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,380
I am so grateful.

342
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
I love you.

343
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,490
What's wrong?

344
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,410
Because I am sleepy in mornings.

345
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Come on.

346
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,580
The two of them are waiting for us for breakfast.

347
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,650
I love you.

348
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,750
I want to spend my mornings with you, too.

349
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,770
Okay.

350
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Let's go.

351
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,560
Ah, I'm starving.

352
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,760
Teacher Ai, Kaishin-san.

353
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,040
Good morning.

354
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,210
How are you feeling?

355
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,390
Looks like I don't even need to ask.

356
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,430
You two look so happy.

357
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,640
Look who's talking.

358
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,620
As for me.

359
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,860
I'm the

360
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,540
happiest person in the world.

361
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,840
No, I am

362
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
the happiest person.

363
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Let's go have breakfast.

364
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,230
Yeah.

365
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,200
Happiness...

366
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,760
It's like a boat crossing the sea.

367
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,270
Looking back at the passing by

368
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,030
while gazing into the eyes of the person in front

369
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,010
rowing together toward an unknown future.

370
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
No matter when

371
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,120
we head toward an ocean vaster than today.

372
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,450
Himeka-san.

373
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,490
I'm also happy, too.

374
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,370
Hey, Fumi.

375
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,620
We're dating now.
