1
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,390
Good work.

2
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,110
You're early today.

3
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,110
Wasting time diving after every investigation.

4
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,610
Not a waste of time at all.

5
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,640
I have something to do later.

6
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,190
I see.

7
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,670
Hello

8
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,790
I've arrived.

9
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,120
Long journey, must be tired.

10
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,290
The eco-guide we arranged will pick you up soon.

11
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,280
Eco-guide.

12
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,780
A young guy who helped us with photo shoots before.

13
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,310
Young but spirited.

14
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,270
Now I'm just left here getting in the way.

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,030
Don't say that.

16
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,670
He'll surely help you finish your writing smoothly.

17
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,430
Hey!

18
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,700
I have a bad feeling.

19
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,730
Rakumoto-san.

20
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,990
Rakumoto-san.

21
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,970
Cancel.

22
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,050
Cancel it for me.

23
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,680
Got hung up on.

24
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,610
Are you Ai Rakumoto-san?
Don't call my name

25
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,070
I'll be found out.

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,110
Be found out?

27
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,370
Don't you know who I am?

28
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,090
You're Ai-san, right?

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,140
Nice to meet you.

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,070
I'm your eco-guide, Kaishin Muto.

31
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,120
Kaishin means "heart of the sea".

32
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,620
Well then.

33
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,010
Let's go to the inn.

34
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,280
Ah! What.

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,370
Are you kidding me?

36
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,480
Huh?

37
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,210
How could I ride in such an embarrassing vehicle?

38
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,810
Unbelievable.

39
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,610
Can't even fit the luggage in.

40
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,400
Do you know how much this costs?

41
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,030
You'd have to pay if it breaks.

42
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,920
- Hurry up and get another vehicle.
- Take about an hour.

43
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,390
Can you wait?

44
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,780
Put over.

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,530
Do you understand?

46
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,760
I'm going back.

47
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,340
Ahh.

48
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,680
We're here.

49
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,070
I want the earliest boat back.

50
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,050
Arrange it for me.

51
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,000
You just arrived

52
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,440
I never wanted to come.

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,630
Then why did you come?

54
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,000
That's because

55
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,480
new work.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,140
Mm-hmm.

57
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,250
What?

58
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,620
New novel.

59
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,340
Well...

60
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,700
I can't quite write it.

61
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,180
Kind of like.

62
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,360
Writer's block.

63
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,970
That story

64
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,840
takes place on a small island.

65
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,950
Something about "a Teacher who only knows cities
should experience island life".

66
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,490
Idiot editor bought a boat ticket.

67
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,090
Half-forced me to come.

68
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,370
So sleep-deprived and seasick.

69
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,490
And then.

70
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,860
Met another idiot picking me up.

71
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,710
Have secretary arrange it.

72
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,640
What?

73
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,680
One week later.

74
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,410
Next boat is in a week.

75
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,260
You're kidding.

76
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,570
No no no no!

77
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,340
There must be other ways besides boats.

78
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,240
Anything will do.

79
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,870
Hurry and let me leave.

80
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,490
So beautiful.

81
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,570
Welcome Ai-san

82
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,740
to our island.

83
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,800
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 1)

84
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,410
Anything else you need?

85
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,570
I don't understand the dialect.

86
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,500
I said.

87
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,680
- Anything else you need help with?
- So you can speak normally.

88
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,180
Get out.

89
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,240
Go away.

90
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,020
Room key is here.

91
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,950
Contact me if you need anything.

92
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,550
My contact info

93
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,710
is by the bed.

94
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,740
See you.

95
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,030
Thank you.

96
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,640
Okay.

97
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,540
Cheers.

98
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,320
Every night at the bar.

99
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,380
Exciting things happen.

100
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,210
Tonight for sure, too.

101
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,230
Tonight's star just shows up.

102
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,230
Please have a seat.

103
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,060
What would you like?

104
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,230
Anything strong?

105
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,820
Oh...

106
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,720
How about Heart of the Sea?

107
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,250
Heart of the Sea.

108
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,200
Kaishin.

109
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,870
Other than that.

110
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,940
Anything is fine.

111
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,550
Sir.

112
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,420
Are you big brother's eco-guide customer?

113
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,890
You

114
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,200
are that guide's younger brother

115
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,510
I'm his younger brother.

116
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,580
My name is Kouya.

117
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,900
But everyone calls me Ham.

118
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,310
Bar customers all want to hear about
my big brother from me.

119
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,000
Just like you.

120
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,730
Huh?

121
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,830
Who?

122
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,710
Big brother's super popular on the island.

123
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,750
Handsome and cool.

124
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,490
Even foreign girls fall for him.

125
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,470
Not just girls.

126
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,650
Big Brother.

127
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,480
Guys are okay, too.

128
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,870
Why tell me this

129
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,050
I thought you were curious.
Not at all.

130
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,810
I'm leaving then.

131
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,150
Wait.

132
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,740
- See, you are curious after all.
- No.

133
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,310
Why do you think I'd be curious?

134
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,250
Well...

135
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,740
I just wanted everyone to know.

136
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,150
Kaishin is the island's specialty.

137
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,690
Ham.

138
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,780
I'm not ordering.

139
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,180
If that guy's the specialty.

140
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,930
This island is doomed.

141
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,480
- Morning, Kaishin.
- Morning.

142
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,860
- Safe walk to school.
- Thank you.

143
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,150
Alright.

144
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,780
Okay.

145
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,820
Fixed it up. Tell me if
the cat breaks it again.

146
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,630
Thanks.

147
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,850
Stay for lunch.

148
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,380
Ah, no thanks!

149
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,770
Not today.

150
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,000
I have a cat at home now.

151
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,510
Good morning.

152
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,710
So bright.

153
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,220
Sun's hitting your butt.

154
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,170
You.

155
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,230
How did you get in?
Hm?

156
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,150
Spare key

157
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,160
I'll report you for trespassing.

158
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,040
No.

159
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,500
This is also my job.

160
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,400
Huh?

161
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,910
Stubborn and moody.

162
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,480
Gets weak and dies when lonely.

163
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,470
So the request I got

164
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,110
is to take care of you day and night.

165
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,140
Don't writers have human rights?

166
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,750
Hand over the key.

167
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,650
Geez.

168
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,650
So pale.

169
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,010
Writers really don't go outside.

170
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,980
Want to see?

171
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,000
Eh?

172
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,780
I can show you.

173
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
So pale!

174
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,490
So pale.

175
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,850
Huh?

176
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,680
So smooth.

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,870
Hair removal?

178
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,980
Or laser?

179
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,290
Does it itch after?

180
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,020
When I had it done.

181
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,090
It was so itchy.

182
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,380
Excuse me.

183
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,500
Eh?

184
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,970
Wow! Like a peeled pear!

185
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,360
This is like an apple.

186
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,290
Do you have a fever?

187
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,910
Take medicine if you feel bad.

188
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,360
Don't you feel anything?

189
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,120
Nothing at all?

190
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,680
What?

191
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,990
You.
Get out.

192
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,930
Get lost now.

193
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,670
Sorry.

194
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,840
Ai.

195
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,020
Ai-san.

196
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,150
Don't call me.

197
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,950
Sweat stains won't come out.

198
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,690
Said he could handle guys.

199
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,820
Ai.

200
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,120
Even if he were the last man on earth.

201
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,860
Absolutely no!

202
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:49,830
Yes.

203
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,290
Thank you.

204
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,030
Rakumoto has always been in your care.

205
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,050
He is currently writing on the island.

206
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,730
No, next month's book fair is no problem

207
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,170
I'll call back later, sorry.

208
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,980
Thank you for calling.

209
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,740
About the contract

210
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,340
I'll be right back.

211
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,430
Oh no.

212
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,350
Thank you for your support.

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,730
He is writing on the island currently.

214
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,510
Ai isn't there?

215
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,450
When will he be back?

216
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,990
(Himeka Ui)

217
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Himeka-san!

218
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,290
Hey, when will he be back?

219
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,810
Next week

220
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,200
I heard he'll definitely return.

221
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,800
Hmm, I see.

222
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,480
That means Fumi is free.

223
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,390
That's not what I mean.

224
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,490
I'm not that free.

225
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,680
Why not?

226
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,480
Popular writer's not around secretary should be free.

227
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,270
As Ai's friend

228
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,260
I'll give you work in his place.

229
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,020
Spare me

230
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,380
I've said many times I'm the teacher's secretary

231
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,400
- I'm not Himeka-san's secretary.
- Light bulb burned out.

232
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,830
What?

233
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,650
I hate dark rooms.

234
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,410
Change it when you're free.

235
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,270
Why me?

236
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,000
Fumi is Ai's secretary.

237
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,270
Yeah.

238
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,570
So?

239
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,880
Ai owns several houses

240
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,710
I rent from him, too.

241
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,500
When the landlord can't handle it, who should?

242
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,550
No.

243
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,970
Even so.

244
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,140
Contractors are expensive and scary.

245
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,320
What if I get hurt doing it myself.

246
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,470
Himeka-san.

247
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,350
Please get ready.

248
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,500
Can't drill holes in wall decorations.

249
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,030
Please, Fumi.

250
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,290
Island specialty tomorrow's leaf mixed kelp pasta, enjoy.

251
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,850
Leave me alone.

252
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,670
Meow.
Huh?

253
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,890
This won't do.

254
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,570
- I got paid.
- I told you.

255
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,430
Stop using that dialect.

256
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,150
I don't want this either.

257
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,850
Just eat.

258
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,560
Bacon and eggs.

259
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,170
Don't like bacon and eggs either.

260
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,780
Seafood udon noodles.

261
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,530
Too heavy for morning.

262
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,990
If it's salad.

263
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,700
Tasty?

264
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,790
No, thanks.

265
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,360
Since you made it.

266
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,770
You eat the rest.

267
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,000
It's all you can eat.

268
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,610
Lucky.

269
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,420
Ai-san is beautiful and kind.

270
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,130
So nice.

271
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,350
- Pure heart like a white cat.
- How much to shut you up?

272
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,630
Money can't buy me.

273
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,570
Though big money is different.

274
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,840
Huh.

275
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,050
My account.

276
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,620
I thought you weren't interested.

277
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,940
How about 20,000?

278
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,410
Huh?

279
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Can you not talk like that?

280
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,300
30,000

281
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,890
40,000

282
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,730
How about 50,000.

283
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,690
Too cheap for you?

284
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,800
Not at all

285
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,380
20,000 is fine.

286
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,910
Aren't you upset being looked down on?

287
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,960
Not at all?

288
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm happy you'd spend money on me.

289
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,780
That's wonderful, Ai.

290
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,360
You found someone you liked.

291
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,090
Himeka, are you listening?

292
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,490
Because.

293
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,500
If you sleep with that boy, can't you write?

294
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,270
A novelist who can't write love scenes

295
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,730
without passionate nights with new partners.

296
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,580
Who can save him from trouble

297
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,740
is a wild youth raised on the island.

298
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,720
Not bad.

299
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,870
I won't sleep with him.

300
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,070
Huh?

301
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,300
Even though

302
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,360
how do you write without sleeping with others?

303
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,150
I'll find someone else.

304
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,570
Caught by that gaze with tears flowing down tense cheeks.

305
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,290
Suddenly I felt a deep pain in chest.

306
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,640
Mysteriously confused.

307
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,720
Why want to hold that slender waist.

308
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,830
Why can't resist this person's tears.

309
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,940
What is love?

310
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,030
Philosophy?
You're so noisy.

311
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,670
Get out, I'm working.

312
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,160
Hey!

313
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,690
Take a little break.

314
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,560
Is this part of the job, too?

315
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,310
Yeah.

316
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,960
Resting is a living being's duty.

317
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,690
Dangerous to fall.

318
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,620
I'm not a child.

319
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,010
Hey, Fumi?

320
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,380
Hello.

321
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,640
Can't hear.

322
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,010
We're at sea.

323
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,110
No signal here.

324
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,980
Shut up.

325
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,910
I'm being nice telling you.

326
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,760
Fumi?

327
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,210
I can't hear you!

328
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,520
Text me if you can.

329
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,690
Can't hear.

330
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,810
Did you hear?

331
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,400
Ah!

332
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,680
Can't hear you!

333
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,580
Hey!!

334
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,270
No way.

335
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,370
Hey! Guide.

336
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,040
Did that idiot fall into the sea?

337
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,150
Kaishin.

338
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,240
Kai~shin~.

339
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,380
Kaishin.

340
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,280
Kaishin.

341
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,440
No way.

342
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,800
Ai-san

343
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,610
I just caught this, let's eat together when we get back.

344
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,180
What's wrong?

345
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,340
Are you crying?

346
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:00,880
Why?

347
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,620
So annoying.

348
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,870
Because I suddenly disappeared.

349
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,880
You were on the phone

350
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,530
so I didn't tell you.

351
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,130
I was rude.

352
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,640
You'd be angry again.

353
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,450
I'm sorry.

354
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,600
Sorry.

355
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,670
Don't cry.

356
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,070
Wipe your tears.

357
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,800
I thought you fell in the sea.

358
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,410
Maybe never coming back.

359
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,810
You might die.

360
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,470
No matter how annoying you are.

361
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,440
I don't want to see you die.

362
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,170
Even if you

363
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,330
died of a heart attack

364
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,580
I'd want to see it myself.

365
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,190
Let go.

366
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,860
Sorry.

367
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,870
Your clothes are cold.

368
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,320
I won't run off again.

370
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,970
Don't worry.

371
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,580
Here.

372
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,690
This

373
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,660
for your swollen eyes.

374
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,040
Nobody asked you.

375
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,450
Right

376
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,740
I didn't ask Ai-san either

377
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,230
to cry for me.

378
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,240
Why are you undressing?

379
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,740
Because they are wet.

380
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,070
Who told you to jump in?

381
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,130
I wanted to show you something nice.

382
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,000
I meant the turban shells.

383
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,320
Which would you rather eat?

384
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,840
Shut up.

385
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,300
Though

386
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,860
I can probably guess.

387
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,700
- What you want to eat is...
- Narcissist.

388
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,830
Can't help being too handsome

389
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,230
I'm the handsome one!

390
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,820
I admit that.

391
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,380
Hey.
Which one?

392
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,060
Turban shells.

393
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:48,900
Or.

394
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,050
Kaishin.

395
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,470
So

396
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,360
weird name.

397
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,740
What's the origin?

398
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,050
What about Ai-san's?

399
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,730
Your name is special.

400
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,860
I asked first.

401
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,830
Because it matches your name.

402
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,240
What?

403
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,120
Is there something wrong with your Japanese?

404
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,180
How does it match?

405
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,720
Someday.

406
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,180
You'll fall in love with the ocean.

407
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,870
Love it from your heart.

408
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,420
You must love the sea from your heart.

409
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,970
How boring.

410
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,840
Love is just delusion.

411
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,120
I'm hungry.

412
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,200
What you mentioned.

413
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,360
Turban shells.

414
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,820
Hurry and make them.

415
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,640
Got it.

416
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,740
Come.
Stand up.

417
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,860
I can stand by myself.

418
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,110
Don't pull me.

419
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,060
You're really shy.

420
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,380
What?

421
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,720
Meow.

422
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,500
Stop the dialect.

423
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,350
It's a cat.

424
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,250
Meow.

425
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,890
Want to see?

426
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
I can show you.

427
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,520
I want to see.

428
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,670
Huh.

429
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,670
It's a dream
