1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,160
I'll go do the final venue check

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,690
I'll come get you later.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,490
Noted.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,630
Come in.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,030
Yaho.. Brother.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,780
What a surprise

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,130
I'm having my book signing here tomorrow, too.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,520
You're not copying me, are you?

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,590
Showing up the day before the event.

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,390
You seem quite free.

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,160
Really.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,310
That's so mean

13
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,250
I specially came to say hi during recon.

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,110
Sign my book when I buy it later.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,200
I didn't ask you to sit.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,550
Not saying "please sit" is rude.

17
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,710
But it can't be helped.

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,370
Given your upbringing.

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,030
Is that the only line you've got?

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,850
Heartless father.

21
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,500
Man-buying mother, and me craving love.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,820
Aren't you tired of that yet?

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,610
You're also a writer.

24
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,810
Come up with some newer material.

25
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,520
Hmm...

26
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,140
You are right about that.

27
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,210
Your family's collapse is well-known.

28
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,180
So then...

29
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,450
The son of a man-buying mother

30
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,100
grows up to buy young men, too?

31
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,880
Someone bought with money could never love you.

32
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,050
Oh my?

33
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,050
Did I hit a nerve?

34
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,760
If you're done talking...

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,860
Not yet.

36
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,700
Let's be real.

37
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,550
It's just an obsessive father complex.

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,100
Seeking comfort from men.

39
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,550
In the end, the son gets abandoned, too.

40
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,590
How about an ending
where he gets dumped and goes insane?

41
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,240
Ai Rakumoto's signature.

42
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,350
Ultra-miserable romantic tragedy.

43
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,270
Rejected.

44
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,800
If you want me to lose my temper
and throw water on you.

45
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,810
Think a bit harder.

46
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,870
I agree.

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,100
What?

48
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,150
Are you grabbing my hand and force me to splash you?

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,070
No.

50
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,830
This way...

51
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,660
is much simpler.

52
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,560
What happened?

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,450
Brother...

54
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,010
Brother, why did you do this?

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,850
I was just worried about you.

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,650
Why do you always...

57
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,070
resort to violence when upset?

58
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,270
Teacher Ai, what happened...?

59
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,270
Get a towel first.
Yes!

60
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,300
It's all right.

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,190
This is a family matter.

62
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,610
He's been jealous of me since we were kids.

63
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,170
But...

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,610
I've never hated my brother.

65
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,520
Today

66
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,130
I only came to congratulate him.

67
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,200
Even if it's a family business

68
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,640
it's still violence.

69
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,760
Teacher.

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm sorry, I must call the police...

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,190
Please wait.

72
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,630
There must be a misunderstanding

73
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,530
I did it.

74
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,580
No.

75
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,820
Correction. I'm about to do it now.

76
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,530
Teacher.

77
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,280
Since I'll be blamed anyway.

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,460
Might as well actually do it.

79
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,010
What do you mean?

80
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,750
You know what this is?

81
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,700
Huh?

82
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,640
Acting like you're having breakdown?

83
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,810
I agree.

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,700
What? Are you grabbing my hand
and force me to splash you?

85
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,690
Stop.

86
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,490
No~ This way...

87
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,960
- is much simpler.
- Stop it!

88
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,940
It's not like that.

89
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,810
Ah.
This is...

90
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,380
I've been framed.

91
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,630
Let me teach you one more thing.

92
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,510
Use your brain.

93
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,830
Is everything settled?

94
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,060
Yeah.

95
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,350
It was exhausting though.

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,460
Good boy.

97
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,750
You're so clever.

98
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,620
Really.

99
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,650
Earlier.

100
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,840
I met Ai-san's cousin.

101
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,620
Huh?

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,280
She said she wanted to buy me.

103
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,700
I thought if I accepted,
I might learn her true intentions.

104
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,550
But I don't want to deceive you,
not even for a second.

105
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,830
So I turned her down.

106
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,820
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,330
Knowing that is enough.

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,130
Next

109
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,400
we'll use this.

110
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,010
To stab someone?

111
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Of course not.

112
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,800
This recorder pen was a birthday gift from Himeka.

113
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,130
For self-defense.

114
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,600
Self-defense...

115
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,490
While protecting ourselves

116
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,690
expose the real conspiracy.

117
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,700
Love Sea: The Home for Lovers
(Episode 8)

118
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,660
Thank you.

119
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,610
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

120
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,200
Please! I'm a huge fan! Ever since the yakuza series.

121
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,610
Wow.

122
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,500
- Since that early?
- Yes.

123
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,740
Thank you.

124
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,080
Which character is your favorite?

125
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,080
The main character—the cowardly, shameless handsome guy.

126
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,910
What a joy!

127
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,580
There you go.

128
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,440
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

129
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,820
My name is Yuri.
Nice to meet you, Yuri.

130
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,880
Teacher Beppu.

131
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,660
Your signing event tomorrow is cancelled.

132
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,770
Why?

133
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,520
You're asking why?

134
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,550
Who is this?

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,000
[Link to a disturbing video]
(Message: Too much. Rin pissed?)

136
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:08,500
(Is this a joke?)

137
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,880
This way...

138
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,440
is... much simpler.

139
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,500
What...

140
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,660
How did this get leaked?

141
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,840
One of you must have done it.

142
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,010
Huh?
(Message: Terrible, explain this)
(Message: Forget it, no point, let's break up!)

143
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,450
You've got to be kidding me.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,320
Give back my 50 million!!

145
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,820
What a shame.

146
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,170
- Too bad I missed all the fun.
- Not fun at all.

147
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,390
Media inquiries are flooding in.

148
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,770
And on top of that, so is this...

149
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,370
This?

150
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,460
After all

151
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,860
it's too hard for an amateur.

152
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,060
Using someone like me for practice.

153
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,500
That's because Fumi said...

154
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,020
to be grateful for the recorder pen.

155
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,650
Well...

156
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,910
- I just said to show gratitude...
- It's fine.

157
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,910
It's easier than changing a lightbulb, isn't it?

158
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,600
No way...

159
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,550
I can't teach you If you run away.

160
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,270
See

161
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,360
these are the stage directions.

162
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,990
In other words, the actor's movements.

163
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,030
And

164
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,210
these are the lines.

165
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,540
Take this for example

166
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,110
there are about twenty scenes in total.

167
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,760
Eh, all of them?

168
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,250
No, just practice the scenes with the two.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,910
For instance.

170
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,860
Hesitating.

171
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,250
Gently approaching.

172
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,810
Yuka grips her hand tightly.

173
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,970
Honestly.

174
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,970
Should I admit it?

175
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,650
To this love...

176
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,520
I'm already deeply trapped.

177
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,740
Hold my hand back.

178
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,900
I'm still...

179
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,510
haven't memorized lines, I'm useless

180
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,670
I'll memorize them properly next time.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,990
Good work.

182
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,500
You, too.

183
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,530
Are you going to bed?

184
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,270
Good night.

185
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,630
- Aren't you going to sleep?
- No, I'm also...

186
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,610
Sleep in my bed.

187
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,840
Huh?

188
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,320
Can I?

189
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,450
I really wanted to sleep though...

190
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,820
Sorry.

191
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,030
Because it was so comfortable

192
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,900
8 points.

193
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,120
Huh?

194
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,670
You mean my bed skills?

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,800
No.

196
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,310
It's your score

197
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:40,900
8 points.

198
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,150
Out of 100.

199
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,310
That's failing.

200
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,540
Because I like the number 8.

201
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,540
What's that about?

202
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,530
Ai-san.

203
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,670
Something I want to show you.

204
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,970
Handmade crafts...?

205
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,290
Made at the island workshop?

206
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,500
Yes.

207
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,090
These are all...

208
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,540
accessories made from recycled materials.

209
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,670
I co-own a shop with a Thai person.

210
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,950
I spent years balancing design and cost.

211
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,640
We're finally ready to sell soon.

212
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,870
So cute.

213
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,500
Girls would love these.

214
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,260
What about you?

215
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,660
Do you like it?

216
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,290
I do.

217
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,440
Very cute.

218
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,480
I also like Ai-san.

219
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,870
I meant the bracelet.

220
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,120
I always...

221
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,800
wanted to live on that island...

222
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,000
and develop eco-friendly tourism.

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,780
It's been my dream since before.

224
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,340
What about now?

225
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,020
Now...

226
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,430
I'm kind of...

227
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,030
starting to feel confused.

228
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,770
Because I have someone important.

229
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,910
No need to be confused.

230
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,100
Huh?

231
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,240
Dreams should be fulfilled.

232
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,480
Haven't you always worked for this?

233
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,410
I'm getting up early, going to sleep.

234
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:43,620
Huh?

235
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,420
Where are you going tomorrow?

236
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,840
None of your business.

237
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,380
Are you going out today, too?

238
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,480
Where are you going?

239
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,180
None of your business.

240
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,200
Wait.

241
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,410
Answer me before you leaving

242
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,600
I'll say it again...

243
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,410
None of your business.

244
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,560
Is this something appropriate to discuss with a kid?

245
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,870
Who else can I talk to?

246
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,810
Having no friends is kind of a turn-off.

247
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,050
Ah.

248
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,510
Maybe he's tired of you?

249
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,720
Impossible.

250
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,350
What makes you so confident?

251
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,250
Uncle Ai...

252
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,900
is charming and popular...

253
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,060
Any newcomer won't let him go.

254
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,520
Even so, it's impossible.

255
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,440
Kids might not understand.

256
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,810
I'm also pretty...

257
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,440
charming, you know.

258
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,710
You're only about ten years older than me.

259
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,030
To Uncle Ai, you are like a kid.

260
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,530
You're kidding me.

261
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,110
There must be a mistake.

262
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,560
It's a bit different...

263
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,890
It's been so long.

264
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,620
Long time no see.

265
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,120
Good to know you're doing well.

266
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,670
Uncle Shusaku.

267
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,990
To be honest, right now

268
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,330
I'm troubled about your son.

269
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,000
I saw that video, even I barely go online.

270
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,020
It must've been rough.

271
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,040
Thanks to him, my book publication almost got cancelled...

272
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,530
My mom also scolded me a lot.

273
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,230
So...

274
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,150
The reason I called today...

275
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,120
is about those photos I sent you.

276
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,820
Everyone looks lovely.

277
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,550
And...

278
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,170
this man...

279
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,310
is the one who picks up Mina.

280
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,740
Is he a servant?

281
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,000
No.

282
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,590
He lives with Ai.

283
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,530
Probably his lover.

284
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,280
Suppose so...

285
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,570
Oh.

286
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,590
I'll get straight to the point.

287
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,330
I don't care how you do it.

288
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,650
Please take away what's important to Ai...

289
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,710
and make him despair.

290
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,780
Well...

291
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,440
I am Ai's father.

292
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,180
As for payment...

293
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,460
Name your price.

294
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,410
Where are you going?

295
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,240
None of your business.

296
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,140
Ai-san.

297
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,650
Answer me.

298
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,920
The contract states clearly.

299
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,270
You have no right to interfere.

300
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,440
Whoever I sleep with...

301
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,930
is none of your business.

302
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,130
Hey.

303
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,490
What are you doing?

304
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,490
The contract doesn't say...

305
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,700
that I can't make a move on you.

306
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,780
I don't want to...

307
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,490
I don't have time for that.

308
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,960
Hold me.

309
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
You're quite confident.

310
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,670
How many times do we have to sleep together...

311
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,050
to understand what love is?

312
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,690
The one thing I don't get...

313
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,100
is you.

314
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,180
So then

315
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,680
what about your feelings?

316
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,900
Tell me.

317
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,700
Hey you.
Stage direction.

318
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,170
Shouldn't you embrace me here?

319
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,370
Do we really need to go that far?

320
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,400
Just a hug, what are you hesitating?

321
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,180
Okay.

322
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,700
Please just do the final scene.

323
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,310
Scene 16.

324
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,950
The climax scene for two.

325
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,320
Caressing Yuka's cheek.

326
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,530
"Can I love you?"

327
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,050
"Just this once."

328
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,580
Smiling.

329
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,490
Yuko kisses her.

330
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,190
Only one line.

331
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,250
But...

332
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,870
it's a crucial, emotionally climax.

333
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,720
Give it everything you've got.

334
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,450
It's just one line.

335
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,080
Say the line, and then done.

336
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,540
But...

337
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,200
- We're not really kissing, right?
- Just say your line.

338
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,670
"Can I love you?"

339
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,760
"Just this"

340
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,500
"once."

341
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,040
Look into my eyes.

342
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,840
Himeka-san, I really... I can't.

343
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,690
Love me.

344
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,290
Fumi, I...

345
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,290
Himeka-san

346
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,450
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,150
This is just a rehearsal.

348
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,260
Sorry.

349
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,630
Fumi.

350
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,190
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,580
Fumi.

352
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,420
Whoa!

353
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,440
- Welcome back, Mina.
- I'm here.

354
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,690
Hey.

355
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,990
Things seem to be going well.

356
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,290
Are you guys over your rough patch?

357
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,180
What? We never had a rough patch to begin with.

358
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,310
Ah.

359
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Ai might be playing hot and cold from falling into a rut.

360
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,310
What is that? That's adorable!

361
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,160
I could totally see that.

362
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,710
You all look happy.

363
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,190
Mind if I join you?

364
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,600
You've grown up, Mina.

365
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,140
Do you remember me?

366
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,030
It's been a long time since we met last time.

367
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,130
Wait...

368
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,640
We met recently, didn't we?

369
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,790
If you hadn't run away.

370
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,690
Thanks for telling Mom and Uncle Ai.

371
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,320
Thanks to you, they contacted me.

372
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,550
I ran away on purpose.

373
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,160
My apologies. I was just overjoyed
to see my granddaughter again.

374
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,300
I'm Mina's Grandfather.

375
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,170
Ai's father.

376
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,950
My name is Shusaku.

377
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,390
And you?

378
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,390
I'm Kaishin.

379
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,120
Kaishin.

380
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,040
So we finally meet.

381
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,040
Do you know me?

382
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,520
I do.

383
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,180
Hope you don't mind.

384
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,200
Just...

385
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,720
I can't help but be curious

386
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,050
about the people around my kids.

387
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,920
From your reaction

388
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,160
you must have heard about me.

389
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,560
That's all in the past.

390
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,240
I caused those kids much trouble

391
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,260
I failed them as a father.

392
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,180
I regret it.

393
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,920
Missing my precious children's growth.

394
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,570
I want to ask one thing about you.

395
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,910
Why were you waiting here?

396
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,500
What is your purpose?

397
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,080
Purpose.

398
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,440
I want you out of Ai's life.

399
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,260
Why?

400
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,570
Didn't I say?

401
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,600
I have my regrets.

402
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,560
I intend to fulfill my duties as a father.

403
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,060
Trying to act like a father now.

404
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,650
What's that got to do with us?

405
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,150
No, deep down you know it yourself.

406
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,850
You're not good enough for Ai.

407
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,160
Honestly

408
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,650
you don't understand Ai at all, do you?

409
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,270
That's understandable.

410
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,040
After all, you're from completely different worlds.

411
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,210
Kaishin.

412
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,790
Let's go back.

413
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,670
Kaishin.

414
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,950
I was in your situation before.

415
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,470
So I get it.

416
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,470
If you truly care about Ai

417
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,580
you'll listen to

418
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,170
what I am saying.

419
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,240
Goodbye.

420
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,130
This is all my fault.

421
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,470
Huh?

422
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,730
I thought I could handle it alone.

423
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,010
But...

424
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,720
I was wrong.

425
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,910
Grandpa completely outsmarted me.

426
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,770
It's not your fault.

427
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,250
That bast...

428
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,670
There's something wrong with your grandfather.

429
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,450
There was no way

430
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,030
you could've predicted his thoughts.

431
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,810
Uncle Kaishin.

432
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,460
You won't disappear from Ai, will you?

433
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,160
No.

434
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,590
I won't.

435
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,400
Then...

436
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,990
don't tell Ai or my mom about today.

437
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,010
I don't want them to be hurt.

438
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,730
Let's pretend nothing happened.

439
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,720
- But...
- Please.

440
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,570
Please.

441
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,730
Kaishin.

442
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,550
You...

443
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,370
How long will you be timid?

444
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,570
Even if you say that

445
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,560
I can't help it.

446
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,640
Ah, just leave me alone!

447
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,330
That was brilliant.

448
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,190
Very soulful performance.

449
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,400
Really?

450
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,940
Say it again.

451
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,330
Eh, I don't want to.

452
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,270
Himeka-san, you do it.

453
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,760
Hey, no way I'm doing it.

454
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,670
Leave me alone!

455
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,450
You are so adorable
