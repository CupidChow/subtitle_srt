1
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,030
Sorry to keep you waiting.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,820
Watching the sea?

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,570
What else is there to do?

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,490
I am curious about Ai-san

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,520
I've only seen two faces.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,770
Arrogant and helpless.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,610
- Who's helpless?
- Just saw the third, angry face.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,380
I'm going back.

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,940
Not eating the shells.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,980
I changed my mind.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,080
Leave me alone.

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,620
Can't do that.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,130
I'm a professional guide.

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,740
Taking care of you and reading your mood is my job.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,440
Help you bathe.

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,240
Wash your hair.

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,310
You came to the island

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,070
to write a novel, right?

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,920
So what?

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,890
I'll show you around this island.

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,180
Not just the sea

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,650
I know everything on land, too.

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,120
Reassuring, right?

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,400
But I didn't ask you

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,560
I already got paid by the editor.

26
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,880
Take money, do work.

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,280
If I can't do it
I have to refund.

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,150
Really?

29
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,660
Then refund it now.

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
But...

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,830
I already turned down other jobs for this.

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,820
Might not have work now.

33
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,210
By the way.

34
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,720
No car rental on the island, only scooters.

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,090
Without me

36
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,700
you can't go anywhere.

37
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,520
I'm your

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,290
babysitter and guide.

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,870
And also...

40
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,770
Want to add any other options?

41
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,590
Up to you.

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,350
I think I kinda want it.

43
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,540
Even if you were the last man on earth.

44
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,590
Absolutely no way.

45
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,510
Let's eat the shells.

46
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,850
Good food calms anger.

47
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,010
Open your mouth.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,270
Eat with your hands

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,370
I already washed them.

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,970
Dip your hands in the sea.

51
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,380
- That's not the same as washing.
- Seawater kills germs.

52
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,500
It's delicious, eat up.

53
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,670
Please.

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
You know?

55
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,910
What I wanted to do when we first met?

56
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,400
Annoy me or something like that.

57
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,690
I really wanted to know

58
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,810
what these little lips

59
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,380
taste like.

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,600
Want to know?

61
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Ouch.

62
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,860
Let me see.

63
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,730
Gentle.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,940
Cut by shell fragments.

65
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,510
Be careful when I'm not around.

66
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,420
No next time

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,980
I'll get disinfectant.

68
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,050
Need to find someone tonight.

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,200
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 2)

70
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,010
Please.

71
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,110
Answer the phone.

72
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,880
Please pick up the phone.

73
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,520
Hello.

74
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,620
This is Ai Rakumoto.
Hello.

75
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,800
Please tell Himeka-san to stop ordering me around

76
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,140
I currently cannot take calls.

77
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,170
Please contact Secretary Fumi

78
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,600
if anything happens.

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,560
What to do.

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
I just have to go.

81
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,160
Took 30 minutes to prepare yourself?

82
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,550
Why?

83
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,640
I just have to go.

84
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,070
Go and it's solved.

85
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,350
Start and it'll end

86
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,430
whatever it is.

87
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,880
You must be tired.

88
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,050
Come rest inside.

89
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,790
Ah.

90
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,930
But.

91
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,520
Light bulb.

92
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,080
I just came to change the bulb

93
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,340
I'll leave right after.

94
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,820
The novelist won't answer calls, such a free secretary.

95
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,410
Supporting his writing.

96
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,310
It is my job.

97
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,080
Is he even writing?

98
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Probably still sleeping.

99
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,430
Maybe sleeping with someone.

100
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,320
He isn't that kind of person.

101
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,510
Anyway, just come in.

102
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,490
Excuse me.

103
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,630
It hurts.

104
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,480
Be gentle.

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,960
Alright, it's done.

106
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,380
Still hurts.

107
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,630
Pain, pain, go away

108
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,880
I'm not a child.

109
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,250
You make such a fuss over a tiny cut.

110
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,470
Just a tiny...

111
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,010
Then a different spell.

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,240
My hands... are dirty.

113
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,800
Does Ai-san have dirty parts?

114
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,380
I want to

115
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,640
sleep with you.

116
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,650
Here

117
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,360
is the bed.

118
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,160
Open your mouth.

119
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,810
I want to keep going.

120
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,000
Ah! Wait.

121
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,300
Kaishinn.

122
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,340
Take me back to the inn now.

123
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,600
What?

124
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,630
My technique has gotten rusty.

125
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,810
Popular with women.

126
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,190
Such an cute side.

127
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,310
Be quiet.

128
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,510
Okay.

129
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,610
Touching your shoulder.

130
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,150
Reminds me of someone.

131
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,750
Turn on the light please.

132
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,090
It's on.

133
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,870
Great.

134
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:11,440
Well then

135
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,520
I'm heading back.

136
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,800
Wait.

137
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,190
What is it?

138
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,670
The light is on already.

139
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,350
Such a messy room.

140
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,660
You're leaving me here?

141
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,000
Huh?

142
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,820
This is Himeka-san's house.

143
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,310
Can't help it.

144
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,420
Nonstop filming.

145
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,620
Didn't Ai tell you?

146
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,880
I'm a woman who can't do anything

147
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,220
I've heard of it.

148
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,370
But I need to memorize lines.

149
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,410
Hope you'll help me rehearse.

150
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,440
I can't do that

151
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,200
I'm just an amateur.

152
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,910
Then.

153
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,800
Fumi.

154
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,880
What can you help me with?

155
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,480
Okay.

156
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,530
Hmm?

157
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,630
It's mine.

158
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,030
I want to clean around the sofa, too.

159
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,810
Well

160
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,810
I'll be in my room, call if needed.

161
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,170
What's that?

162
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,650
Fire-resistant Stone.

163
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,560
Rare stone formed by island's volcanic eruption.

164
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,930
Soft and light, yet very strong.

165
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,580
Wow.

166
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:20,940
Here.
Ai-san.

167
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,150
Really.

168
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,740
This heart

169
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,490
is really super light.

170
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,290
But very strong.

171
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,620
Oh, right.

172
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,180
Let me show you something nice.

173
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,120
Too tight?

174
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,450
Very tight.

175
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,820
Bear with it.

176
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,750
Let's go.

177
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,730
Get on.

178
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,980
Wait...

179
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,350
This outer wall is all made of fire-resistant stone, too.

180
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,800
(Sandy Path)

181
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,620
Nice, right?

182
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,700
Yeah.

183
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,390
This statue is, too.

184
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,020
Huh?

185
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,440
Is this graffiti?

186
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:54,950
Yeah.

187
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,590
Because it's soft and easy to carve,
tourists used to scratch it up.

188
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,350
Not only fire-resistant stone

189
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,240
but also everything on the island is precious.

190
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,120
I want to protect them from harm.

191
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,860
We're here.

192
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,000
Not getting off?

193
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,980
It hurts.

194
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,500
Where?

195
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,590
Where does it hurt?

196
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,880
Ow!

197
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,620
My butt.

198
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,040
My butt hurts.

199
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,910
Your riding is rough.

200
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,950
I'll be gentle tonight (dialect)

201
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:50,910
Huh?

202
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,660
Island people might see.

203
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,970
Scared?

204
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,580
Of being seen with a man.

205
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,190
No.

206
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,210
I'm not hiding.

207
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:06,810
But.

208
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,570
Kaishin is a local, right?

209
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,680
I don't care what others think.

210
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,410
I see.

211
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,520
However

212
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:18,980
what did you just say.

213
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,730
I said.

214
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,890
I'll be gentle tonight.

215
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,640
It... hurts...

216
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,500
Delicious.

217
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,220
Right?

218
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,890
Island specialty, red curry with black curry.

219
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,050
Specialty.

220
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,130
Hmm?

221
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,280
On the first day, your brother

222
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,540
told me.

223
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,770
The island specialty is Kaishin.

224
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,640
Ham said something dumb again.

225
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,480
- Wasn't wrong though.
- Even Amy-san is teasing me.

226
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,360
No.

227
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,450
You love this island, and the sea.

228
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,490
Environmental and linguistic, all is completely self-taught.

229
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,020
Weird, right?

230
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,900
Still teasing me.

231
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,780
You've got various certifications

232
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,500
made the tourists happy.

233
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,920
We benefit a lot.

234
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,340
What supports this place is the food.

235
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,340
That's true, too.

236
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,010
Geez.

237
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,540
Suddenly want to show off.

238
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,700
What do you want to eat?

239
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,800
Island-style Peperoncino.

240
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,620
Want island-style?

241
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,710
After eating my island-style pasta, you won't want anything else.

242
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,930
Be prepared.

243
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Thanks.

244
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,150
Huh.

245
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,820
Staring like that, are you in love?

246
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,290
When did you start guiding?

247
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,600
Hmm.

248
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,970
It started at 15

249
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,310
15 years old?

250
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,400
Amazing.

251
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,210
Do your parents do it, too?

252
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,370
No.

253
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,720
I fought with my parents

254
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,200
and left home at 15, cut ties with them.

255
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,690
Huh?

256
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,260
So.

257
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,580
Not just a tour guide

258
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,260
I do anything that pays

259
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
to survive.

260
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,510
Amy said nice things in front of customers.

261
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
She even lent me money

262
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,090
at the day I got certified.

263
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,160
You probably think I'm pitiful.

264
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,650
If Ai-san thinks so, then I really am.

265
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,350
But I don't see it that way myself.

266
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,940
I don't think so either.

267
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,910
Thank you.

268
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,490
Why did Ai-san become a writer?

269
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,110
Because it was fun.

270
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,520
At first.

271
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,910
I wanted to share things I liked

272
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,470
with others.

273
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,060
Now?

274
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,210
Well.

275
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,710
As readers increased

276
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,980
some started to criticizing.

277
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,780
"This setting is weird."

278
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,310
"Not well thought out, what's the motivation?"

279
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,060
Does Princess Kaguya need a reason to be born from bamboo?

280
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,720
That's the world of creation.

281
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,470
Is your current work fulfilling?

282
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,130
Otherwise, there wouldn't be a writer Ai Rakumoto.

283
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,680
Amazing.

284
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,580
You're amazing.

285
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,360
Never been praised me like that

286
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,420
I'll praise you.

287
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,050
I think Kaishin is amazing, too.

288
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,820
Really a specialty.

289
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,360
Hey.

290
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,660
Eat up.

291
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,320
It'll get cold.

292
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,140
Delicious.

293
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,820
So delicious.

294
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,000
So cute.

295
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,590
(Dialect)

296
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,350
Hmm?

297
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,390
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

298
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,960
Himeka-san

299
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,630
I've washed 3 weeks' worth of clothes

300
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,360
and vacuumed

301
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,860
I'll take my leave now.

302
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:50,930
Wait.

303
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,180
Don't tell me I have to wash dishes, too.

304
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,720
Already washed.

305
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,510
Stomach.

306
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,330
Himeka-san.

307
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:07,960
Are you okay?

308
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,470
Himeka-san.

309
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,660
I'm hungry.

310
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,860
I only had water and an apple.

311
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,160
Order delivery

312
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,920
I don't have strength to pick up phone.

313
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,020
No energy to even go get it.

314
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,270
But you still have strength to pull my arms.

315
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,740
I understand

316
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,600
I'll order delivery

317
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,230
I'll leave once it arrives.

318
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,750
What do you want? Let's eat together.

319
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,390
Order for two.

320
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,430
Okay.

321
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,750
This time

322
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,220
I really have to go now.

323
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:23,990
Wait.

324
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,910
Is there anything else?

325
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,250
Light bulbs, laundry, cleaning.

326
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm not Himeka-san's servant.

327
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,050
Ai is better.

328
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,850
He orders his own delivery.

329
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,970
Fumi.

330
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,070
No other requests.

331
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,290
Just want to give you a reward.

332
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,490
A reward.

333
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,240
Don't tell me it's cleaning toilets.

334
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,690
The reward for an excellent secretary

335
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,280
is a kiss from the leading lady.

336
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,550
Bye!

337
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,530
Why the sudden heavy rain?

338
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,650
Island gets sudden showers.

339
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,790
Taking shelter here?

340
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,060
- Let me borrow the shower.
- Ok.

341
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,340
Clean clothes with bigger size are left outside.

342
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,390
Viewing requires a fee.

343
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,050
The service in day

344
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,000
was not for free.

345
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,730
How much?

346
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,750
How much was it for that in day?

347
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,140
How much to sleep with you once?

348
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,420
Being violated by you.

349
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,260
How much do I have to pay for it?

350
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,710
How much would it cost to have you?

351
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,550
I'm expensive.

352
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,000
I can afford it.

353
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,470
You're good at biting.

354
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,880
It feels so good.

355
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,590
Condom

356
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,490
in my bag.

357
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:22,180
Which way did you toss?

358
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,270
Wait.

359
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,460
Have you been staring too much?

360
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,170
Huh?

361
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,300
Lines.

362
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,800
Give me a second

363
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,370
I need to use the restroom.

364
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,660
Okay
