1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Miss you

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Love you

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't want to be separated from you

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
At that moment

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
The old age

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,240
Turned into a magical eye

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,920
Pass through the loneliness to find you

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,040
Wear the most solid gold armor

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,920
Hold the weapon in your hand

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Use all your strength to fight for the most real self

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the tone is

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what the rumors are

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,120
I will definitely be invincible

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't want you to be willing

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Where is the gold?

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,400
In the past, I kept the sweet

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,760
No matter where your heart is

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,080
My heart is here

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
Even if the iron armor is invincible

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm only one you

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Episode 16

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
Qi Qing

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,320
Didn't you promise me to be strong?

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,080
Why did you lock yourself in the room?

33
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,640
This is my business

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,920
It has nothing to do with you

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
I don't need your help

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,640
You go

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,360
Qi Qing

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,920
I don't understand why you have become so arbitrary

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
why

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,880
Because I can't stand such a look

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,360
Penalty

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,480
Fancy

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,400
Happy

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,720
Even sympathy

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,880
I thought I could be very confident

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,840
But I can't

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,440
I don't want to stand in front of others

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,080
Become a random opponent

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,800
Qi Qing, you are beautiful

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Really beautiful

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,000
You have family history

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
And the talent to act

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,720
You have a lot of things that girls want

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,800
I know who encountered this

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,160
It may be hard to get through

56
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,240
But if you keep being so self-reliant

57
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,400
You will never stand up

58
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,680
What do you know?

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,800
I used to stand on the cloud

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,960
Now I'm pushed down by people

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,640
No one can understand my feelings

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,040
You go out

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,640
You go out

64
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,240
You are right

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,560
You were born on the cloud

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,080
But what about her?

67
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,440
This is not what should be done

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,800
Have you ever thought about your opponent, Jin Xi?

69
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Jin Xi?

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,960
She has no mother since childhood

71
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,240
When she was the worst, she slept in the park

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,840
Sleep in the garage

73
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,320
She has nothing

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,400
Only a heart that likes to perform

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,640
Just by this

76
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,320
She started playing chess from the role

77
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,480
Step by step

78
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,160
Finally, there is a person who is out

79
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,880
Now she is hit back to the original form

80
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,960
And you

81
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,560
As long as you say you want to shoot

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,040
There are a lot of people behind you who take the contract and let you sign

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,400
What do you want to say?

84
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,080
I often scold her

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,360
I scold her for being naive and simple

86
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,320
But she has really put in too much effort behind her

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,800
Because of her identity

88
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,080
If she wants to stand on the same stage with you

89
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,320
She has to pay more than you

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,360
Don't make me compare with her

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,440
OK

92
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,080
Just like you said

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,280
You and Jin Xi

94
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,320
Have a cloud-like relationship

95
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,800
She is that mud

96
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,080
The mud that no one can see

97
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,760
But every time she meets a setback

98
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,480
She can climb up again and again

99
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
And you

100
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,920
It seems like a beautiful porcelain

101
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,320
But as long as it is slightly smooth

102
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,480
It will hurt you so much

103
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,880
It will only destroy you

104
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,360
If you have time

105
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,840
I advise you to go see Jin Xi's new work

106
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,560
This time she has fallen into a fight with a pet

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,960
I want you to take a good look

108
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,560
How she plays

109
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,040
Tang Fei

110
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,160
She can't do it herself, no one can save her

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,840
Ji Qing

112
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,560
Take me there

113
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,760
Where?

114
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,560
Where she plays

115
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Go, go now

116
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,280
Jin Xi, the plot is mainly like this

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,040
The heroine, Lin Xiang, adopted a fierce dog

118
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,880
And lived together since then

119
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,480
But later her biological mother

120
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,960
Wanted to take her abroad

121
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,040
So she gave the fierce dog to her friend

122
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,320
When she returned home

123
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Her friend told her that the fierce dog was missing

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,040
When you returned to the old house

125
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,360
You found the fierce dog waiting for you

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,200
There are many people in Japan

127
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,960
Who have touched many people

128
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,640
We are not that ambitious

129
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,760
We just want to remind everyone through this movie

130
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,520
Dog is a human friend

131
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,760
The fierce dog is naughty

132
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,280
It's not easy to film with him

133
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,360
Can you do it?

134
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,560
I'll try, I like him very much

135
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,080
That's good, please

136
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,400
Xiu Xiu, you have to be obedient

137
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,840
You have to act well in the future, do you know?

138
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,480
Xiu Xiu

139
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,520
Miss Jian

140
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,040
Miss Jian, she is afraid of sound

141
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,160
You have to be careful when filming

142
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,520
Xiu Xiu, how about you say hello

143
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,040
Hello

144
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,840
So cute

145
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Will she bite you? Don't tease her

146
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
She won't bite me

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,560
I said I won't let you take this movie

148
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,960
You are still teasing the dog

149
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm really embarrassed

150
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
Come, did you get the needle?

151
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,120
I just got the needle yesterday

152
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,520
Come, give me a hug

153
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,960
Come, Xiu Xiu, be careful

154
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,240
Don't let her bite you

155
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,440
So cute

156
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,640
You are quite funny

157
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,760
Let's film together later, okay?

158
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Okay

159
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,600
Ready

160
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
Action

161
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,000
Xiu Xiu

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,880
Hello

163
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,480
Did you see a white dog with a bell?

164
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
No, I haven't seen it

165
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,080
Thank you

166
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,000
Xiu Xiu

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,160
Xiu Xiu

168
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Xiu Xiu

169
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Xiu Xiu

170
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,080
Xiu Xiu

171
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,560
Where are you going?

172
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,160
I'm so anxious

173
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,600
Do you know I'm very anxious?

174
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,080
You are really a professional actor

175
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,480
You did a great job

176
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,400
But I didn't expect that he would take this kind of movie

177
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,440
He doesn't have any grudge

178
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,160
He is a good actor

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,240
I'm going to punish you

180
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,160
But he doesn't allow you to eat anything

181
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,040
I think people who are kind and kind

182
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,080
can't be bad

183
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,680
Yes

184
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,040
Okay, cut

185
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
Very good

186
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,960
Your Xiu Xiu is so cute

187
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,360
You really work together so well

188
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,080
He is a star dog

189
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,440
So cute

190
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,560
Good boy

191
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,200
Jingxing

192
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,760
The next scene will be you and Xiong Xiong's separate scenes

193
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,840
This is the highlight of this movie

194
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,760
Okay

195
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,960
We have to work hard

196
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,320
Work hard

197
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,360
Okay, everyone

198
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,200
Ready to shoot

199
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,280
Ready to shoot

200
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,600
Run and shoot

201
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,360
Go

202
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,560
I'm counting on you in the future

203
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't you really take him with you?

204
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Xiong Xiong

205
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,960
You have to be obedient to the new owner in the future

206
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480
Thank you

207
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,520
It's okay

208
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,440
Xiong Xiong is so beautiful

209
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
So good

210
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,800
Xiong Xiong

211
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,600
Xiong Xiong

212
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,800
Good cut

213
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,040
Director

214
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,760
I was in a bad mood just now

215
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,240
Can I do it again?

216
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,440
I think it's good

217
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,440
Give me another chance, I will be better

218
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,840
You are really experienced

219
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,560
Okay

220
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,160
Thank you, director

221
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Jingxing

222
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Jingxing

223
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,640
It's ugly, right?

224
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,040
Do you have scars?

225
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,240
They are all beautiful

226
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,480
Really?

227
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,160
Venus has no arms

228
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,320
But the beauty of the silkworm

229
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,480
Will make it more precious

230
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,640
You say so

231
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,040
I am really grateful

232
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,160
What's up?

233
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
This blow

234
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,400
Almost destructive

235
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,320
I saw the online scolding

236
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,560
I also saw the company's desperation

237
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,640
They all let you get out of the entertainment industry

238
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,440
Even so

239
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
Do you have to stick to acting?

240
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Stick

241
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
I like acting

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,760
So even if someone says I have a thick skin

243
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,960
Let me roll

244
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,680
I will stick to it

245
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,680
That's not a movie made like this

246
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
I think it's pretty good

247
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,000
A movie with such a small cost

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,720
Not even a promotion

249
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,600
Not to mention the grudge

250
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,000
Why do you still have to act?

251
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,720
No matter what kind of character

252
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,120
As long as there is a chance to act

253
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,200
I will play

254
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,400
Jingxing

255
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,200
I am different from you

256
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
Never a princess who wants to act

257
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,880
In life

258
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,120
There are actually many people like me

259
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,600
Maybe I have put in effort

260
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
But still being scolded

261
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,480
If it's because someone scolded me

262
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,280
I have a feeling of giving up

263
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,400
I will look down on myself

264
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,840
Since I can't shut others' mouths

265
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,000
I have to do better

266
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,400
Tell them what it means to persist to the end

267
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,960
Jingxing, it's starting again

268
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,400
I'm coming over

269
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,320
How about you?

270
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,600
Have you had enough rest?

271
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,480
When will you start again?

272
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,800
Are you going to hide in the house all the time

273
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
Be a princess

274
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,400
I'm waiting for you to come out and fight with me

275
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,640
Fight

276
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,600
Next season's movie festival

277
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
I may not lose to you

278
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,760
Just based on this movie

279
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,160
My tomorrow starts here

280
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,760
If you still stop before the production

281
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,560
I will surpass you very soon

282
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Come on

283
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,800
Really laugh out loud

284
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
This can start again

285
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,120
Too funny

286
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Xiaoxiao

287
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,120
Help me ask the doctor

288
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,280
I have to do an operation tomorrow

289
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,200
Didn't you say you don't do the operation?

290
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,640
I used to be worried

291
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,040
Even if you do the operation

292
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,120
You can't be perfect

293
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,080
But now I found out

294
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,120
The most terrible thing is not the shortcoming

295
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,600
But to be surpassed by the opponent

296
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Let's go

297
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Let's go

298
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,520
Why are you giving me this gift?

299
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,320
I'm not a woman

300
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,880
This is mine

301
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,080
I know

302
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,960
What are you doing?

303
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
This is what I want to give mom

304
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
You are too much

305
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,920
It's all your fault, you scum

306
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,120
What are you angry about, Xiaoxiao?

307
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
What kind of fans are you?

308
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,960
Do you think you are famous?

309
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,560
Do you think everyone likes you?

310
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,760
I tell you, I hate you the most

311
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,880
Why do you use the mirror

312
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,360
Shoot my sun at your home?

313
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,160
I just use natural light

314
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,040
Who knows you are just opposite

315
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,840
If you don't have me

316
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,760
You are still sleeping on the street

317
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,800
I took you in

318
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,160
Give you a chance and give you a job

319
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,320
I tolerate you again and again

320
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,680
You hate me

321
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,800
What are you doing?

322
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,040
Wake you up, idiot

323
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,560
I don't have such a good suit

324
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
Xiaoxiao, I can't stand it

325
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
Give me

326
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,680
Do you hear me?

327
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,840
I can't stand it

328
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,560
What do you want?

329
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,280
I

330
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,560
Actually you are gentle

331
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,040
And you are kind

332
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,160
Why are you hiding from me?

333
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,960
You see me?

334
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,560
Why are you giving up so easily?

335
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
I told you the reason

336
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,960
Sorry, I have a bad memory

337
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I forgot

338
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,560
Please say it again, can you?

339
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
I ask you, have you ever loved me?

340
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
I have

341
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
I have

342
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
I have

343
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
I have

344
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
I have

345
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
I have

346
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
I have

347
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
I have

348
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
I have

349
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
I have

350
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
I have

351
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
I ask you, have you ever loved me?

352
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Even a little bit

353
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
What do you mean by looking at me like this?

354
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Say something, you are dumb

355
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
This is for you

356
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
And

357
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Thank you

358
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Thank you

359
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
I forgot to remind you

360
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
I am such a petty person

361
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I will give this necklace to another woman

362
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,560
I hope you don't regret it

363
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
I remind you again

364
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
In a few days

365
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
In a few days, you will see me and another woman

366
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Be in love and fall in love

367
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Don't cry alone

368
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
Don't cry alone

369
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Say something

370
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
To escape

371
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
The last laugh

372
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Don't move

373
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Don't touch

374
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Use big smile

375
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
In the past, we were too popular

376
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Too willful

377
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
It's okay

378
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
How did experience

379
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Tell me you will not

380
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
It's okay

381
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
In this sad

382
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
End the past

383
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
End the past

384
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
The last laugh

385
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Pull the car over

386
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
After death

387
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Don't contact each other

388
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I don't want to be separated from you

389
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
The screen I opened

390
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Close us

391
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,560
The last memory

392
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,560
To remember the most boring

393
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Sad story

394
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Remember to start

395
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Love and sadness

396
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Never stop

397
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
And now

398
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
It's also a laugh

399
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Good brother

400
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Good brother

401
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
Mom will definitely come back to pick you up

402
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
You have to act well

403
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,560
I now give you to a sister here

404
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
You are obedient

405
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Come, Xiong Xiong is so good

406
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Come, bye bye to mom

407
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Bye bye

408
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Done

409
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Thank you, see you tomorrow

410
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
See you tomorrow

411
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Thank you

412
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Let's go too

413
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Xiong Xiong

414
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Okay, we should go

415
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
But his master hasn't come to pick him up

416
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
I should come to pick him up later

417
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Who will lose their dog

418
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Xiong Xiong

419
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
Your master will come to pick you up later

420
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Don't be afraid

421
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Be good here

422
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Bye bye

423
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Let's go

424
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Can you do it

425
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
No problem

426
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
We have to go to the producer

427
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Hurry up, let's go

428
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Xiong Xiong, bye bye

429
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,560
I'm still worried about him

430
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
It's okay, let's go

431
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
So far

432
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Looking for the next play's heroine

433
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
You must let her know your strength

434
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Tong Yao will pick up Xiong Xiong?

435
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
That woman is a liar

436
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
What

437
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
I just heard her calling someone

438
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
She said she can't raise a dog

439
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Just throw it away, it's too bad

440
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,560
And I think she's using Xiong Xiong to make a living

441
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
You are not the first person who tried to make a rumor

442
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
You won't be the last

443
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
All these years

444
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,560
I don't know how many people want to use the opportunity to make a fuss

445
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
What daughter, lover

446
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
I believe everyone here

447
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
More or less

448
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Have this experience

449
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Miss Jian

450
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
You are still young

451
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
I don't want to make a fuss

452
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
If you keep pestering

453
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
I will call the police

454
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
To investigate your legal responsibility

455
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Mom

456
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,560
You think you can be an actress like this

457
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
The world is cruel that you can't imagine

458
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
You don't understand anything, how long can you hold on

459
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Good advice to you

460
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Before hitting the south wall

461
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Go back to the old way

462
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
I will never leave

463
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Don't look down on me

464
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
I will prove to you

465
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Your judgment is wrong

466
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
I'm not a waste, I'm not trash

467
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
I'm not looking for you to betray the dragon

468
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Then it's up to you

469
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
But I want to remind you

470
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
From now on, in front of anyone

471
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Don't use my daughter to live

472
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Only Zuo Zuo and Xiao Nian are my children

473
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
As for you

474
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Nothing is you

475
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Mom, you hate me so much

476
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Don't call me mom

477
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
I told you

478
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Mom looks at me like a soldier

479
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
I really don't understand

480
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
How can there be such a cruel mom like you in the world

481
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Now I understand

482
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Actually mom doesn't like you at all

483
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Mom likes that reputation and status

484
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
You are a completely retarded actress

485
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
You are afraid to admit that I lost everything you have now

486
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
You are selfish and hypocritical

487
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
You can do anything for yourself

488
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
You can do anything for yourself

489
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,560
You can do anything for yourself

490
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Go back to the film studio

491
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
We are almost late

492
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Teacher, give me a little more time

493
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Anxin, go back to the film studio

494
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Ok

495
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Xiong Xiong

496
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Jian Xi, good morning

497
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Anxin, hurry

498
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Xiong Xiong, are you ok?

499
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Why didn't her master come?

500
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Take her home

501
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Teacher, wait a minute

502
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Miss Jian

503
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Thank you so much, come and give it to me

504
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Xiong Xiong, good boy

505
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Why are you so late?

506
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm just late, I'm really sorry

507
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Do you know that she has been waiting for you in the rain?

508
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
I'm late because I worked overtime today

509
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Thank you

510
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
You are lying, right?

511
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
I'm not lying

512
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
You have already wanted to send her away

513
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
I'm really too busy with work, I really can't take care of her

514
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,560
When you decide to raise her

515
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
You should be responsible

516
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,560
Dogs are different from people, you still have other friends

517
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
But she only has you

518
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
You want to raise her, you want to send her away

519
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
What's the difference between you and those parents who abandoned their children?

520
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Miss Jian, what are you talking about? I don't understand

521
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Besides, you are going too far

522
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
You are going too far

523
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Have you ever thought about the feeling of being abandoned?

524
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
All day long

525
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
Waiting for that person to come back to pick you up

526
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
One day, ten days, one year, ten years

527
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
In the end, that person never came back

528
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
Do you want to raise her for me?

529
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,560
You don't want to raise her, right?

530
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm not lying to you

531
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Zhensi

532
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
I've been abandoned by my mom since I was a child

533
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
I've been waiting

534
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
I've been waiting

535
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
I've been waiting for a long time

536
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
I don't know what I'm waiting for

537
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Is it that easy to abandon a person?

538
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
I asked myself

539
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Did I do something wrong?

540
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,560
That's why she treated me like this

541
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
I don't know

542
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
I don't know

543
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
I don't know

544
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
I don't know

545
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,560
I don't know

546
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
She treated me like this

547
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
I know I love her

548
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
But I don't dare to love her

549
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
I'm scared

550
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,560
I'm really scared

551
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
What are you scared of?

552
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
I'm scared of being abandoned

553
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
I'm scared of being abandoned like garbage

554
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
I'm scared of being abandoned like garbage

555
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
So I said it first

556
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Let her go

557
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Let her go

558
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
Forget about it

559
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Tomorrow morning

560
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
The sun will rise again

561
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
I don't want to accept

562
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
I finally got you a job

563
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Why don't you accept?

564
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,560
I don't want to accept this kind of boring advertisement

565
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
Why are you looking at me like this?

566
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
I don't care

567
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
I'll take you with me

568
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Wait

569
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Why are you suddenly like this?

570
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
What do I care?

571
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Okay

572
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
I don't care

573
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
Anyway, you finally came back this time

574
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
You can't just leave

575
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Isn't it just an advertisement?

576
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
If you like

577
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Then I'll take it

578
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Really?

579
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Yes

580
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Are you satisfied?

581
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
You are too willful

582
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,560
HAI ....

583
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,680
The score is very high. They say it's very boring.

584
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,960
What? A dog's story?

585
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,680
The dog is very cute. The actress is very good.

586
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,040
Let's just watch this.

587
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,440
That Shen Yan is so fake. She doesn't have any acting skills.

588
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,760
I don't want to watch it. Let's just watch the dog.

589
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,800
Okay.

590
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,360
They don't understand anything.

591
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,160
I don't want to watch it.

592
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,960
Shen Yan!

593
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,680
This is the name that God loves the most.

594
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,760
Not bad.

595
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,920
Thank you, Shen Yan, for bringing the dog down.

596
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,120
The dog will play a role again when he wakes up.

597
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,680
In the dream,

598
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,760
Shen Yan saw,

599
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,800
in the dream,

600
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,640
a thousand eyes.

601
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,640
I've never seen you being dumped by a girl.

602
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,640
It's just a breakup.

603
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,640
With your condition, a bunch of girls are waiting in line.

604
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
It's fine.

605
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Don't mention other girls to me, okay?

606
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Why?

607
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,640
I love her.

608
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
Isn't this a fight?

609
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,640
A single dog doesn't deserve to talk to me about feelings.

610
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Who's a single dog?

611
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,640
I'm a very feminine person, okay?

612
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Then you're a woman-friendly single dog.

613
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
You...

614
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Hello?

615
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
What did you say?

616
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
The King of the Garden?

617
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Yes.

618
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,640
I want to invite you to play the leading role in this movie.

619
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,640
Mr. Han, there are so many leading actors in your company.

620
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Why did you choose us?

621
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
My father has seen Miss Jian's recent movie.

622
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
He was very touched.

623
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
That's why he officially invited me.

624
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,640
After the public film was released, the audience was very happy.

625
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,640
With a small cost, one big move was made.

626
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,640
It's a miracle in the movie industry this year.

627
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
But there's no big movie to give you a big boost.

628
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Don't you think it's weird?

629
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
What are you talking about?

630
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
Your reputation is so bad.

631
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,640
A movie can't get your popularity back.

632
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
What you need is real satisfaction.

633
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Explosive publicity and a huge effect.

634
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
Release the King of the Garden.

635
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
I promise you'll be able to turn the tide.

636
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
You'll be the first line.

637
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Mr. Han, I want to ask you a question.

638
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
You asked me to play this movie.

639
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Do you think I'm the right character?

640
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Or do you think I have a very close relationship with Tang Fei?

641
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
It seems you misunderstood.

642
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Actually, I have no relationship with Tang Fei.

643
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,640
Miss Jian, I think feelings are feelings.

644
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Filming is filming. This should be two different things.

645
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
You're lying.

646
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,640
As far as I know, Shen Yan has already asked to play this movie.

647
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,640
And he gave you a set of five-star photos.

648
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
With this sincerity,

649
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,640
most film companies would choose him.

650
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Mr. Han.

651
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
Mr. Han, he...

652
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Where's my mom?

653
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Please sit.

654
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,640
I'm asking you. Where's my mom?

655
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,640
Tang Fei, I'm warning you. Be polite.

656
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
If you don't answer my question,

657
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,640
I'll let you know what's really rude.

658
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,640
I'll take good care of your mom.

659
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
Where did you take her?

660
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,640
After this movie, your mom will be sent back.

661
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,640
In my dream.

662
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Miss Jian, I've seen all your movies.

663
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Whether it's female role or female role,

664
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
the female lead is the most important.

665
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Every role has blood and flesh.

666
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,640
I don't care what the outside world thinks of you.

667
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,640
I don't care if you're Tang Fei's girlfriend.

668
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,640
I care about whether you can restore the cold and cold Yu Aojun.

669
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,640
Han Zhengde!

670
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Miss Jian, you're not the only female lead in The King of Li Yuan.

671
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
Promise me.

672
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
I promise you.

673
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
No need to be polite.

674
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
I'm a female actor.

675
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
The King of Li Yuan is a good script.

676
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
I have no reason to refuse.

677
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I told you not to rush.

678
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,640
You always say I'm naive and emotional.

679
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Now you're the one who's emotional.

680
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Who you're working with, what movie you're acting in,

681
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
these are not important.

682
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,640
What's important is that this script was written by your mom.

683
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,640
Do you have the heart to give it to someone else?

684
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
I almost forgot.

685
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Shen Lan is the king of the spirit world.

686
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,640
He wants to play a male role as a female.

687
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
It's too difficult for you.

688
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
You're too old.

689
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,640
You don't have the confidence to play a role, right?

690
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Mr. Han, I don't like Tang Fei.

691
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Why don't you use Yang Mingyi from your company?

692
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
He looks better than Tang Fei.

693
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,640
Jianxi, are you crazy?

694
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
You don't want to play a role.

695
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
You don't want to let others play a role.

696
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,640
What do you want?

697
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,640
I think Miss Jian is right.

698
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Her suggestion is very good.

699
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Or let Yang Mingyi play the role.

700
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
I think she's quite suitable.

701
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,640
I tell you, I want this role.

702
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Don't fight with me.

703
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
But you have to make a promise with me.

704
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,640
After the play, let my mom appear in front of me.

705
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Okay, as long as you play, I promise to agree.

706
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Dad.

707
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Thank you, Miss Jian.

708
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
I've read the script.

709
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Tang Fei is indeed the most suitable candidate.

710
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Then, please.

711
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Tang Fei.

712
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
Tang Fei.

713
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Tang Fei.

714
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
What are you doing?

715
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Tang Fei.

716
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Why do you force me to play the role of Li Yuan Zhi?

717
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
This role is very suitable for you.

718
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm not afraid of you.

719
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,640
I'm not afraid of you.

720
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
I'm not afraid of you.

721
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
I'm not afraid of you.

722
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
I'm not afraid of you.

723
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
I'm not afraid of you.

724
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
That's going to be a great opportunity for Li Yuan Zhi.

725
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
This role is very suitable for you.

726
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
That's a good risk for you.

727
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
I've read the script.

728
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
It really suits you.

729
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,640
You were fated to be broken up in the beginning.

730
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Why do you want to guest me now?

731
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Tang Fei.

732
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
This role is really good.

733
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
You always want to have time to find a breakthrough.

734
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
As long as you play the role of Li Yuan Zhi.

735
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Are you afraid that if I don't play the role,

736
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,640
Han Zhengde will change for you at any time?

737
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
I'm not trying to change you.

738
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Of course not.

739
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
I've seen more of the show

740
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
of the King of Li Yuan.

741
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,640
I promised you I'd act.

742
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
But I have a request.

743
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
If I find you

744
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
acting badly on set,

745
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
I have the right to change my character.

746
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,640
Tang Fei!

747
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Jianxi!

748
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
Why don't you listen to me?

749
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Do you care about his acting?

750
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
I don't know

751
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
if I did the right thing or not.

752
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
If I were Tang Fei's mother,

753
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
the author of King of Li Yuan,

754
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
I'd definitely want her to play this role.

755
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
But you're just being nice.

756
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
She's totally not into it.

757
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
And if you do this,

758
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
you'll only push her further and further.

759
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
I'll see how you two work together.

760
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
How is it?

761
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
It's amazing, right?

762
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,640
She's delicate and delicate.

763
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Didn't you read the script?

764
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
You should know

765
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
what kind of person Yu Aojun is.

766
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
She's a beautiful girl

767
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
on stage.

768
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
On stage,

769
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,640
she's a wonderful dancer.

770
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Let me tell you.

771
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
In the era they belonged to,

772
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
they didn't walk like this

773
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
in their age.

774
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Lu Zhou,

775
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
why are you so harsh?

776
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
There are still three months left.

777
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
If you want to play Yu Aojun well,

778
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
you have to start now.

779
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,640
Continue.

780
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
In the chess game,

781
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
you have to stand straight first.

782
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
And then, you have to turn.

783
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Yu Aojun

784
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,820
was born in a family of

785
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,640
a family of scholars.

786
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Unlike the normal people who walk the world,

787
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
from today,

788
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
you'll wear a cheongsam and walk.

789
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Even if you sleep, you'll wear it.

790
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
Until you fully adapt to it.

791
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,640
Lu Zhou, this is not a sleepover.

792
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
Three months left.

793
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,640
But you're too far away from this role.

794
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Tomorrow, I'll find you a teacher

795
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,640
to teach you how to be a professional dancer.

796
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Can three months be enough?

797
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Tell me.

798
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
What kind of role

799
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
do you think Yu Aojun is?

800
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,640
A cold and cold girl.

801
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
That's right.

802
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,640
She's a cool and cool girl.

803
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Her name is Aoxue Hongmei.

804
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
So,

805
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,640
you have to turn yourself into Yu Aojun as soon as possible.

806
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
Otherwise,

807
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
you have no right

808
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,640
to stand on the same stage as Tang Fei.

809
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Tang Fei?

810
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,640
You haven't seen her acting, have you?

811
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,640
I've worked with her.

812
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
Acting in a trash play,

813
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
what kind of acting do you need?

814
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
This time, it's different.

815
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
Her mother's work,

816
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
she'll do her best.

817
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,640
If you don't work hard,

818
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
by then,

819
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
all your glory

820
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,640
will be snatched away by Tang Fei.

821
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Jianxi, work hard.

822
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Snatch Tang Fei's glory away.

823
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,640
You're the heroine.

824
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
I can't do it.

825
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
I don't care what your relationship is.

826
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
But standing on the stage,

827
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
in front of the camera,

828
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
you two are partners.

829
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
You win the audience together.

830
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
At the same time, you're enemies.

831
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,640
Because the real focus

832
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
is only one.

833
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
Please help me cut my hair short.

834
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
Short?

835
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Yes.

836
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
Okay.

837
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Jianxi, what are you doing?

838
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
I want to be a royal army.

839
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Jianxi, thank you.

840
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Thank you.

841
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
Okay.

842
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Jianxi.

843
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Why do you look like

844
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,640
a different person today?

845
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
Don't you think

846
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
this is better than a royal army?

847
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,640
But the crew can do the styling.

848
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,640
You don't have to cut your hair short.

849
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
I have to go to class.

850
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
I have to find the teacher.

851
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,640
I'm sorry.

852
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
I'm sorry.

853
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
I'm sorry.

854
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Wait.

855
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Please leave first.

856
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
I have something to tell my agent.

857
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Okay.

858
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
You drink some water and rest.

859
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Okay.

860
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
What's the situation?

861
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
What's wrong?

862
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Who found this makeup artist?

863
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
The producer.

864
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Let me tell you.

865
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
The producer

866
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
killed the producer.

867
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
And the producer killed the producer.

868
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
What's wrong?

869
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Who found this makeup artist?

870
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
You think my eyebrows are not thick enough?

871
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
He kept adding thick eyebrows.

872
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Do you think eyebrows

873
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
are beautiful

874
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
only when you draw them?

875
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
No.

876
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
He drew them for you.

877
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
Why do you have to change this shape?

878
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
Why are you so afraid

879
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
of changing my eyebrows?

880
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
Are you afraid that I will change my fortune?

881
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
No.

882
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,640
You are afraid of changing my fortune

883
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
and then change your fortune.

884
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Right?

885
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,640
Boss, I'm acting as Shen Lan.

886
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
I know.

887
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Are you going to exaggerate?

888
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
You found a bunch of irresponsible makeup artists

889
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
to draw me.

890
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
How can I go to the studio?

891
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
Do you know how I feel now?

892
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I feel like a special agent.

893
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
I feel like a crowd.

894
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
You just find someone

895
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
to help me with my makeup.

896
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Do you know what makeup is?

897
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
Have you watched the play?

898
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
Have you watched the play?

899
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Do you know the play?

900
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
Go and change people.

901
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
Okay.

902
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
You are still sitting here.

903
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Okay.

904
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
I will go and tell them now.

905
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
I will go and tell them now.

906
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
I will go and tell them now.

907
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
Okay.

908
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
I will go and tell them now.

909
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,640
Okay.

910
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,640
I will go and tell them now.

911
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Okay.

912
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I will go and tell them now.

913
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
Okay.

914
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
I will go and tell them now.

915
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Okay.

916
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,640
I will go and tell them now.

917
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Okay.

918
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
I will go and tell them now.

919
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
Okay.

920
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
I will go and tell them now.

921
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
Okay.

922
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
I will go and tell them now.

923
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Okay.

924
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
I will go and tell them now.

925
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Okay.

926
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
I will go and tell them now.

927
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Okay.

928
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
I will go and tell them now.

929
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Okay.

930
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
I will go and tell them now.

931
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
Okay.

932
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
I will go and tell them now.

933
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
Okay.

934
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
I will go and tell them now.

935
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
Okay.

936
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
I will go and tell them now.

937
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
Okay.

938
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
I will go and tell them now.

939
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Okay.

940
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
I will go and tell them now.

941
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Okay.

942
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
I will go and tell them now.

943
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
Okay.

944
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
I will go and tell them now.

945
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Okay.

946
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
I will go and tell them now.

947
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Okay.

948
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
I will go and tell them now.

949
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Okay.

950
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
I will go and tell them now.

951
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Okay.

952
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
I will go and tell them now.

953
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Okay.

954
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
I will go and tell them now.

955
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Okay.

956
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
I will go and tell them now.

957
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Okay.

958
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,640
I will go and tell them now.

959
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Okay.

960
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
I will go and tell them now.

961
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Okay.

962
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
I will go and tell them now.

963
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
I was pieces earlier already.

964
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
So, what the hell was I Little yellis about.

965
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
You BA technology is wasted.

966
00:40:46,640 --> 00:41:10,800
You ME technology, when money is spent to

967
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,200
There are three months left until the show is on.

968
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,480
There's no conflict with today's ad.

969
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,400
Do as I said.

970
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,560
You used to make films for money.

971
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,640
Now you have to put on makeup and watch classic films.

972
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,760
What do you want?

973
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,720
Have you watched it?

974
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,440
Do you know what this film is talking about?

975
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,120
What else do you know except money?

976
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,400
Get out of here!

977
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I'm sorry, Yuelang.

978
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,160
But you have to know

979
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,360
that this film is different.

980
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,400
What's different?

981
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,400
This is my mother's heart.

982
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,240
I know that.

983
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,080
But you change the way you show it.

984
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,600
The audience won't accept it.

985
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,400
Do you know that?

986
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,160
I never make films to please the audience.

987
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,680
I just want to make them happy.

988
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,520
I don't want to make them feel sad.

989
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,920
I don't want to make them feel sad.

990
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,360
I don't want to make them feel sad.

991
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,760
I never make films to please the audience.

992
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,680
I don't know how I will play this film.

993
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
I don't know

994
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,640
if people will like it.

995
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,560
But I believe my mother

996
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,760
will do her best to play it

997
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,360
if she sees her son.

998
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,400
Even if she's the only one in the world

999
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,560
applauding me,

1000
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,760
I think it's worth it.

1001
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,100
He's the only one who's able to prepare

1002
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,240
for me.

1003
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,360
We're both in love.

1004
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,600
That's why I think

1005
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,840
I should compose something special.

1006
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,000
I can dream soon.

1007
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,000
gs

1008
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,960
I talked to Lira,

1009
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,460
That role?

1010
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,160
Don't you like the photo I sent you?

1011
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,760
That role is already set for Jian Xi.

1012
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,360
Jian Xi? How could it be...

1013
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,760
What? Do you have any objections?

1014
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,360
No, no, no.

1015
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,760
It's fine if I don't play Yu Ao Jun.

1016
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,260
Isn't there another important female lead?

1017
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,560
Let me play Feng Miao Yin, okay?

1018
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,060
Sorry, Shen Yan.

1019
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,660
This role is already given to Zuo Zuo.

1020
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,560
Let's work together when we have a chance, okay?

1021
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Subbers Alina, Sophia, Toki

1022
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Timing & subitles brought to you by 中剧独播

1023
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,960
I cry because I had an unexpected fantasy

1024
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,960
The rain is pouring down on the flowers

1025
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,960
The moonlight shines on my friendship

1026
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I sing with my loneliness

1027
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,960
Watching the flowers wither and the sun rises

1028
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,960
Watching loneliness turn into frost

1029
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Watching the tide rise and fall

1030
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,960
The sky is dark and the people are cold

1031
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Too much hope

1032
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,960
In the end, I become desperate

1033
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Watching you come and go

1034
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
Hugging the wind and frost

1035
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,960
Everything is in a trance

1036
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,960
Too stubborn to change the young situation

1037
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,960
There is a lie that never forgets me

1038
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Looking back, all the grudges will have a return

1039
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,960
You and I are gradually lost on the road

1040
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,960
The sea is crazy, don't think about anything

1041
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,960
Where is the sea of ​​heart?

1042
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Just wait for a person to dawn

1043
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,960
Just wait for a person to dawn

1044
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,960
Just wait for a person to dawn

1045
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,960
Dawn
