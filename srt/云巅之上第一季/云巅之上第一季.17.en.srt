1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Miss you

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Love you

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who you are

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,360
In that moment

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,040
The old age

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,120
Turned into a magic eye

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,840
Pass through the loneliness to find you

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Hold the weapon in your hand

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Use all your strength to fight for the most real self

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
No matter what the laugh

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what the rumors

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,000
I will definitely be invincible

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't care if you are willing

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Where is the gold?

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,360
In the past, I kept this sweetness

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,680
No matter where your heart is

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
My heart is here

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,120
Even if the world is invincible

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,880
Only you

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Episode 2

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,400
Go back quickly

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
Why?

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,800
You think I don't know?

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,680
You will have a night play later

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
It doesn't matter

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,560
I am in a good mood now

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,080
No need to accompany me anymore

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,760
Really

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
But

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,160
What but?

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,720
If you don't go back

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm angry

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,600
I want to send you to the door of the house

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,440
Isn't this already downstairs?

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,520
Hurry up, let's go

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Seonghwa

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
I want to go

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,440
Let's go

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Let's go.

49
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,340
The

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,340
This is the information that you need.

51
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,240
Why did you investigate this person?

52
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,540
I'm interested in this girl.

53
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,240
Interested?

54
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,540
I specially asked the four detectives

55
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,140
to go to her school of study and the bar she worked at to inquire.

56
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,240
The bar should have been checked by them,

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,840
with a very tight mouth.

58
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,840
But, people are too cruel.

59
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,480
There are always opportunities to find them.

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,880
In the end, I spent a lot of money to get these photos from a wine cellar.

61
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
It really surprised me.

62
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,240
But what's the use of these photos?

63
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,760
Perhaps these photos can change the situation.

64
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Chi Yan.

65
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Let go of me.

66
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
I don't want to be embarrassed in public.

67
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Come here.

68
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Shen Yan.

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
You go to the dressing room first.

70
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
But...

71
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
Go.

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Ke Lu.

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
You just got off the plane.

74
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
It must be tiring to film an MV.

75
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
I actually wanted to go to you.

76
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,320
But I was afraid that you would misunderstand me and get mad at me.

77
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
So I didn't call you.

78
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Stop acting.

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Ke Lu.

80
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
I'm just a small actress in the company.

81
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Ji Dong is the board member of the company.

82
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
I dare not go out when he asked me out.

83
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
You are the only one in my heart.

84
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
I know everything you did.

85
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Then you...

86
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,820
Are you here to ask me for a reason or to care about me?

87
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
It's my decision to break up with you.

88
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
But I have nothing to do with you.

89
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Why are you coming at me?

90
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Don't drag me into this.

91
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
You are so stupid.

92
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,560
I think you are mistaken about the cause and effect of your relationship.

93
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,560
I didn't go to see Jian Xi because of you.

94
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,560
I wanted to see Jian Xi suffer.

95
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
That's why I'm with you.

96
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I've never liked you.

98
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Ke Lu.

99
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,300
You grew up in a good environment and soon became a singer.

100
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
If I were a kind girl,

101
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
I might like you.

102
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
But I'm not.

103
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
You are a despicable girl.

104
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Who doesn't want to be kind and love everything?

105
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
But has the world ever loved me?

106
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
Has anyone ever loved me?

107
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Has anyone?

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,040
I didn't lie to you from the beginning.

109
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
It's all because of you.

110
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
You hate Jian Xi.

111
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
She's strong in front of you.

112
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
She likes me.

113
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
She's crying in front of you to seek your protection.

114
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
To satisfy your desire for protection.

115
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
It's all because of you.

116
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
But now,

117
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,040
you are a liar.

118
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,780
I've never been a weak girl.

119
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,780
It's all because of you that I've become like this.

120
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,780
Now you are blaming me for my dark heart.

121
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,780
The one who trusted me was you.

122
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,780
Don't say anymore.

123
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
I'll clarify the facts to everyone.

124
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,780
It's too late.

125
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
It's just a quibble.

126
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
And the accident you made on that day.

127
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
It's all your speculation.

128
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
I didn't do anything.

129
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
I advise you not to waste your energy.

130
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
No one can save Jian Xi.

131
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
To be honest,

132
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
I don't hate you.

133
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
I hate myself.

134
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Why should I believe you?

135
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
I hate myself.

136
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
No one can stop me.

137
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
This time it's different.

138
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
The acting association has issued a formal notice.

139
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Unless they cancel the decision,

140
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
she will never act again.

141
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Jian Xi,

142
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
I'll go back to the office.

143
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
I'll go back to get the contract myself.

144
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
No need.

145
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
I can handle my own affairs.

146
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
I'll go with you.

147
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Let's go.

148
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
Do you know how big the impact is

149
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
on us to change the endorsement temporarily?

150
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,260
According to the contract,

151
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
we will compensate according to the price.

152
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,260
This is our responsibility.

153
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,260
The advertisement is about to start.

154
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Since it's withdrawn,

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I will pay it back.

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What's your attitude?

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So arrogant.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you think you are still the first line?

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What's going on between you two?

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What should we do?

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Why?

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The company is about to break down.

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Tell me.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why?

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Why?

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Because of you.

169
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Do you know?

170
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,740
Get out of the entertainment circle.

171
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Say something.

172
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
I don't want to see you.

173
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Get out.

174
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Get out.

175
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Get out.

176
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
Anxin,

177
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
what are you doing?

178
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
I'm not convinced.

179
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
It's our fault.

180
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
We should pay the money.

181
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
We should apologize.

182
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
We didn't give them a penny.

183
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
What else do they want?

184
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,740
Jianxi,

185
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
are you more upset than me

186
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
when you encounter this?

187
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
And that man

188
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,740
was pointing at us.

189
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
What's the quality?

190
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Anxin,

191
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
you are the best agent.

192
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
Why are you crying more than me?

193
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
I saw you

194
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
apologizing to others.

195
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
I feel uncomfortable.

196
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
Why are you laughing?

197
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
It's our fault.

198
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,740
It's reasonable

199
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
to apologize.

200
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
You're weird.

201
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
How?

202
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
If it were the old days,

203
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
you would be more stupid than me.

204
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Okay.

205
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Now our last contract

206
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
is settled.

207
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
What's easy?

208
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
We finally make money.

209
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Now we're in a big trouble.

210
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
No, it's lucky.

211
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Lucky?

212
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
I only have three ads and one contract.

213
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Otherwise, we'll be in debt.

214
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
I really admire you sometimes.

215
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
You can still laugh at this time.

216
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
I can't laugh at all.

217
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
What's wrong with you?

218
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Okay, don't be sad.

219
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
No matter what happens,

220
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
we should stick to it.

221
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
That's the worst.

222
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
We can invest in ourselves.

223
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Nothing to be afraid of.

224
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
You said that.

225
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
What's the point?

226
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Let's go.

227
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Why did you

228
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
think of me today?

229
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Tell me.

230
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
I want to sell my car.

231
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Do you know anyone

232
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
who can sell cars?

233
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
Why do you sell your car?

234
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,740
Jianxi has been banned recently.

235
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,740
Many ads have been canceled.

236
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
I want to see if I can sell my car

237
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,740
and help her.

238
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Not bad.

239
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
You're an agent.

240
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,740
You're so good.

241
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,740
Is it worth it?

242
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,740
It's not easy for a girl

243
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
to help a man.

244
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
How about I tell Tang Fei?

245
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,740
No.

246
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Jianxi doesn't want to let Tang Fei know.

247
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
How about this?

248
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,740
You go to Tongcheng in the morning.

249
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
There are many cars.

250
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,740
The cars are cheap.

251
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,740
You sell the car

252
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
and buy a cheaper one.

253
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,740
You need a tool.

254
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,740
Does it work?

255
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
I've been waiting for a long time.

256
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Let me find it for you.

257
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Look.

258
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
58 Tongcheng.

259
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Look.

260
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
There's a lot of information.

261
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
There are updates every day.

262
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,740
I think it will be solved soon.

263
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
The amount of money is not bad.

264
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,740
Yes.

265
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
Look for it.

266
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,740
I'm sorry.

268
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,740
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,740
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,740
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,740
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,740
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,740
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,740
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,740
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
I'm sorry.

291
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
I'm sorry.

292
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,740
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,740
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,740
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,740
I'm sorry.

300
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,740
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Sorry.

309
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
I am sorry.

317
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
I'm sorry.

318
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
I'm sorry.

319
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,740
I'm sorry.

320
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,740
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,700
Ahmed, this is

323
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,820
my secret to you and your outside gimmick.

324
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,300
You think you can fool me?

325
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,700
First, imagine

326
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,100
that I have my own way.

327
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,260
Why?

328
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,460
I love you.

329
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,540
I admit I can't give you more.

330
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,540
So, my П rise was code to give you data.

331
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,740
This case was signed beef.

332
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,420
It's P goodness I just should have

333
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,960
huge

334
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,660
severance minus one alarm

335
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,940
Don't worry about the company.

336
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,940
I'll take care of it.

337
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,340
Take a break for a while.

338
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,340
You can adjust your mood.

339
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,700
Trust me.

340
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,780
The difficulties will definitely pass.

341
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
The End

342
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,140
What's wrong with you?

343
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
Shut up.

344
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,940
Jinli, you can't do this.

345
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,340
It's decided then.

346
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Come on.

347
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,540
Did you do it on purpose?

348
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,540
You bastard!

349
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,540
I heard from others that

350
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,340
once a person is frightened,

351
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,940
it's not easy to think about unhappy things.

352
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,540
And your mood will be better.

353
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,140
How about it?

354
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,340
Do you feel better now?

355
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,940
Are you feeling better now?

356
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
Actually, I have a lot to say to you.

357
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,940
But I don't know why

358
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,140
every time I see your face,

359
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,940
I...

360
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,540
I can't say much.

361
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,540
I know

362
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,940
you've become very strong now.

363
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,540
You won't show your weak side

364
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,340
in front of many people.

365
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,140
But I also know

366
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,940
how hard you hold on to it.

367
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,740
It's a very hard thing.

368
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,940
But no matter what,

369
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,540
just like what I thought about you before,

370
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,940
you've always been the best female lead in my heart.

371
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,340
Even though you may not be able to see it on TV now,

372
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,940
but

373
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,740
I've recorded all your images and materials.

374
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,940
I'll show you one now.

375
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,340
I hope one day,

376
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,540
when you can't hold on and want to give up,

377
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,540
you can look back at yourself.

378
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
The path of the past,

379
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,140
how hard it was for you to take every step.

380
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,340
Don't give up so easily.

381
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,540
Help!

382
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,340
You...

383
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,340
Dong Xian!

384
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,140
You all deserve to die!

385
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,740
Xiong Xiong!

386
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
Xiong Xiong!

387
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
Have you finished?

388
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
Are you touched?

389
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,740
Actually, I've been asked to record

390
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,340
these materials a long time ago.

391
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,140
I was going to keep them for myself.

392
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
But I couldn't help it.

393
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,340
Now, I'm showing them to you

394
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,740
to make you happy.

395
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,740
You fool.

396
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,140
Qian Xi, do you know

397
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,540
I've been looking for you

398
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,940
for a long time?

399
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,540
I've been looking for you for a long time.

400
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,140
I've been looking for you for a long time.

401
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,540
I've been looking for you for a long time.

402
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,940
I've been looking for you for a long time.

403
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,340
Everything I've done

404
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,740
is to make you happy.

405
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,340
I don't want to see you cry.

406
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,140
I want to see you keep smiling.

407
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,140
I want to see you

408
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,740
happy all the time.

409
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,340
Teacher.

410
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,140
You're here.

411
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
I've been out of work for more than a month.

412
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,740
I want to ask you

413
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,540
what to do next.

414
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,540
If you can't find

415
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,740
the chance to act,

416
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,940
will you give up acting?

417
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,140
I promised you

418
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,340
I wouldn't give up

419
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,740
no matter what happens.

420
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,340
What if you can't find it?

421
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,340
Then I'll wait.

422
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,340
I'll wait until

423
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,740
I can perform on my own stage.

424
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,940
Then I'll take you to a place.

425
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,740
Please come in.

426
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,940
Hello, kids.

427
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,540
Hello, uncle and aunt.

428
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
Call your uncle and aunt

429
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,940
to bring you something delicious.

430
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,540
Teacher, come and send it to us.

431
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:25,940
Okay.

432
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,940
Come on, everyone.

433
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,140
Is this where the teacher said it was?

434
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:31,940
Yes.

435
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,340
How do you perform here?

436
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,340
As long as you really like to perform,

437
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,940
you can do it anywhere.

438
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,540
Try it.

439
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
Don't worry.

440
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,540
Go and perform for the kids.

441
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,340
Just like the time

442
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,140
in the park.

443
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,940
Park?

444
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,540
Go.

445
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,540
Kids, start your performance.

446
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,140
Look carefully.

447
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,940
Since you asked me sincerely,

448
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,140
I'll tell you with mercy.

449
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,140
For the world,

450
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,940
for the world,

451
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,140
for the world,

452
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,140
for the world,

453
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,140
for the world,

454
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,140
we are the Rocket Team in the Milky Way.

455
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,340
Bai Dong,

456
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,340
the white sky is waiting for us.

457
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,940
Yes, that's right.

458
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,740
So nice.

459
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,140
Teacher, it's not like that.

460
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
How come?

461
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,340
I saw it when I was a kid.

462
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,140
Let me show you.

463
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
If someone asks why the sound,

464
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
we'll rush there with the speed of light.

465
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,340
The wind, the earth, the universe

466
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,340
are coming to the world's terror,

467
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,540
spreading to the information of the universe.

468
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,540
The name of the braves, the angels and the devil

469
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
are all known.

470
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,340
No matter who listens to it,

471
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,540
there will be a shaking sound.

472
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,940
Wu Zi, Little Red Wolf,

473
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,740
Meow Meow, Meow Meow,

474
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,140
the great protagonist is us.

475
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,740
We are the invincible Rocket Team.

476
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
You're so cute.

477
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,340
So cute.

478
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
So cute.

479
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
So cute.

480
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,940
So cute.

481
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,740
Auntie Wu,

482
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,140
thank you.

483
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,740
This is for you.

484
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
Thank you, kids.

485
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
You're welcome.

486
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,540
Do you remember what your first goal was?

487
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,740
Because I like it.

488
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,340
Yes,

489
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
I like it.

490
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,740
In fact, the real performance

491
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,940
is not just about the big screen.

492
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,740
It's about following your heart.

493
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,140
Any kind of interest

494
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,340
is supported by the love of the heart.

495
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Some people get money through performance,

496
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
get reputation.

497
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,740
So they gradually forget

498
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,740
what the original purpose of the performance is.

499
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,540
Now is the time.

500
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,540
It's time to remember

501
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,740
and enjoy

502
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,940
the happiness brought to us

503
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,340
just because of the performance.

504
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,540
The happiness brought to us by the performance?

505
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Yes.

506
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,540
You gave the kids candy.

507
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,340
They gave you apples.

508
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,940
The same goes for the performance.

509
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,940
You bring happiness to everyone.

510
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,940
What do they give you back?

511
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,940
The satisfaction of being recognized.

512
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,340
The happiness of achieving value.

513
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
Yes.

514
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
Teacher,

515
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,740
I thought you only told me

516
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,940
about winning the prize.

517
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,340
I didn't expect you to say that.

518
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,540
I just want to remind you

519
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,340
not to forget your original purpose

520
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,140
all the time.

521
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,540
Otherwise,

522
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,540
you will never win the prize.

523
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,140
I don't understand.

524
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,940
You should always remember

525
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,140
that the feeling of being depressed is enough.

526
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,140
Tang Fei, here.

527
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,340
The invitation?

528
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
Yes.

529
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,140
A year-long charity party.

530
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,540
You are a special guest.

531
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,740
The acting association?

532
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,140
Tang Fei,

533
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
let's invite Ji Qing for today's dance party.

534
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
How about it?

535
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,940
He will attend it anyway.

536
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,940
These days,

537
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,940
Xiao has been asking me about it.

538
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,140
He will call you today.

539
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,140
Why?

540
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,540
He wants you to attend the charity party tomorrow night.

541
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,540
Are you sure

542
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,140
he will invite me to be his dance partner?

543
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,140
Of course.

544
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,740
Who else can be Tang Fei's dance partner?

545
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,340
This dress is so beautiful.

546
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,340
You are so good-looking.

547
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,940
This dress is so beautiful.

548
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,940
I'm sorry, Miss Ji.

549
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,340
This is the limited edition this year.

550
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,540
There is only one in the store.

551
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,740
It has been booked.

552
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,940
It has been booked?

553
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,540
We are the VIPs here.

554
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,940
All the new designs should be chosen by Ji Qing first.

555
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
If you keep doing this,

556
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,340
we won't come here anymore.

557
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,340
I'm really sorry.

558
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,740
What's the use of saying sorry?

559
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,740
All right, all right, all right.

560
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,540
Forget it.

561
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,540
We have better ones.

562
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,540
Ji Qing,

563
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,140
you finally found a dress.

564
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,740
How can you just let it go so easily?

565
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,740
It's okay.

566
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,740
There must be better ones.

567
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,740
Let's go.

568
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,940
Let's go.

569
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,940
Hello.

570
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,140
Hello, Anxin.

571
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
I beg you.

572
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,340
Can you do me a favor?

573
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,940
Jianxi.

574
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:06,940
Coming.

575
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,940
Jianxi.

576
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
What are you waiting for?

577
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
Speed up.

578
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,740
What are you doing?

579
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,740
What are you doing?

580
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
What are you doing?

581
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,140
What are you doing?

582
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,340
This is the star dress I prepared for you.

583
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,740
Style group.

584
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
What group?

585
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,540
Style group.

586
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,940
What are you doing?

587
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,940
Speed up.

588
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,340
I don't want the European and American style.

589
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,340
I'm obviously a cute style.

590
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,740
Perfect.

591
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
You haven't said it yet.

592
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
What are we going to do?

593
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
It's too late.

594
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,540
We'll talk on the way.

595
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,340
Anxin.

596
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,540
What are you doing?

597
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,940
You'll know when you leave with me.

598
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,540
You don't say it, I won't go.

599
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,540
Go.

600
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,540
Anxin.

601
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
Come on, get in the car.

602
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,140
Anxin.

603
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,140
Anxin.

604
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,140
Anxin.

605
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,140
Anxin.

606
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,140
Anxin.

607
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,140
Anxin.

608
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,140
Anxin.

609
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,140
Anxin.

610
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,340
Anxin.

611
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,340
Anxin.

612
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,640
Anxin.

613
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,940
Let's go.

614
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,740
Take care of her.

615
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
No problem, let's go.

616
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
You haven't told me where we're going.

617
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,340
You will know when we arrive.

618
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,140
Can't you tell me in advance?

619
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,540
I can't.

620
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,540
But...

621
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,340
No but.

622
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,540
You won't be sold.

623
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,500
Don't worry, don't worry if you hurt yourself.

624
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,420
Don't worry so much about me and your mother.

625
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,860
I'll offer whatever you ask.

626
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,140
If you have to do what I told you,

627
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,100
it's not silly to run into this.

628
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,940
Thankfully, everything is completely fine.

629
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,140
Honey!

630
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,340
Hello, are you comfortable here?

631
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,140
Why is my head spinning?

632
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,140
But...

633
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,940
Stop but.

634
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,340
Tang Fei will go to the meeting city directly.

635
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,740
Do you want to go in alone?

636
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,340
Let's go.

637
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
What are you doing?

638
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,940
D triggered.

639
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,140
Please give me a chance to explain.

640
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,340
to explain.

641
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:13,940
Hel bent.

642
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,900
Nothing to explain.

643
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,500
This time, we are handling Jianxi because of the bad social influence.

644
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,900
Think about it. There are too many scandals that she caused.

645
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,500
We cannot cover up for her anymore.

646
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,300
But I am just a good friend of hers.

647
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,500
You are with her. It is of no benefit to you.

648
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Stop talking for her. It is useless.

649
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,900
Mayor Li.

650
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,500
Do you want me to punish you?

651
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,100
Liu Dong, hello.

652
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
You see?

653
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,900
No one is willing to believe your explanation.

654
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
Stop wasting your energy.

655
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:58,900
The reason why people believe me is because I am the victim.

656
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Even standing in front of you now,

657
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,900
they will automatically think that I am a heartbreaker to you.

658
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,900
I think you are the most acting actress.

659
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,900
You are overpraising me.

660
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
The last scene on the left is really good.

661
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
Thank you.

662
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,900
That scene is still so beautiful.

663
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
Thank you.

664
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
Okay.

665
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,900
What is wrong? Are you tired?

666
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
I am fine.

667
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Still fine? You are so tired.

668
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,900
You have been busy filming recently.

669
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
You have to take care of Xiao Nian.

670
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Thank you.

671
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
It is good that Xiao Nian is not having a fever.

672
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,900
I want to take time to take her to do a detailed check-up.

673
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,900
Okay.

674
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
How about tomorrow?

675
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
I will take her there tomorrow. I will go with you.

676
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
Okay.

677
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
I will go with you.

678
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
Okay.

679
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Tang Fei will attend the charity evening every year.

680
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
So you don't have to worry.

681
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
President Xi,

682
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
stop following me, okay?

683
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
I have my own freedom.

684
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
I am just concerned about you.

685
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,900
In your eyes,

686
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
I am just like the vase in the mall.

687
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,900
You must be careful of the vase.

688
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
But I am sorry.

689
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
I don't want to be the vase anymore.

690
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
I don't want to be labeled.

691
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,900
Okay.

692
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,900
If you really want to be labeled,

693
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,900
then the price will be empty.

694
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Because in my heart,

695
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
you are always the Wu family.

696
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Don't forget.

697
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
Even if it is a priceless product,

698
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,900
it still has to be sold.

699
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
What's the difference?

700
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Okay, stop being emotional.

701
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
I heard that you are not happy with Shen Yan in the studio.

702
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
How about this?

703
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Let's go there together

704
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
and say hello to her.

705
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
To you.

706
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
Thank you.

707
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
I don't like to work with actresses

708
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,900
who are not in the same field as Feng Yin.

709
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
In this field,

710
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
it is also a kind of strength to interact with people.

711
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
Although Shen Yan's acting is not as good as yours,

712
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
she has her own advantages.

713
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,900
Shen Yan has just been in the company for a month.

714
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
She has remembered everyone's birthday.

715
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
She is warm and considerate.

716
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
With this,

717
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
you can't do it.

718
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
You can't do it either.

719
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
You can get today's results

720
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
not only by your own efforts.

721
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
More importantly,

722
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,900
I am helping you.

723
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,900
So you mean I am relying on my family?

724
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Of course not.

725
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
I just want to tell you

726
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,900
not to do stupid things like Jian Xi

727
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,900
and ruin your future.

728
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,900
You...

729
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Don't be angry.

730
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Goddesses can't be angry.

731
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
Come here.

732
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
I will introduce you to Mr. Wang.

733
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,900
Let's go.

734
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Hello, Mr. Wang.

735
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Hello.

736
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
Let me introduce.

737
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,900
This is our company's big card,

738
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
Ji Qing.

739
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Dear guests,

740
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,900
dear friends,

741
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Miss Ji,

742
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
you are so beautiful.

743
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,900
Today,

744
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,900
we are going to hold

745
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,900
the 29th

746
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,900
Charity Night of the Performing Arts Association.

747
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Dear guests,

748
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
please take out your precious time

749
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
and come to our party.

750
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,900
Here,

751
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
please allow us

752
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
to express our gratitude

753
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
on behalf of the Performing Arts Association

754
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,900
for your coming.

755
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,900
Tang Fei.

756
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
Tang Fei is Jian Xi.

757
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,900
Come here.

758
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,900
Tang Fei is here.

759
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Look at them.

760
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,900
It's really Tang Fei.

761
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
How could this happen?

762
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
How could this happen?

763
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
Why is Tang Fei here?

764
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
What's going on?

765
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Tang Fei, this is the charity night.

766
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,900
I need to go back.

767
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
Don't go.

768
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,900
I will lose my dance partner if you go.

769
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
I can't stay here.

770
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,900
Don't go anywhere.

771
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Stay with me.

772
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,900
I will go over there.

773
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,900
What do you mean?

774
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Why did you bring her here?

775
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,900
I brought her here

776
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
to say hello to you.

777
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,900
Today is the charity night

778
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
held by the Performing Arts Association.

779
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
There are so many special media

780
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
here.

781
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,900
Do you want everyone

782
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,900
to see your smile?

783
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
Don't be afraid.

784
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
You shouldn't be afraid.

785
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
You should be the one

786
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
who is behind all this.

787
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
Mayor Li.

788
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Tang Fei.

789
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,900
Hello.

790
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Let me introduce you.

791
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,900
This Miss Jian Xi

792
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,900
is not only

793
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,900
my girlfriend

794
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,900
but also my long-time girlfriend.

795
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,900
What?

796
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
You didn't hear it?

797
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
Really?

798
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,900
I've never dated anyone before.

799
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Tang Fei.

800
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,900
You can't joke like this.

801
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,900
Do you think I'm joking?

802
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
Everyone knows it.

803
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Everyone.

804
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
Dear reporters.

805
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
Today,

806
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
I want to announce

807
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
something.

808
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,900
This is my girlfriend,

809
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
Miss Jian Xi.

810
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,900
What's going on?

811
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Yes, Mr. Tang.

812
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,900
What's going on?

813
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
Why did Jian Xi

814
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,900
become your girlfriend?

815
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,900
You never announced

816
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,900
your girlfriend in public.

817
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
Please explain it to us.

818
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
I'm sorry, everyone.

819
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Actually, I've been dating

820
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Jian Xi for a long time.

821
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,900
Maybe it's because

822
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,900
of my personality.

823
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,900
So I don't want my privacy

824
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,900
to be exposed to the media too soon.

825
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
But recently,

826
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
there's a rumor that

827
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,900
my girlfriend

828
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
is the third person

829
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,900
in someone else's relationship.

830
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,900
It makes me very angry.

831
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
So I think I have a duty

832
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
to come out and

833
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
clarify it for her.

834
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
Is it true that

835
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,900
the rumors before were all false?

836
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,900
Isn't Jian Xi the secret lover of Ke Lu?

837
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,900
What's going on?

838
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
We've all been fooled.

839
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,900
Jian Xi is not the third person.

840
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,900
Then how did the scandal come about?

841
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Now there are many artists

842
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
who are trying to

843
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
take responsibility for their actions.

844
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
They even split up

845
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,900
to fight.

846
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
I think I have no right

847
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,900
to interfere with others' actions.

848
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
But I just want to say that

849
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,900
the more they do this,

850
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
the more my relationship

851
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,900
with Jian Xi will be more solid.

852
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Wow, I'm so happy.

853
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
Tang Fei hasn't

854
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
revealed his relationship yet.

855
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900
Jian Xi is really not simple.

856
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,900
She's not born

857
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
and she's relying on Tang Fei.

858
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,900
Look, she's relying on Tang Fei.

859
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,900
She doesn't have to worry about it anymore.

860
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,900
What kind of drama is this?

861
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
The rumors before were all false.

862
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,900
Isn't she committing suicide?

863
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
She's living a very good life.

864
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,900
You didn't see it with your own eyes.

865
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
Tang Fei and Ke Lu,

866
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,900
if it were you,

867
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,900
who would you choose?

868
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
You don't know?

869
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,900
You have such a good boyfriend.

870
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
Why would you be the third person?

871
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
You could have died.

872
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,900
You accidentally got into a fight.

873
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
That's why you're so stupid.

874
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,900
So,

875
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
suicide is fake?

876
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,900
It's very possible.

877
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,900
I heard that she and Jian Xi

878
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
are competing for a role.

879
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
It's just a matter of time

880
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
for the audience to see.

881
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
No need to go.

882
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Even if you explain it

883
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,900
to the media and the board,

884
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,900
you can't beat Tang Fei.

885
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Why?

886
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Because you're the victim.

887
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,900
You don't have to be happy about what you say.

888
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
And Tang Fei's position in this circle

889
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,900
is irreconcilable.

890
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
The media and the board

891
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,900
will give him a good face.

892
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,900
Tomorrow,

893
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,900
the news will spread.

894
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
So,

895
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,900
you don't need to explain it anymore.

896
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,900
Director Li,

897
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,900
I've been wanting to find a chance

898
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
to clarify this misunderstanding.

899
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
I don't want to let Jian Xi

900
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
be famous

901
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,900
because of some false rumors.

902
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,900
I hope you can consider it.

903
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
Well...

904
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,900
Since the main character of the rumors

905
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,900
is not Jian Xi,

906
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,900
I hope you can

907
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,900
clarify it for Jian Xi.

908
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,900
What do you think?

909
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,900
Tang Fei,

910
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,900
today is the online meeting of the assassins.

911
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
You're too much for a military leader.

912
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
I can't be that much.

913
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,900
I know you're wrong.

914
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,900
An actor like Jian Xi

915
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
is famous in the entertainment industry.

916
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,900
That's the loss of the entire entertainment circle.

917
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
I'm contributing to the entertainment association.

918
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Director Li,

919
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
so many reporters and friends are here today.

920
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
You should express your gratitude.

921
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
After the dinner,

922
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,900
the board will come back

923
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,900
to write the report.

924
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,900
Okay?

925
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,900
You're so kind.

926
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
Thank you, Director Li.

927
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,900
Okay.

928
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,900
Director Li.

929
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,900
Okay.

930
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,900
I'm glad to hear that.

931
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
Let's take a picture together.

932
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,900
Yes.

933
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,900
Come on.

934
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Let's take a picture together.

935
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Congratulations.

936
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,900
Come on.

937
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,900
Smile.

938
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Smile.

939
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Come on.

940
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Okay.

941
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Smile again.

942
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Come on.

943
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,900
Thank you.

944
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,900
Thank you.

945
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,900
Okay.

946
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,900
Turn here.

947
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,900
Very good.

948
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,900
Smile.

949
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,900
Okay. Thank you.

950
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,900
I wish you two a good acting.

951
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
I hope you two can help each other

952
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
in your work.

953
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,900
Congratulations.

954
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,900
Miss Jian Xi.

955
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,900
You're so talented.

956
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
Jian Xi is so talented.

957
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
She got Tang Fei

958
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,900
without any effort.

959
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
You don't want to hear it?

960
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Then you can watch it.

961
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,900
At this time tomorrow,

962
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,900
her scandal will be cleared.

963
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,900
At that time,

964
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,900
the Academy of Drama

965
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,900
will discuss about

966
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,900
punishing her again.

967
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,900
Tang Fei has money and status

968
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,900
in this circle.

969
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,900
She has made a step up.

970
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
What are you going to do?

971
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
I envy Jian Xi.

972
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,900
I thought she was completely ruined this time.

973
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
I didn't expect Tang Fei

974
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
to take such a big risk

975
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
for her.

976
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,900
If she can't do it well,

977
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,900
her reputation

978
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
will be ruined.

979
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
It can be seen that

980
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Tang Fei

981
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,900
must love her very much.

982
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Such a woman

983
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,900
is the real fox Jin Mang.

984
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
Enough.

985
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Are you angry?

986
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Ji Qing.

987
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,900
You have everything

988
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
since you were born.

989
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
You should have never thought

990
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,900
that the man you like

991
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
would be taken away

992
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
by a girl

993
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,900
who is not worth a penny.

994
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,900
That's right.

995
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,900
Jian Xi

996
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
did get Tang Fei's heart.

997
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,900
But she is different from you.

998
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,900
If you hate someone for me,

999
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
I will hate you

1000
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
for being a woman who is not worth a penny.

1001
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,900
I understand.

1002
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
Jian Xi

1003
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
becomes Tang Fei's girlfriend.

1004
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,900
You are very sad

1005
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
and jealous.

1006
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
But you have to show

1007
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,900
a very generous look.

1008
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,900
You are still pretending

1009
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,900
in front of me.

1010
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
You are really

1011
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,900
too tired.

1012
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,900
A woman like you

1013
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,900
who has been

1014
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,900
taught by the same school

1015
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,900
for a long time

1016
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,900
is too boring.

1017
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,900
No wonder Tang Fei

1018
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
doesn't like you.

1019
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
What do you want to say?

1020
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,900
You want to

1021
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,900
defeat Jian Xi, right?

1022
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,900
But now it seems that

1023
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,900
no matter it is love or hate,

1024
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,900
or career,

1025
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,900
you have already lost to your teacher.

1026
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,900
I am just surprised.

1027
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,900
You are clearly more beautiful than her.

1028
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,900
And your starting point is higher than her.

1029
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,900
How can you lose so badly?

1030
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,900
No.

1031
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,900
I can win.

1032
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,900
I will definitely win her

1033
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,900
with great glory.

1034
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,900
Good evening,

1035
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,900
guests of the stage.

1036
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,900
Tonight,

1037
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,900
Gongyule donated 200,000 yuan

1038
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,900
to buy a piano

1039
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
by Miss Shen Yan.

1040
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,900
200,000 yuan.

1041
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,900
200,000 yuan.

1042
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,900
I hope to do my best

1043
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,900
for the charity business.

1044
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,900
So next,

1045
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900
we will give the time

1046
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,900
to Shen Yan.

1047
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,900
I am sorry.

1048
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,900
I am sorry.

1049
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,900
I am sorry.

1050
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,900
I am sorry.

1051
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,900
I am sorry.

1052
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,900
I am sorry.

1053
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,900
I am sorry.

1054
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,900
I am sorry.

1055
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,900
I am sorry.

1056
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,900
I am sorry.

1057
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,900
I am sorry.

1058
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,900
I am sorry.

1059
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,900
I am sorry.

1060
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,900
I am sorry.

1061
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,900
I am sorry.

1062
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,900
I am sorry.

1063
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,900
I am sorry.

1064
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,900
I am sorry.

1065
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,900
I am sorry.

1066
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,900
I am sorry.

1067
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,900
I am sorry.

1068
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,900
I am sorry.

1069
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,900
I am sorry.

1070
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,900
I am sorry.

1071
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
I am sorry.

1072
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,900
I am sorry.

1073
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,900
I am sorry.

1074
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,900
I am sorry.

1075
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,900
I am sorry.

1076
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,900
I am sorry.

1077
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,900
I am sorry.

1078
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,900
I am sorry.

1079
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,900
I am sorry.

1080
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,900
I am sorry.

1081
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,900
I am sorry.

1082
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,900
I am sorry.

1083
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,900
I am sorry.

1084
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,900
I am sorry.

1085
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,900
I am sorry.

1086
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,900
I am sorry.

1087
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,900
I am sorry.

1088
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,900
I am sorry.

1089
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,900
I am sorry.

1090
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,900
I am sorry.

1091
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,900
I am sorry.

1092
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,900
I am sorry.

1093
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,900
I am sorry.

1094
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,900
I am sorry.

1095
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,900
I am sorry.

1096
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,900
I am sorry.

1097
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,900
I am sorry.

1098
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,900
I am sorry.

1099
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,900
I am sorry.

1100
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,900
I am sorry.

1101
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,900
I am sorry.

1102
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,900
I am sorry.

1103
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,900
I am sorry.

1104
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,900
I am sorry.

1105
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:15,900
The typhoon is not going to stop.

1106
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,900
Where will the new red sea be?

1107
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,900
Just like this, waiting for someone to arrive at dawn.

1108
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,900
Just like this, waiting for someone to arrive at dawn.

1109
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:40,900
Just like this, waiting for someone to arrive at dawn.
