1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,480
Go down your own path

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't want

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,280
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,800
I don't care who is weak or weak

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, the standard age

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,240
Transformed into magical eyes

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,880
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
Put on the most solid gold armor

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
Hold the weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,800
Use all your strength to fight for the most real you

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the little tricks

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what rumors

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,920
I will definitely do it

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,080
World is invincible

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,400
I don't care if you are willing

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
Where is the gold?

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,400
In the past, I kept the sweet

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,720
No matter where your heart is

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,040
My heart is here

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,160
Even if the world is invincible

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,960
I only have you

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,160
Transversion byמOS

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,600
English stay till the end

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,480
Looks like Xiao Jiaidu needs to practice more

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,880
The attack training is indeed different from the story.

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,080
This is something that can't be helped.

33
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,080
We should admit defeat earlier.

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,880
The director hasn't spoken yet. Why are you in such a hurry?

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,880
Okay.

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,680
Okay.

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,080
Jinxing, let me see. Does it hurt?

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,680
I'm fine.

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,080
Are you okay, Jinxing? I didn't mean to.

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Are you okay?

41
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,880
You really worked hard for Lu Zhou's request.

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,280
Tang Fei, I didn't mean to. Don't blame her.

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,080
Tang Fei, it's not a big deal. Don't take it to heart.

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,480
You're so careless. What if you leave Dad behind?

45
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,280
I'll go with you to clean up the wound.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,680
Come.

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,080
There's a medical room over there.

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,280
Let's go and take a look.

49
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,880
Thank you.

50
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,080
Let's go.

51
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,480
Slowly.

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,280
Jinxing.

53
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,680
Jinxing, what's wrong?

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
I'm fine.

55
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,080
How can you not get up? What's wrong?

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
I accidentally sprained my ankle.

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
I'll be fine after a little rest.

58
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,780
wait a minute

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
athlete

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,980
Please just a moment.

61
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
There's no need to jump.

62
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,880
Please try to climb up the tree.

63
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,880
You've got to press harder.

64
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
And then go back to the Madeleine.

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,780
년

66
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,080
So, you must do it when you perform.

67
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Are you okay, Jian Xin?

68
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Jian Xin, can you still hold on?

69
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Yes.

70
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Good.

71
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Lu Zhou, have you treated Jian Xin as a human?

72
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
She has fallen many times.

73
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
So what?

74
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
There is only one chance.

75
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
If you can't hold on to this chance,

76
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
you will waste all the efforts you have made.

77
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
You are so heartless.

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Shut up.

79
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
An Xin.

80
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Jian Xin, don't listen to her.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Hurry up and practice.

82
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Okay, you can slide.

83
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
I don't care about you anymore.

84
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
An Xin.

85
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Practice.

86
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Good.

87
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
Think about it.

88
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
The queen of the ice will be yours soon.

89
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Hurry up.

90
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Adjust the rhythm.

91
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Speed up.

92
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Speed up.

93
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Speed up.

94
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Turn around.

95
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Teacher, my waist...

96
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Jian Xin.

97
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Jian Xin.

98
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Jian Xin.

99
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Teacher.

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
How are you?

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
I can't move.

102
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
I can't move.

103
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Hurry up.

104
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Help.

105
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Jian Xin, hold on.

106
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Help.

107
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Help.

108
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
How is it, doctor?

109
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Come.

110
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Doctor,

111
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
what happened to me just now?

112
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Miss Jian,

113
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
you have a spinal cord fracture.

114
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Then,

115
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
why didn't I have any abnormalities before?

116
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
We have seen a lot of cases

117
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
of spinal damage caused by dancing.

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Usually, the development of adults' diseases is very slow

119
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
and will not affect daily life.

120
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
But it is obvious that

121
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Miss Jian, you practiced too hard.

122
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Your spinal cord is seriously damaged.

123
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
It doesn't look like anything now.

124
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
But it will be different if you continue.

125
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
What is different?

126
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
The body deformation is just slight.

127
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,080
It is very likely that it will affect the heart and lung functions.

128
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
It is so serious?

129
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
What is more serious

130
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
is that it may cause a paralyzed body.

131
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Can you bring a sedative?

132
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
The sedative can only play a role in delaying the development.

133
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,080
I suggest that you take the treatment as soon as possible

134
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
and rest well.

135
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,080
In short, you can't practice like this without rest.

136
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
No.

137
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
I have to act.

138
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
This is too risky.

139
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
It's just the beginning.

140
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Pain will be intensified in the future.

141
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Don't always hold hands.

142
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Ji Qin.

143
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
Are you okay?

144
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
What are you doing?

145
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

146
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
It's just a netball.

147
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
Why are you so desperate?

148
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
That was an accident.

149
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Accident?

150
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,080
I think you are deliberately taking advantage of our family's love.

151
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
You are so sinister.

152
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
I didn't think so.

153
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Do you know it clearly?

154
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
It's all for the King of Ice.

155
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I will give up on the King of Ice.

156
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Why?

157
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
I just won't play this role again.

158
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,080
So you can rest assured.

159
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
I don't need you to give up.

160
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm not giving up.

161
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,080
I just suddenly have no interest in this role.

162
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Looking at his appearance that day,

163
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
he should want to prove himself to be this role.

164
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Why would he change his mind suddenly?

165
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Leave him alone.

166
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Anyway, it's good.

167
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
The heroine is yours.

168
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
What I want

169
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
doesn't need anyone to give it to me.

170
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
It's a kind of humiliation.

171
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Cut.

172
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
Okay.

173
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
It's done.

174
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Thank you all.

175
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
It's done. Let's clean up.

176
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Let's clean up the props.

177
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Clean up the costumes.

178
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Let's go to the back.

179
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
What's wrong?

180
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Are you okay?

181
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
It's done.

182
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Let's go.

183
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Oh my god.

184
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
How could this happen?

185
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Tang Fei.

186
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Come up and sit.

187
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Here.

188
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Thank you.

189
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Why did you suddenly come here?

190
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
I was afraid that I would pass by here.

191
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
I came to see you.

192
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Can you take me with you?

193
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
Sure.

194
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Of course.

195
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Let's go.

196
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Let's go.

197
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Let's go.

198
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Let's go.

199
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Let's go.

200
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Let's go.

201
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
Let's go.

202
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Let's go.

203
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Let's go.

204
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Of course.

205
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Let's go.

206
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Let's go.

207
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Jian Xi

208
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
has quit the competition of the Ice Queen.

209
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Really?

210
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Yes.

211
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Why did he suddenly quit

212
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
when he wanted to take on this role?

213
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,080
There must be some reason.

214
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Do you know why?

215
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
No.

216
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
How could it be?

217
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Such an important thing.

218
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Maybe

219
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
he hasn't had time to tell you.

220
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
It's possible.

221
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
I'll go now.

222
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Bye.

223
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
It seems...

224
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I don't know myself anymore.

225
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Do you know how?

226
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Of course.

227
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Then...

228
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
What else could it be?

229
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
What can it be between me and you?

230
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
The classic novel I read

231
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
would be yet another book that can be written and read.

232
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Why did you leave before she did?

233
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
She always believed in your efforts

234
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
to finally write this book into her head.

235
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
If it wasn't for her audience

236
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
and me following her still

237
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
she wouldn't have the Воє KNÙ X advert.

238
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
That's right.

239
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
I will.

240
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,580
Of course I will.

241
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,580
I just want to try the taste of jealousy.

242
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,140
Every day,

243
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,540
I'm wandering between education and desire.

244
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,540
I tell myself in a simple way,

245
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,060
it's okay to lose it.

246
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,300
I can bear it.

247
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,900
But when I look at myself in the mirror,

248
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,860
I feel more and more strange.

249
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,740
Ji Qing.

250
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,220
Tang Fei, the best female lead.

251
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,460
I want it. I really want it.

252
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,980
Qin Wen Sen, tell me what to do.

253
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,940
What should I do?

254
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,660
Turn around.

255
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,820
Why?

256
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,620
Back to the company.

257
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,140
There will be an announcement in an hour.

258
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,100
Cancel it.

259
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,860
Turn around.

260
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,860
Yes.

261
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,980
Where are you going, Tang Fei?

262
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,660
Tang Fei.

263
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,940
Mr. Tang, it's late. Why are you here?

264
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,780
This kid is just not obedient.

265
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,100
Miss Qin,

266
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,900
the kids are waiting for you.

267
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,980
Go.

268
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,220
Are you okay?

269
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,780
I feel like all my bones are fighting against myself.

270
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,820
Teacher, I can't play the King of Ice.

271
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,940
I can't even play the normal role.

272
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,700
Jianxi, don't force yourself anymore, okay?

273
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,940
Take a break for a while.

274
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,940
When you're recovered, we'll come again.

275
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,020
Teacher, if I give up,

276
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,740
can I still have a chance to act in the future?

277
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,380
Tell me, do you really like acting?

278
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,380
I like it.

279
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,580
Okay, then stick to it.

280
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,460
You must keep acting.

281
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,860
But my body...

282
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,740
If your body can't play the King of Ice,

283
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,940
then play something else.

284
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,420
Play something that your body can bear.

285
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,460
If your body can't bear it,

286
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,620
then play a tree.

287
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,820
You must also play a rock.

288
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,380
Do you know?

289
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,620
Your happiness and sorrow

290
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,060
are all in front of the camera.

291
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,540
It's just that the talent God gave you,

292
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,460
no one has it.

293
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,620
Acting is your soul to you.

294
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,540
If a person has no soul,

295
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,620
what's the point of living?

296
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,180
Jianxi, if you want to act,

297
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,140
I'll be with you.

298
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,900
Even if the doctor says you can't,

299
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,780
I'll be with you until the last moment.

300
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,820
Teacher.

301
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,700
Jianxi, no matter what happens,

302
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,100
I'll be by your side.

303
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,460
Teacher!

304
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,380
Get up.

305
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,620
Which is more وا Pincer Magic Bat stood out,

306
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,460
Afraid�

307
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,060
And even said the engagement speech

308
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,860
Was to indicate how the participants

309
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:58,740
southernized the

310
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:05,040
We do not princes

311
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,640
Anxin.

312
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,360
Come.

313
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,680
Come.

314
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,000
Sit.

315
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,280
Sit.

316
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,680
That day...

317
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,640
This is for you.

318
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,760
What is this?

319
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
A resignation letter.

320
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,720
Anxin.

321
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,320
What's wrong?

322
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
Are you feeling unwell?

323
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,480
What is this?

324
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,840
Nothing.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,680
Let me see.

326
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,560
It's nothing.

327
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,960
This...

328
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,960
I'm doing the advertisement for them.

329
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,560
Anxin.

330
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,640
This looks like a medical device.

331
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,640
When did you do the advertisement

332
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,120
for medical products?

333
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,120
Tell me the truth.

334
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,200
What's wrong with you?

335
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm just squeezing my side veins.

336
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,640
It's nothing.

337
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,520
Squeezing your side veins?

338
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,440
Only kids can get sick.

339
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,800
Even adults can.

340
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,960
Are you crazy?

341
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,280
If you're not feeling well,

342
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,800
you should go to the hospital.

343
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,400
Stop acting.

344
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,960
If you keep acting like this,

345
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,240
your health will only get worse.

346
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,120
I have a break.

347
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
I pushed the King of Ice away.

348
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,760
Aren't you going to

349
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,840
the World of the Rose?

350
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,920
Jianxi.

351
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,400
Is acting

352
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,960
really that important to you?

353
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,320
Anxin.

354
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,640
I really want to act.

355
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,800
Although I can't

356
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,600
act like the King of Ice,

357
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,920
I can make some cultural films.

358
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't need to be very energetic.

359
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
I can do it.

360
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,760
All right.

361
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,520
Don't worry about me anymore.

362
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
I promise you.

363
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,280
After this film,

364
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,720
I'll have a good rest.

365
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,960
I'll get well soon.

366
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,880
Okay?

367
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,000
But you have to promise me.

368
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,040
Don't leave me.

369
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,040
You can't

370
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,200
promise me either.

371
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
If you feel uncomfortable,

372
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,760
just tell me the truth.

373
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,600
Okay?

374
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,760
Okay.

375
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
I promise you.

376
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,720
I'll tell you everything.

377
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,680
All right.

378
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,680
Don't cry.

379
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,160
It's really okay.

380
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,920
Listen to me.

381
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,240
After the test,

382
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,120
I'll take you to the hospital

383
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,280
for a check-up.

384
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,520
This dress is so pretty.

385
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,240
But Yu Zhi Ping is a strange person.

386
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,840
I don't know what kind of person he likes.

387
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,600
Really?

388
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
He's really a strange person.

389
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Why are you so angry?

390
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I'm so nervous.

391
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,800
Let's go and sit down.

392
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
The new dress is so expensive.

393
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,360
Don't get it wrinkled.

394
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,000
Why are you here?

395
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,480
Our Ji Qing was also invited

396
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,680
to the audition.

397
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,800
Isn't your Ji Qing

398
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,600
going to play the queen of the ice?

399
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why are you here?

400
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,120
If there is no opponent,

401
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,920
it doesn't make any sense

402
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,240
to get the queen of ice.

403
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,640
What do you mean?

404
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,320
The rose girl will be mine.

405
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,600
You don't lack the show.

406
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,800
Why do you need it?

407
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,600
Ah Xi.

408
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,520
What?

409
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,720
Are you afraid?

410
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,440
Or you have no reason

411
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,840
to push the queen of ice

412
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,800
to avoid

413
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,920
competing with me?

414
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,160
No.

415
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,000
Jian Xi.

416
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,320
Don't be afraid.

417
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,200
Let's use the audition

418
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
to compete.

419
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,920
Competition?

420
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,520
This time,

421
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,280
I will win.

422
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,960
Wei.

423
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,240
Are you here for the audition?

424
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes.

425
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,200
By the way,

426
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,680
why hasn't Yu Zhi Pian come yet?

427
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,680
He asked us to meet at 3 o'clock.

428
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,480
It's been half an hour.

429
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,680
Mr. Yu will give you

430
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,800
one hour.

431
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,040
We will meet officially

432
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,920
in an hour.

433
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,160
One hour?

434
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,600
But we are here

435
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,560
to audition officially.

436
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,120
In an hour, we may...

437
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,960
Sorry.

438
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,440
If you don't want to wait,

439
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,480
you can give up.

440
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,760
There are many people

441
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,920
competing for this role.

442
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,440
No.

443
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,160
We will wait.

444
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,480
Hello.

445
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,600
I want to ask you.

446
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,400
You said one hour.

447
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,440
Is there any special meaning

448
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,800
in one hour?

449
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,200
Is there a script or...

450
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,960
Here is the thing.

451
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,160
Mr. Yu said

452
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,480
each actress who came to audition

453
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
should be prepared.

454
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,680
In one hour,

455
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,800
the one who left the most impression

456
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,880
will be the heroine of the rose life.

457
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,080
Come on.

458
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,240
Come on.

459
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,720
Guys.

460
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,400
The makeup machine is ready.

461
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,800
We have a makeup artist.

462
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,760
Of course,

463
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,160
you can get ready.

464
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,960
Remember,

465
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
go back to the audition hall in an hour.

466
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,520
Mr. Yu will wait for you there.

467
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,680
Good luck.

468
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,800
Thank you.

469
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,320
We will be there soon.

470
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,960
Then we will go to the makeup room.

471
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,600
Go.

472
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,880
Go.

473
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,800
Give up now.

474
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,840
What are you talking about?

475
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,080
The best makeup artist in China

476
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,080
is definitely you.

477
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,840
I really hate

478
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,360
talking to this woman.

479
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,960
You must turn our Ji Qing

480
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,480
into the most beautiful woman in the whole factory.

481
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,560
Kill the whole factory.

482
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,120
Okay.

483
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,800
What kind of makeup should I do?

484
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,600
The heroine of rose life

485
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,800
is a beauty of the Republic.

486
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,520
Let's do the cheongsam.

487
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,360
Okay.

488
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,800
Cheongsam is cheongsam.

489
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,880
Let's start now.

490
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,880
Okay.

491
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,160
Ms. Huazhong.

492
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,160
Are you confident

493
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,600
in winning the other person's stylist?

494
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,880
Who is it?

495
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,560
The best makeup artist in China, Bai Bo.

496
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,360
Bai Bo?

497
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,080
The one who participated in

498
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
the international film festival

499
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,480
red carpet design,

500
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,320
Bai Bo?

501
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,560
Yes.

502
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,520
It's impossible to compare.

503
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm just an ordinary

504
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,960
makeup artist.

505
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,400
Do you know how many big feet

506
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,240
he has won?

507
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,360
I knew it.

508
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,160
This is not a fair competition.

509
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,600
It's okay.

510
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,080
Just do the same

511
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,880
as you usually do.

512
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,040
As usual?

513
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,000
Yes.

514
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,240
How can I win the usual makeup?

515
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,880
Try to make it clean.

516
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,160
I want the simple

517
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,320
youthful Republic style.

518
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,760
Simple?

519
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,320
I see.

520
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,320
Ji Qing will definitely

521
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,440
do it very elegantly.

522
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,760
And the simple style we do

523
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,000
will be more attractive.

524
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,160
Is that what you mean?

525
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,920
There will be a lot of people

526
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,840
waiting outside.

527
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,320
Maybe the simple style

528
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,240
will be more attractive.

529
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,720
So delicate.

530
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,960
Let's get started.

531
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,960
You have to be faster.

532
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
Only 20 minutes left.

533
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,680
Don't worry.

534
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,680
I will definitely

535
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,280
make Ji Qing win.

536
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,120
Ji Qing, you are so beautiful.

537
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,440
That Jian Xi

538
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,400
is nothing like her.

539
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,040
The heroine of today's audition

540
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
is definitely you.

541
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,120
Teacher.

542
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,680
You can't win like this.

543
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,040
Ji Qing's makeup is very successful.

544
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,480
You will definitely lose.

545
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,680
But we only have

546
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,520
a few minutes left.

547
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,600
It's too late to change the makeup.

548
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,520
What do you mean?

549
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,600
Are you going to give up?

550
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,840
Mr. Yu said

551
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
every actress who comes to the audition

552
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,280
should be prepared.

553
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
After an hour,

554
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,440
the one who leaves the deepest impression

555
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,640
is the heroine of the rose life.

556
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,480
An Xi.

557
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,280
Do you remember

558
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,840
what the staff said?

559
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,320
What?

560
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,800
The one who left the deepest impression.

561
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,760
I remember.

562
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,400
What's wrong?

563
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
Help me change the makeup.

564
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,080
It's too short.

565
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,760
There is no way to make a big change.

566
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,920
Teacher.

567
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,680
Can you delay it for me for ten minutes?

568
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,200
Ten minutes.

569
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,240
Yes.

570
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,960
No problem.

571
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,200
I'll wait for you in the audition hall.

572
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,200
Thank you, teacher.

573
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,200
Is this really okay?

574
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,320
I believe it.

575
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,520
It must be okay.

576
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,960
Hurry up.

577
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:11,320
і

578
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,800
It grabs your heart.

579
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,920
It's Ji��.

580
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,840
Why is she soє

581
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,040
moveó

582
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,560
Take good care of her TODAY.

583
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Yes, the old and the new.

584
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
It's natural.

585
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Let's give up on ourselves.

586
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
I'm really giving up.

587
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
I'm so tired.

588
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
How can I see it?

589
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Wait.

590
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
I don't know.

591
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Let's go.

592
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Let's go.

593
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Miss Ji is indeed as the night said.

594
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
A beautiful girl.

595
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Mr. Yu.

596
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
I've seen the script of Rose's life.

597
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I especially like the role of Yun Duo.

598
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Can you give me the leading role?

599
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Is everyone here?

600
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Jian Xi is not here yet.

601
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
I said it.

602
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
You can't go.

603
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
I'm not going.

604
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm not going.

605
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
I'm not going.

606
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
I'm not going.

607
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
I'm not going.

608
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
I'm not going.

609
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
I'm not going.

610
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
We agreed to be together for an hour.

611
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
She's late.

612
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
If she's late, it means she's giving up.

613
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,560
The leading role of Rose's life is our Ji Qing.

614
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
Actually, I really want to see you two beautiful girls

615
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
competing in the field together.

616
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Mr. Yu.

617
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Lu Zhou.

618
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Long time no see.

619
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Long time no see.

620
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Long time no see.

621
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
I didn't expect you to be the producer of Rose's life.

622
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
I should have come to visit you earlier.

623
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
I should have come to visit you earlier.

624
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
No.

625
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
You said we had a good cooperation.

626
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
We should cooperate if we have a chance.

627
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
We must.

628
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,560
You did help me a lot in my professional career.

629
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Come on.

630
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
I'll treat you to a meal.

631
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
It's a thank you to the past.

632
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
We must.

633
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Don't interrupt.

634
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
Mr. Yu.

635
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Shouldn't we have decided this as soon as possible?

636
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Why are you so rude?

637
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
I'm sorry.

638
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
I made you wait for a long time.

639
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Is this Jiaxin?

640
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
Why did she become like this?

641
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Why is she so beautiful?

642
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Is she a fairy?

643
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
I'm so embarrassed.

644
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Jiaxin, let's start.

645
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
I'm so scared.

646
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Why does she look so ugly?

647
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
I think she's so beautiful.

648
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
She's so beautiful.

649
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
She's so beautiful.

650
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
I think she's a fairy.

651
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Why is she so beautiful?

652
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Why is she so beautiful?

653
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Why is she so beautiful?

654
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
This is...

655
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Look.

656
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Look.

657
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Look.

658
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Thats it?

659
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,560
La la la la la, la la la.

660
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
La la la la la...

661
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,560
La la la la la, la la.

662
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Just like this and they had a round of applause.

663
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Just like this and they had a round of applause.

664
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Your coverалh shape and your performance are great today.

665
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Your covera h shape and your performance are great today.

666
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
Thank you.

667
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Thank you. Then am I the most impressive actress you remember?

668
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,560
You can say that. You are really too beautiful today.

669
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,560
A beautiful love story and a scary horror movie.

670
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Who left the most impressive impression on you?

671
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,560
The result is still up to you.

672
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
What do you mean?

673
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
You are so beautiful that you are so embarrassed to be on stage.

674
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,560
No. He is right.

675
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:21,560
As a producer, it is the most important to make the audience remember the movie.

676
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,560
In this crowd-spouting hall,

677
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,560
there is only one person who is eye-catching.

678
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
You are really great today.

679
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Then may I ask, can I act in your movie?

680
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,560
I can definitely act very well.

681
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Welcome.

682
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Thank you.

683
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,560
Thank you.

684
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Ji Qin! Ji Qin!

685
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Ji Qin!

686
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Ji Qin!

687
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Ji Qin!

688
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Ji Qin!

689
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,560
Ji Qin!

690
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,600
After I looked.

691
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,960
Say that you have gone off in the sound of Co不講

692
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,200
After saw short

693
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Can my post

694
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,940
The taste of

695
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,600
Since you return home,

696
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,300
you shouldn't keep anymore secrets from me!

697
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,860
Do you plan to return again?

698
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,740
Are you really going to leave?

699
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,540
Of course!

700
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,560
But later in the future,

701
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,900
I may wear a mask or later be in the dark.

702
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,560
So I can be moreन

703
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,940
but I also plan to help you,

704
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,900
let me accompany you by helping the person in the dark.

705
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,460
In this world,

706
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,180
you're different.

707
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,180
I'm sorry.

708
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Ji Qing.

709
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,180
I know everything that happened today.

710
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
I'm so sad.

711
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,180
I'm really so sad.

712
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,180
I thought I would win.

713
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
Why did I fail again?

714
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,180
I really tried hard.

715
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,180
You know what?

716
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,180
Since he appeared,

717
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,180
he took everything I had.

718
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
I thought...

719
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,180
I thought I would be very proud.

720
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,180
When I was sending De Lin and Rong Lin,

721
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,180
I kept telling myself

722
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
that no matter what,

723
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
I have to endure it.

724
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,180
I can reconcile with him.

725
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,180
But I found that I couldn't do it.

726
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,180
What should I do?

727
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
It's okay.

728
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,180
It's really okay.

729
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,180
It's all human nature.

730
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,180
Everyone says I'm a goddess.

731
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,180
Actually, I'm not.

732
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,180
I'm just like other people.

733
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,180
I'm sad.

734
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
I'm heartbroken.

735
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
When I saw

736
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,180
that Consort Tang liked him so much,

737
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
when I saw the heroine

738
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
being taken away by him,

739
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
I really didn't know what to do.

740
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,180
I didn't know what to do.

741
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,180
What should I do?

742
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,180
No matter what you become,

743
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,180
I'll always be by your side.

744
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
Heroine,

745
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,180
Consort Tang,

746
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,180
as long as you want it,

747
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,180
I'll get it all back for you.

748
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180
All of it.

749
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,180
You have to believe me, okay?

750
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
I'm sorry.

751
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,180
Go back and recuperate.

752
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,180
I'll withdraw this manuscript.

753
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,180
You're asking someone to investigate me?

754
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,180
I'm just concerned about

755
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,180
my wife and son's health.

756
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,180
As an economy company,

757
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,180
you don't care about your career.

758
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,180
Are you going to tell everyone

759
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
about my illness?

760
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,180
You're wrong.

761
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
It's because I have a professional professional.

762
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,180
So before the matter is revealed,

763
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,180
I want to announce to everyone.

764
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
As your eyes,

765
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
being sick is also a kind of mistake.

766
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,180
Of course, being sick is not wrong.

767
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,180
But you're sick,

768
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
and you deliberately hide it from the company.

769
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,180
Of course, there's a problem.

770
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,180
Okay.

771
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,180
You can work.

772
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,180
I don't care.

773
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,180
Does the medical producer know your condition?

774
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,180
As far as I know,

775
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
your condition is constantly deteriorating.

776
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,180
You should suffer a lot of pain.

777
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,180
If you suddenly live in the hospital

778
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
after shooting half of it,

779
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,180
the crew will be exposed.

780
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,180
This movie is scheduled to be released.

781
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,180
I will finish it.

782
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,180
You're still so naive.

783
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
Even if I believe you,

784
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,180
the producer will believe you.

785
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,180
You're not only irresponsible to yourself,

786
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,180
but also irresponsible to the movie.

787
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,180
Mr. Qi,

788
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,180
what do you want?

789
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,180
What do you want?

790
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
The press conference tomorrow afternoon

791
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
will officially be canceled

792
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,180
and the show will be temporarily canceled.

793
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
You're too much.

794
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,180
I'm doing this for your own good.

795
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
Think about it.

796
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
Go back and get well.

797
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
After a few years,

798
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
maybe you can still come out to shoot.

799
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,180
But if you fall down during the shooting,

800
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,180
what will people think?

801
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,180
Is this a stir or a kind of deception?

802
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,180
I believe the audience

803
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
will not forgive this kind of person easily.

804
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,180
The press conference at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon

805
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
I want to see you

806
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
and announce the cancellation.

807
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,180
Mr. Qi,

808
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,180
go out.

809
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
What disease do you have?

810
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,180
I'm fine.

811
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,180
I...

812
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,180
I haven't finished yet.

813
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
I'm your boyfriend.

814
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,180
Can you tell me

815
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,180
what's going on?

816
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Don't let me know

817
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,180
what you know from others, okay?

818
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,180
You're an actress too.

819
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,180
You should know.

820
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,180
I don't know. I don't know anything.

821
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,180
You never tell me.

822
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,180
How can I tell you?

823
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
I'm not telling you.

824
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,180
I'm telling you.

825
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,180
I'm telling you.

826
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,180
I'm telling you.

827
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,180
I'm telling you.

828
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,180
How can I tell you?

829
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,180
What should I tell you?

830
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
I'm telling you that I have a strange disease.

831
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
If I don't cure it,

832
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,180
my spine will deform.

833
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
And maybe the shoulders are not balanced.

834
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
It's even more serious.

835
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
Jinxin,

836
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,180
since it's so serious,

837
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
why don't you treat it?

838
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
I want to shoot the rose-tree man.

839
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,180
I know.

840
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,180
I've always supported you.

841
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
I support your acting.

842
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,180
But this time,

843
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,180
I don't think there's anything

844
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,180
that can surpass your health.

845
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
Let's stop acting.

846
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
I'll take you to the hospital.

847
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,180
I'll take you to the best doctor.

848
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
It's my business.

849
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,180
I'll decide it myself.

850
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
I want to act.

851
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,180
You can't stop me.

852
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
I know you're still young.

853
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,180
So we should cure the disease.

854
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
Cure it?

855
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,180
How to cure it?

856
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,180
Even if I take the operation now,

857
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,180
I may have a post-op.

858
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,180
The doctor asked me to take the medicine.

859
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
How long does it take?

860
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
One year?

861
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
Two years?

862
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,180
Or three years?

863
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,180
Do you know

864
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,180
how long a actress' golden period is?

865
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
If the operation fails,

866
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
I can't stand up again.

867
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,180
My spine will deform.

868
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
Then I can't act anymore.

869
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,180
Instead,

870
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,180
I choose to leave the most precious memory.

871
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,180
I hope you can understand me.

872
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,180
I'm sorry.

873
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
What is he doing?

874
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,180
Is it that way to the room?

875
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,180
It's a car-to-car road.

876
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,180
He's afraid that the dog is in danger.

877
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,180
So he goes with the dog.

878
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,180
If the driver sees a new dog,

879
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
he will speed up in advance.

880
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,180
No way!

881
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,180
No way!

882
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
The dog is in danger!

883
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
The dog is in danger!

884
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,180
The dog is in danger!

885
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
The dog is in danger!

886
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,180
The dog is in danger!

887
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
The dog is in danger!

888
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
He's gone too far with the dog.

889
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,180
He's really stupid.

890
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,180
Really?

891
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
But it's not the first time

892
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,180
that he did something like that.

893
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
Then why do you like him?

894
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,180
The producer of Rose's Life.

895
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,180
What's wrong?

896
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
Didn't you say

897
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,180
you don't like this film?

898
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,180
Let me read the script first.

899
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,180
Okay.

900
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Wait a minute.

901
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
I'll contact you.

902
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,180
For a little while.

903
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
You'll be fine later.

904
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,180
Wait for me in the previously recorded script.

905
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,180
Okay.

906
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,180
See you.

907
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,180
Mister percent percent.

908
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,900
That's fine,

909
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
why did you blow sound from the street so loudly?

910
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
I didn't push it.

911
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
No one's male character.

912
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,180
No one is shy.

913
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,180
It's too slow,

914
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
you know?

915
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,580
I'll decide for myself.

916
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,020
I want to act.

917
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,420
You can't stop me.

918
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,780
Where's the toilet?

919
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,780
Excuse me.

920
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:00,820
Okay.

921
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,540
Excuse me.

922
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,140
Please.

923
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,940
Thank you.

924
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,020
Please.

925
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,100
Wait for me there.

926
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:22,660
Okay.

927
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,420
I knew you'd come.

928
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,340
I was looking forward to your farewell speech.

929
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,780
Don't look at me like that.

930
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,340
Jianxi.

931
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,820
Thank you.

932
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:49,740
Right.

933
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,980
Last time, Jianxi left me a deep message.

934
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,380
I'm looking forward to her performance.

935
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,020
Mr. Qi.

936
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,820
Yu Zhi.

937
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,540
Long time no see.

938
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,700
You've decorated it beautifully.

939
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,940
Hello, Mr. Qi.

940
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,660
It's a pleasure to see you.

941
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,580
Come on.

942
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,380
Sit down.

943
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:05,980
Take a seat.

944
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,660
Come on.

945
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,540
Jianxi.

946
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,580
Why are you still here?

947
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,420
Yu Zhi has been looking for you.

948
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,540
Let's go in.

949
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,620
I...

950
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,380
What's wrong?

951
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,580
Okay.

952
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,220
Go in first.

953
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,900
We'll talk later.

954
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:32,980
Excuse me.

955
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,060
Can I borrow your bag?

956
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,060
There might be a key in the bag.

957
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,460
Okay.

958
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,700
It's affecting the security.

959
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,380
Excuse me.

960
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,020
It's okay.

961
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,660
Please.

962
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,420
Thank you.

963
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,260
What's wrong?

964
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,380
Nothing serious.

965
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,500
Let's get started.

966
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,300
Hurry up.

967
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,140
Wait.

968
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,580
I have something to announce.

969
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:54,660
Come here.

970
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,460
Jianxi has something to announce.

971
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,300
What's going on?

972
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:56,940
What's going on?

973
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,540

00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,300
Tell us.

975
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,220
Tell us.

976
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,700
This is the real reason why the security guards want to do this.

977
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,500
Isn't this a...

978
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,180
Usually,

979
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,220
Who's in it?

980
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,700
I always bring it with me.

981
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,180
I put it in my bag today.

982
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,180
What's this?

983
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:11,900
Yeah.

00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,620
Jianxi.

985
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,780
This is a medical syringe.

986
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,820
Why is it on you?

987
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,620
Are you sick?

988
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,100
Yeah.

989
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,020
What's wrong with you?

990
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,900
Why are you bringing a syringe here?

991
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,500
Yeah.

992
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,100
If you're sick,

993
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,340
it'll affect the shooting of the rose life.

994
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,140
Who's not sick?

995
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,300

999
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,100
