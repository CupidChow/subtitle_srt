1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Miss you

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Love you

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far away

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
At that moment

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
A long age

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,240
Turned into a magical eye

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,920
Pass through the loneliness to find you

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,040
Wear the most solid gold armor

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,920
Hold the weapon in your hand

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Use all your strength to fight for the most real self

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the little thing is

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what rumors

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,080
I will definitely be invincible

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,360
I don't want

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't want

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Where is the gold?

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,400
In the past, I kept the sweet

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,760
No matter where your heart is

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,080
My heart is here

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
Even if the iron armor is invincible

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm only one you

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Episode 16

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Shen Yan

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
Kluo

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,600
Have you never noticed me?

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,760
I'm sorry

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,200
It's all my fault

36
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
It's all my fault

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,720
I shouldn't have liked you

38
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,440
Anyway

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,680
I'll go buy some medicine with you

40
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Thank you

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
I'll go buy some medicine with you

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,800
Thank you

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,960
I'll go buy some medicine with you

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,040
Are you caring about me?

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,840
We are friends

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,400
What I want

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,360
Not just friends

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Can you

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,240
Have a little bit

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,360
Like me

51
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,040
As long as I can be by your side

52
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,440
Even if I'm the substitute

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
I will put you in the top position.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
You can continue to like him.

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
But...

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,040
As long as you don't reject my heart.

57
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,440
You are so stupid.

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
This Zuo Zuo is so vicious.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
How dare he hit you like this?

60
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Shen Yan.

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
You go out first.

62
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
You did it on purpose, right?

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I don't understand what you are saying.

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
You don't understand?

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
You are deliberately letting Ke Lu see that scene.

66
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,840
You are deliberately pretending to be pitiful in front of him.

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Then I have to thank you for giving me a chance.

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,840
If it wasn't for you, how could I become Ke Lu's girlfriend?

69
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Your slap has taken away all my bad luck.

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
What did you say?

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
What girlfriend?

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,840
From today on, I am the famous singer, Ke Lu's girlfriend.

73
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,840
I warned you not to bother me again.

74
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,840
You forgot everything.

75
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,840
From today on, I will not be concerned about the Zuo family anymore.

76
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
Let's wait and see.

77
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
What's wrong with your face?

78
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Let me see.

79
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
It's a bit swollen.

80
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
What happened?

81
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Zuo Zuo hit me.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,840
Zuo Zuo hit you?

83
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Zuo Zuo hit you?

84
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Zuo Zuo hit me.

85
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
Zuo Zuo hit you?

86
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Yes.

87
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
He doesn't like me.

88
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
He often bullies me in the film studio.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
There is such a thing?

90
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I have an investment in this film.

91
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
The producers have to listen to me.

92
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
Don't worry.

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
I will help you get rid of this matter.

94
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Then you fire him.

95
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
This is not good.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
The movie has already started.

97
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
You can't change the female lead at this time.

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
What are you going to do?

99
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
How about this?

100
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
I will buy you a car.

101
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Or take you to Europe to play.

102
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
If you really love me,

103
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,840
you will let the director increase the drama of Mo Li.

104
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Although Zuo Zuo is a female doctor,

105
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
I want to be a female doctor who has already been.

106
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Okay.

107
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
No problem.

108
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
I promise you.

109
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
You are the best to me.

110
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Thank you, director Ji.

111
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Come on.

112
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
It's good that you know.

113
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Don't be so sad in front of me in the future.

114
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
I will feel sad.

115
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Come on.

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Aunt.

117
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Tang Fei is very busy recently.

118
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Maybe he doesn't have time to see you.

119
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Aunt.

120
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Don't worry.

121
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
I will come to see you when I have time.

122
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Aunt.

123
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,840
You don't look like Tang Fei at all.

124
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
You are so beautiful.

125
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
So gentle.

126
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Tang Fei.

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
He is a heartless man.

128
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
He likes to touch others.

129
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
But he is not in a good mood recently.

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
I want to do something for him.

131
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
But I can do too little.

132
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Aunt.

133
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Let me tell you a secret.

134
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Your novel is going to be changed into a movie.

135
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
I have been persuading Tang Fei to be the leading actor.

136
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Are you happy?

137
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,840
I think he should let go of the grudges between him and his father.

138
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
He should help his mother to fulfill her wish first.

139
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Help his mother to fulfill her wish.

140
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Her work can be changed into a movie.

141
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Let more people appreciate it.

142
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Is it your novel's wish?

143
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,840
But Tang Fei never understands me.

144
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,840
In this matter, I am much cuter than him.

145
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Right?

146
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Why are you so brazen?

147
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
Mom.

148
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
How are you today?

149
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
I am fine.

150
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
I made chicken soup for aunt.

151
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Drink it while it's hot.

152
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
She is going to have a check-up soon.

153
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
She can't eat it now.

154
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,840
But the soup will cool down in an hour.

155
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Mom.

156
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
You can't drink it.

157
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
You can't drink it.

158
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
You can't drink it.

159
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
What soup are you making?

160
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Chicken soup.

161
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Have a look.

162
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
You are weird.

163
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Am I weird?

164
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
I just put some cinnamon.

165
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
How is it?

166
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Okay.

167
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Really?

168
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
Let me taste it.

169
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
It's my first time making it.

170
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
I don't know what it tastes like.

171
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Why don't you taste it and let your mom taste it?

172
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
I made it.

173
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
I will drink it all.

174
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
Don't drink it alone.

175
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
I will drink it all.

176
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
I will drink it all.

177
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
I will drink it all.

178
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
I will drink it all.

179
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
I will drink it all.

180
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
I will drink it all.

181
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
You drank it all alone.

182
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Give it to me.

183
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Give it to me.

184
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
I will make it better next time.

185
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
You can drink it after I finish the check-up.

186
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Okay?

187
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
After the check-up, it's all yours.

188
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
You can't drink it now.

189
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Be good.

190
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Let me taste it.

191
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Give it to me.

192
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Cut.

193
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Here.

194
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Are you okay?

195
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Fei.

196
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Fei.

197
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Fei.

198
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Fei.

199
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
You went too far.

200
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
I didn't stand still just now.

201
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
How can you let go?

202
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Okay.

203
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
I saw that you were leaning on Tang Fei.

204
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,840
If you don't have bones, who can you blame?

205
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
You...

206
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Why are the photos in your hands?

207
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Didn't you make a loud noise just now?

208
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Make it louder.

209
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Make it louder.

210
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
You...

211
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Remember to be clean next time you expose it.

212
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
I haven't finished yet.

213
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
I know.

214
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Your relationship with Mr. Ji is extraordinary.

215
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Although I've been adding more details to your work,

216
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
every profession needs to rely on strength to speak.

217
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
If you don't show some outstanding work,

218
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
you won't be able to go far.

219
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Before the power is stable,

220
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,840
don't think about how to harm others and defeat them.

221
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Learn more about the inner work.

222
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
That inner work...

223
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Don't cry in front of me.

224
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
I'm not the Great Wall. You can't cry.

225
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Save your tears for Mr. Ji.

226
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Get lost.

227
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Where are you going?

228
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
The shooting site.

229
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Which shooting site?

230
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
What do you think?

231
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
I don't have a clue.

232
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
I don't know what to do.

233
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Can you stop acting like a heroine today?

234
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Do you know you've wasted a lot of my time?

235
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
What attitude is that?

236
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
What attitude?

237
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,840
A heroine should act like a heroine.

238
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
What's the point of acting like a heroine?

239
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Why are you so mean?

240
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Listen,

241
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
if you act like a heroine again today,

242
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
you can act like a heroine yourself.

243
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Don't mind what others say.

244
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm fine.

245
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Really?

246
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I...

247
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
I want to walk alone.

248
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
I'll walk with you.

249
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
No need.

250
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Mai Xin.

251
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Tang Fei, why are you here?

252
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm here to visit.

253
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Where is she?

254
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
She's not in a good mood.

255
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
She's not in a good state either.

256
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Jingxin.

257
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
What's wrong?

258
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Why are you here alone?

259
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
No matter what problem you encounter,

260
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
you're hiding yourself like this.

261
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Is it useless?

262
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
The shoot is about to start.

263
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Hurry up and go.

264
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I'm not going.

265
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Jingxin.

266
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Tell me why.

267
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I can't continue acting.

268
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
You were confident before.

269
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Why did it happen?

270
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
I still can't get over Chang Fei.

271
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Don't tell me you're giving up.

272
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
You finally made it this far.

273
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
But I really can't do it.

274
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
What can't you do?

275
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
To surpass him.

276
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Who?

277
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
My passion.

278
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
To surpass my passion.

279
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,840
The teacher asked me to get the best female lead in Phoenix Film Festival.

280
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
I can't get it.

281
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
It's Lu Zhou again, right?

282
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
No matter how hard I try,

283
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
I can't surpass my passion.

284
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Why did you choose to act?

285
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
Because I like it.

286
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I want to pursue my dream.

287
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
I want to pursue my dream.

288
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
And then pass this feeling to everyone.

289
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
So that everyone will feel happy.

290
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
You said you like it.

291
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Then why don't you focus on acting?

292
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
What do you mean?

293
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Actually, walking on the path of an actor

294
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
is like climbing a mountain.

295
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
At first,

296
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
everyone was looking at the mountain foot.

297
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Everyone had a dream.

298
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Then they tried to climb the mountain.

299
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Then they encountered various obstacles.

300
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
And finally reached the peak.

301
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
I know Lu Zhou wants you to climb to the peak

302
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840
at the fastest speed to fulfill his dream.

303
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
But for you,

304
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
it may not be a good thing.

305
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Why?

306
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Your teacher also won the film.

307
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Do you think he is happy?

308
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
I also won it.

309
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Although I laugh at you every day,

310
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
do you think I am happy?

311
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
When you really get to that position,

312
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
you will be more worried and afraid.

313
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Every day, you can say that you are worried and afraid.

314
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Actually, sometimes I think that

315
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
I was always going forward.

316
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
I really ignored many scenery around me.

317
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840
I even forgot what my situation was.

318
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Close your eyes.

319
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Relax.

320
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Now you can't see.

321
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Listen carefully.

322
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Do you hear the wind?

323
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Do you hear the sound of the bird's call?

324
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Do you hear the sound of the river next to you?

325
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Now you are the only one left in the world.

326
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
No matter what the film industry is,

327
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
no matter what the country is,

328
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
only you.

329
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
And you are now Zhang Fei.

330
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Now, let's see what you have yet to fulfill your dream.

331
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
What kind of people you haven't seen yet.

332
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
What kind of things you haven't done yet.

333
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Take a deep breath.

334
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Relax.

335
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
The sun is rising.

336
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
The sun is rising.

337
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Director, we are ready.

338
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Ready.

339
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Eighteen times.

340
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Action.

341
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,840
It turns out that Ji Jie likes dancing the most.

342
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,840
He went to study medicine because of me.

343
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Right?

344
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
What is Jian Xi doing?

345
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Guess what this diagonal line Is?

346
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:44,840
This line is the

347
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
smooth toothed dancing.

348
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
It's unusual.

349
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Okay.

350
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,600
I won't let koşa break...

351
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,520
Okay.

352
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,200
I'm going to change his hand now.

353
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:02,720
Alright.

354
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,960
Lan Yan, look.

355
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,960
Tang Fei is here.

356
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,120
draft

357
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,120
But after all, he is an kicks aussi étantward patient.

358
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,040
Then in a while, he can no longer move.

359
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,000
So he authorities such?

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,840
So he authorities such?

361
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,920
So he authorities such?

362
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,560
Therefore, it's important to produce art.

363
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,440
But that is really it.

364
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,340
Wait.

365
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,760
Let's see.

366
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Xiao Fei, are you okay?

367
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Xiao Fei, are you okay?

368
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
I'm fine.

369
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
It doesn't hurt at all.

370
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
I can't walk.

371
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
My knees are my legs.

372
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Sister, you accompany me to see a doctor.

373
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
I can accompany you to dance.

374
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
I can dance.

375
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Xiao Fei, are you okay?

376
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
I'm fine.

377
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm fine.

378
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Xiao Fei, are you okay?

379
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
I'm fine.

380
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Xiao Fei, are you okay?

381
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
I can accompany you to dance.

382
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Cut. Pass.

383
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Let's look at it again.

384
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Come on.

385
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Congratulations, Mia and Jian Xi.

386
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
Thank you.

387
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,840
The fall just now was deliberate.

388
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
How could it be like this?

389
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,840
If it was a normal ALS patient,

390
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
it is impossible to use a wheelchair to dance.

391
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
This is just Jian Xi's artistic processing.

392
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
But he is afraid that the artistic processing is too much.

393
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
So he fell and returned to reality.

394
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,840
But in fact, he expressed his attitude.

395
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,840
When a person's body is advanced,

396
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
is his mind and spirit more free and free?

397
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Of course, I also think that

398
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
this dance appears in this scene.

399
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Will it seem a little bit crude?

400
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
No.

401
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,840
I want to add this dance of Jian Xi

402
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,840
into his dream.

403
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Okay, okay.

404
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
That's okay.

405
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
You played well.

406
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Thank you.

407
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Are you mocking me?

408
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,840
The wheelchair performance just now was an impromptu performance.

409
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Thanks to you, you reacted quickly

410
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
and danced with me.

411
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Thank you.

412
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Happy cooperation.

413
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Happy cooperation.

414
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
You played well.

415
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Keep working hard.

416
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
Thank you, teacher.

417
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Jian Xi, you played well.

418
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
An Xi, did you see Tang Fei?

419
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
He went to work.

420
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
What's wrong?

421
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Nothing.

422
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
I'm going to prepare for the next scene.

423
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
Come on.

424
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
I said you are really

425
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,840
taking a good picture and coming back to visit the class.

426
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840
What are you thinking?

427
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,840
If the reporter takes a picture and writes it out,

428
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
you may not be able to suppress it every time.

429
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
What can they write?

430
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Just write that Tang Fei fell in love with Jian Xi.

431
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
It's true.

432
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
That's right.

433
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
What did you say?

434
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
It's time to expose it.

435
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
This is their job.

436
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
Can't actors fall in love?

437
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
You are in love.

438
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Are you sure?

439
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
You didn't tell me.

440
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
We are friends.

441
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
I am your agent.

442
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,840
Why didn't you tell me?

443
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,840
It's a big deal.

444
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Don't be so excited.

445
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Let me remind you.

446
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Your affair with Ji Qing hasn't ended yet.

447
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
I know.

448
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840
I will end it as soon as possible.

449
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
But don't forget.

450
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,840
We have a deal with Qi Wen Sen.

451
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
It will cost a lot.

452
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
One month.

453
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,840
I will clarify my relationship with Ji Qing.

454
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
But...

455
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Where is the shooting site?

456
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Tang Fei.

457
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
I know you want to end it now.

458
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
But...

459
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Let's take it slow.

460
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
Enough.

461
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Let's go.

462
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
Tang Fei.

463
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
What?

464
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
It's always like this.

465
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Ji Qing.

466
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
These are all gifts for you.

467
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,840
Thank you.

468
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Ji Qing, look.

469
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
So cute.

470
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
So cute.

471
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
What's wrong?

472
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Get the medicine box.

473
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Hurry.

474
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
I will go now.

475
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
Go over there.

476
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Does it hurt?

477
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
It hurts.

478
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
What's wrong?

479
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Tang Fei.

480
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Someone is causing trouble.

481
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Xiaoxiao is hurt.

482
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Be careful.

483
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Be careful.

484
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
Look.

485
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
She threatened Ji Qing.

486
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
She asked him to break up with you.

487
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
She must be a crazy fan.

488
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I am lucky to be hurt this time.

489
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
If it was Ji Qing,

490
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
how could she shoot a play?

491
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
I am sorry.

492
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
It's all because of me

493
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
that you suffered so much.

494
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
It's okay.

495
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
It's not your fault.

496
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
I am a little confused now.

497
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
Is this Ji Qing's fan

498
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,840
or Tang Fei's fan?

499
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Is this important?

500
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
If this is Tang Fei's fan,

501
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
it's extremely important.

502
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
If this is Ji Qing's fan,

503
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
it's the same as

504
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
the famous actor

505
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
Liu Lin encountered.

506
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
It's the same as the past.

507
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
It's like you forever.

508
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
No matter who's fan it is,

509
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
it's all because of this scandal.

510
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
I wanted to get married to the media

511
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
in a month.

512
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
But now I think

513
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
we should make it clear sooner.

514
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Make it clear what?

515
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Make it clear that

516
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
we are not boyfriends.

517
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
After making it clear,

518
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
the problem can be solved completely.

519
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
And your popularity

520
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
has risen rapidly.

521
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,840
You don't need to use this way

522
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
to increase your exposure rate.

523
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
No, don't say it out.

524
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
The main reason is that

525
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,840
the film is almost finished.

526
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,840
And this film is going to be exhibited.

527
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
So I'm afraid

528
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
it will affect my image.

529
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
To clarify this relationship,

530
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
on the one hand,

531
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
it's to avoid the same thing

532
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
from happening again.

533
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
On the other hand,

534
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
it can also increase the exposure rate.

535
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
And it can also increase the exposure rate.

536
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
It's a good way to promote your film.

537
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
It's a great help to you.

538
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
But will he believe it?

539
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Yes.

540
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
The gift just arrived here.

541
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
You immediately denied it to the press.

542
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
People will think you are hiding something.

543
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
I'm afraid

544
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
you will do something more terrible.

545
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
So the priority is

546
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
to find out the person who sent the package.

547
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
And I'm afraid...

548
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
He will hurt Tang Fei?

549
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Yes.

550
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
I think

551
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
Ji Qing is right.

552
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
I think

553
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
the person who sent the package

554
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
must have a problem with his brain.

555
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
If his next target is you,

556
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
the consequences will be unimaginable.

557
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,840
I think we should call the police.

558
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
I agree with you.

559
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
But we should handle it in a low profile.

560
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
I don't want to alert too many people.

561
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
Tang Fei,

562
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
I have a bad feeling.

563
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
You must be careful.

564
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Coming.

565
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Coming.

566
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Someone sent a gift.

567
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
But I don't know who sent it.

568
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
The person who just went out left.

569
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Such a big box

570
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
should be a toy.

571
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
Put it down.

572
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Why did you touch my stuff?

573
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
I...

574
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
I didn't touch it.

575
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
I just want to know

576
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
if you are really the person who sent it.

577
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
I'm not the person who sent it.

578
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
I'm the person who sent it.

579
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
What's that?

580
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
I...

581
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
I just want to help you

582
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
to open the bag.

583
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
That's for me.

584
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Please don't make your own decision.

585
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
You don't know.

586
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
What are you doing?

587
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
I won't open it.

588
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Why are you so angry?

589
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
I just want to help.

590
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840
No one peeped at your stuff.

591
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
From now on,

592
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
I don't need you

593
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
to clean my house.

594
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
What do you mean?

595
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
I have found

596
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
a new police station.

597
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
From now on,

598
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
wherever you go,

599
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
please don't come to my house.

600
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
But...

601
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Our contract hasn't expired yet.

602
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Not only that,

603
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
from now on,

604
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
I don't know you.

605
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
You can't call me.

606
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Did I do something wrong?

607
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Because you are too troublesome.

608
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
Troublesome?

609
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
You know what?

610
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Shen Ye has sent me and your photos

611
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
to the media.

612
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
If I hadn't stopped him,

613
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
things would have been a mess.

614
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
You still think I'm not enough?

615
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Listen,

616
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
I don't want my career

617
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
to be ruined because of you.

618
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
I...

619
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Do you understand?

620
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Can we go now?

621
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Let's go.

622
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Tang Fei.

623
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Tang Fei.

624
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
You are too much.

625
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
My bag.

626
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Why?

627
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
She will misunderstand you.

628
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm doing this for her.

629
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
You...

630
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
What are you doing?

631
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
I'll clean it up.

632
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
I'll clean it up.

633
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
No.

634
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Back off.

635
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Yu Le,

636
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
let me do it.

637
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Stay away from me.

638
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Stay away from me.

639
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Be careful.

640
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Be careful.

641
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
It's the blood stain.

642
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
He's crazy.

643
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
What are you doing?

644
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
I want to call the police.

645
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
It's useless.

646
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
We have prepared the case

647
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
in the police station today.

648
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
They don't have

649
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
any solid evidence.

650
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
They just think it's a joke.

651
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Okay, I'll find someone to protect you.

652
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
I don't need it.

653
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
I know you don't want to

654
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
make this a big deal.

655
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
But he sends gifts

656
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
again and again.

657
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
It's too scary.

658
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
I think he's not just

659
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
trying to scare me.

660
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
What do you mean?

661
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
Think about it.

662
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
How many people

663
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
know that I live here?

664
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
This place has not been

665
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
announced to the media.

666
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Only a few colleagues

667
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
and good friends know about it.

668
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Right.

669
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
How did he know about this place?

670
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
He even sent gifts himself.

671
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
So?

672
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
He has been following me.

673
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
He has been following me

674
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
from the movie theater to my house.

675
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
How did I not expect that?

676
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Find this person out quickly.

677
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
I want to solve this matter as soon as possible.

678
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Okay.

679
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Jinxi.

680
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Jinxi.

681
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
What are you thinking about?

682
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Anxin.

683
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Do you know

684
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
if Tang Fei

685
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
has been in trouble recently?

686
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
How would I know?

687
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
I think he's weird.

688
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
How is he weird?

689
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
He's weird.

690
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Tang Fei.

691
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
We haven't made it clear

692
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
about what happened last night.

693
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
I think I've made it clear.

694
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Even if the media has taken pictures of us,

695
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
and the pictures of us being ambiguous,

696
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
it won't affect your future at all.

697
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
This reason is unreasonable.

698
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
I always feel that you have something to hide from me.

699
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
What is it?

700
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
You mean you want to be my nanny

701
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
for 24 hours.

702
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
You want to be my bodyguard forever, right?

703
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
I don't think so.

704
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Since you don't think so,

705
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
I'll let you know that you're free now.

706
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
You can go now.

707
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Why is it so sudden?

708
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
I don't need to answer you everything.

709
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
That's all.

710
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Okay?

711
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
No, you...

712
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Let go of your hand.

713
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
You're really weird.

714
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Really weird.

715
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
I just received a package.

716
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Why do you look like a different person?

717
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Do you know you're so annoying?

718
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
How can a woman look like you?

719
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
I let you go today.

720
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
You still have a face to show.

721
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Do you want a face?

722
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Can you go now?

723
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Stay away from me, okay?

724
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
I don't want to see you again.

725
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
I thought...

726
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
You thought I like you, right?

727
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Yes, that's right.

728
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
I used to look for you

729
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
because I thought you were interesting.

730
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
I wanted to spend time with you.

731
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Now I don't want to.

732
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Can you go now?

733
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Do you want me to kick you out?

734
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
He treats you like this.

735
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
He's just too much.

736
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
He's too much.

737
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
You should be happy.

738
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
You should be happy.

739
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
You said he kicked you out.

740
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
You don't have to be a cow anymore.

741
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
You should be happy.

742
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Why are you depressed?

743
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
I just don't accept it.

744
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Why am I being called by him?

745
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Am I his dog?

746
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
What are you laughing at?

747
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,840
No one compares themselves to dogs.

748
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
No matter what the reason is, I'm angry.

749
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
You should be angry.

750
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
I ask you,

751
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,840
are you going to be with Tang Fei?

752
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
No way.

753
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,840
I can't like him.

754
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
I didn't say you like him.

755
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
You said it yourself.

756
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
I didn't say anything.

757
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Everyone, get ready to shoot.

758
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
No matter what the reason is,

759
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm going to shoot.

760
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
So cute.

761
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Sister Ji Qing,

762
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
someone is here to give you a gift.

763
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
It's okay now.

764
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
You can go.

765
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Ji Qing, you really can't stand it anymore.

766
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Who can stand such a terrible explosion every day?

767
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
I said it's okay.

768
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
I don't have to see it.

769
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
He didn't send it to the film studio.

770
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
He just sent it to your house.

771
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
It's nothing.

772
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Boss, Ji Qing, he...

773
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
President Qi.

774
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Don't open it.

775
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
What is this?

776
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
It's just a bad joke.

777
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
It's nothing.

778
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
And you told me,

779
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
being a female actor

780
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
should have good psychological quality.

781
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
You're already at this point.

782
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
You still want to lie to me?

783
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
I didn't.

784
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
I just told you,

785
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
you will tell my father.

786
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
He must be very worried.

787
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Then you have to take it alone, right?

788
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
It's not that serious.

789
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,840
No, it's nothing.

790
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
It's not up to you to decide if it's serious or not.

791
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
I will judge it.

792
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
What do you want?

793
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
This afternoon,

794
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Tang Fei will clarify your rumors to the public.

795
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
Qi Wen Sen,

796
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
you have no right to do this.

797
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
I don't agree.

798
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Of course you don't agree.

799
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
But Tang Fei proposed it himself.

800
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Xiao Xiao,

801
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
I will send someone to protect Ji Qing in the last few days.

802
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
You should cooperate.

803
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
Yes, don't ask someone to follow me.

804
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
I don't like it.

805
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Then what do you want?

806
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
I just need Xiao Xiao to accompany me.

807
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
I will pay attention to it.

808
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Ji Qing,

809
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
I don't want you to waste your time on this boring thing.

810
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,840
My 21 soul lessons are very important to the industry.

811
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
But I am very sure that

812
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,840
your dream love will be even better.

813
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
The best female lead of Phoenix Film Festival this year

814
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
is not you.

815
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Anyway,

816
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
don't ask someone to follow me.

817
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Forget it.

818
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
When Tang Fei clarifies the matter,

819
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
everything will be over.

820
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
Here is the thing.

821
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Ji Qing and I belong to the same film and television company.

822
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
So we often have the opportunity to cooperate.

823
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,840
Maybe we have worked together a lot.

824
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
So it is inevitable that we will have some misunderstandings.

825
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Ji Qing,

826
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
where are you?

827
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Ji Qing.

828
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Ji Qing.

829
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Ji Qing.

830
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Ji Qing.

831
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Brother Fei,

832
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
everyone knows that you are dating.

833
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
Why did you suddenly publish this news?

834
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840
I think it is to maintain a good relationship.

835
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,840
As for what will happen in the future,

836
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
no one knows.

837
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Sorry, everyone.

838
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
We can't answer the question anymore.

839
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Tang Fei has a notice.

840
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
We have to go.

841
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Sorry, everyone.

842
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Brother Fei.

843
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Brother Fei.

844
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Brother Fei.

845
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
Brother Fei.

846
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Tang Fei.

847
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Ji Qing is here.

848
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Ji Qing is here.

849
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Is this love?

850
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Is this love?

851
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Is this love?

852
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Is this love?

853
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Is this love?

854
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Is this love?

855
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Is this love?

856
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Brother Fei,

857
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
let me tell you.

858
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
Is this love?

859
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Is this love?

860
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,840
I want to tell everyone that

861
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
we love each other very much.

862
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Tang Fei just denied our relationship

863
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
to protect me.

864
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Because during this time,

865
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,840
I have been threatened by mysterious fans.

866
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Although I am very grateful for Tang Fei's love,

867
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I don't want to give up.

868
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
I want to take this opportunity

869
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
to tell the person behind the screen

870
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
that I truly love Tang Fei.

871
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,840
But I have never used any despicable means.

872
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Because I know

873
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
that is not love at all.

874
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
You are not an idol's cute fan,

875
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
but a despicable rat

876
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
who dares not to see people's dirty criminals.

877
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Tang Fei,

878
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I am not afraid of any attack or revenge.

879
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Because I love you.

880
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
I will take everything with you.

881
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
May I ask how that person threatened you?

882
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
You don't know who that person

883
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
who threatened you is?

884
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Isn't this Tang Fei?

885
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
And Ji Qin?

886
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
I just said that they are real.

887
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Look, look, he kissed her.

888
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
He really kissed her.

889
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
He really kissed her.

890
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Because during this time,

891
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,840
I have been threatened by mysterious fans.

892
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,840
Although I am very grateful for Tang Fei's love,

893
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
but I don't want to give up.

894
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
I want to take this opportunity

895
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
to tell the person behind the screen

896
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
that I really love her.

897
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,840
But I have never used any despicable means.

898
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Because I know

899
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
that is not love at all.

900
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
You are not an idol's cute fan,

901
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
but a despicable rat

902
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
who dares not to see people's dirty criminals.

903
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Tang Fei,

904
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
I am not afraid of any attack or revenge.

905
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
Because I love you.

906
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Ji Qin,

907
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
do you know what you have done?

908
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
This person's identity is not clear now.

909
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
What you did

910
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,840
is to focus the firepower on yourself.

911
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Yes, Ji Qin.

912
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Why did you do that?

913
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
I am sorry.

914
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
I have told you.

915
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
I will clarify the truth immediately.

916
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
But you deliberately provoked me.

917
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
I am really solving the problem.

918
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
After the interview,

919
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
I will tell you the truth.

920
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
After the interview,

921
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
she will definitely see it.

922
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
She will definitely think

923
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
that this woman is really annoying.

924
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
Not only does she not listen to my advice,

925
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,840
she also insists on being with Tang Fei.

926
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Then she will be unable to hold back

927
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
and take the initiative to find me.

928
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
You want to use yourself as bait?

929
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
No, this is too dangerous.

930
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
What else can we do?

931
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
She has been hiding like this

932
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
and has been looking down on us.

933
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,840
This is the most terrifying.

934
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
We have to think of a solution.

935
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
But I can't just let you

936
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
take the risk.

937
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
I am not innocent.

938
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
On the contrary,

939
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
I am trying to escape from violence.

940
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Tang Fei,

941
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,840
you have always ignored our relationship.

942
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,840
So you are helping me, right?

943
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
This is two different things.

944
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Since you have helped me,

945
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
I have to repay you.

946
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
So I will definitely help you

947
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
find the culprit.

948
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
You are really too much.

949
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,840
No one can stop me from making my decision.

950
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I still think

951
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
what you did is not good.

952
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,840
I am not asking for your opinion.

953
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
I am here to inform you

954
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,840
that I have decided to do this.

955
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,840
If you feel sorry,

956
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
then you should cooperate.

957
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
This way,

958
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
I won't waste my efforts.

959
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
Let's go.

960
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
Let's go.

961
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Let's go.

962
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
The four movies that are most

963
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
important in this year's Phoenix Film Festival

964
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
are

965
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Huo Jing's Nihong,

966
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
Ji Qing's Dream Love,

967
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
Zuo Zuo's Beauty,

968
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
and your

969
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
My Soul 21.

970
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
Huo Jing was the best actress last year.

971
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
She had very little chance of getting involved.

972
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,840
So the competition between the three of you

973
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
is very fierce.

974
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,840
So how much chance do we have to win?

975
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,840
One hundred percent.

976
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Why one hundred percent?

977
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
I am telling you,

978
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
the famous movie director,

979
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
Zhan Pingliang,

980
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
is the chairman of the judges

981
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
of this year's Phoenix Film Festival.

982
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
The other members

983
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
are the most outstanding

984
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,840
directors and producers.

985
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
This is the list.

986
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
There are seven people on it.

987
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
But if there are seven people,

988
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
why is our winning rate

989
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
only one percent?

990
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
And Jianxi acted so well.

991
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
We are a film production company.

992
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
The probability of winning

993
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
should be relatively low.

994
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
The probability of winning

995
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,840
should be relatively high.

996
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
Look carefully.

997
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Among these seven people,

998
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
there is actually a common point.

999
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
That is the old judges.

1000
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
So based on this,

1001
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,840
for an actor with very little experience like Jianxi,

1002
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
it will be a loss.

1003
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
The three movies are

1004
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Relaxing Love,

1005
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
Psychological Suspicion,

1006
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
and Sadness.

1007
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
For the appeal of the ticket office,

1008
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Jianxi is definitely not good at emotional affection.

1009
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,840
For the depth of human nature,

1010
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,840
the soul is not good at beauty.

1011
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,840
So it was already at the bottom.

1012
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
If we want to win,

1013
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
we have to think of another way.

1014
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
What is the way?

1015
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Playing the card of love,

1016
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
rely on the mouth.

1017
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
Mouth?

1018
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,840
Soul this movie

1019
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
may not be the best movie in this year's ticket office.

1020
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
But it must be the best comment,

1021
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
the most tiring,

1022
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
the most rational movie.

1023
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
From now on,

1024
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
we will use the network platform

1025
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
and professional critics to create a market.

1026
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
When the movie is officially released,

1027
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
the movie will be released.

1028
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
Bastard.

1029
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,840
What's so great about it?

1030
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,840
How can you say I'm self-righteous?

1031
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Damn it.

1032
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
Damn it.

1033
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
This annoying bastard.

1034
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Jianxi,

1035
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
what are you doing?

1036
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
What are you doing?

1037
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,840
Why are you so lazy?

1038
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
If you are so absent-minded,

1039
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
get out of here.

1040
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Teacher.

1041
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
Jianxi,

1042
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
in order to play Changfei,

1043
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
how hard did you suffer?

1044
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
You almost got frozen to death.

1045
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
Do you remember?

1046
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
You can go one step further.

1047
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
You can go one step further

1048
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,840
and you will reach the peak.

1049
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
Why are you so lazy?

1050
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Teacher,

1051
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
for you,

1052
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,840
acting is the best way to reach the peak of life.

1053
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,840
But for me,

1054
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
acting is acting.

1055
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
It can realize the ideal of life.

1056
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,840
It can make the audience gain something.

1057
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,840
That's all.

1058
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Whether it's a good room or not,

1059
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
whether it can win a prize,

1060
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
it doesn't matter.

1061
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,840
I have different ideas from you.

1062
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Thank you for worrying about me.

1063
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Stop.

1064
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
Jianxi.

1065
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,840
Jianxi,

1066
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,840
if you can't reach the peak,

1067
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
you can't be the best actress.

1068
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
Do you know that?

1069
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,840
I said I could only act.

1070
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
It's different.

1071
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,840
Who taught you such a stupid idea?

1072
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,840
Is acting for yourself?

1073
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Is filming for yourself?

1074
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Of course not.

1075
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
It's for all the audience.

1076
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:38,840
《The Legend of Xiao Hui》

1077
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,840
哭一场来不及的幻想

1078
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,840
烟雨在落花上咳下了伤

1079
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Tonight the moonlight shines a little bit

1080
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,840
With loneliness and my carefree loyalty

1081
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Look at the prosperity and the silence, look at the loneliness and the sadness

1082
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,840
Look at the tide, the people, the cold, the dark, the bright

1083
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Too much hope, in the end you become desperate

1084
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:34,840
Look at you, I'm so blind, I'm so crazy, I'm so nervous

1085
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Too stubborn, I have to be young

1086
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,840
It's absurd, I don't forget the fire

1087
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,840
Looking back, there will be regrets

1088
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,840
You and I, we are gradually lost on the road

1089
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,840
The typhoon is crazy, don't think about anything

1090
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,840
Where is the new yellow sea?

1091
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:16,840
I'm just waiting for a person to arrive at dawn

1092
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:22,840
I'm just waiting for a person to arrive at dusk

1093
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:29,840
I'm just waiting for a person to arrive at dusk
