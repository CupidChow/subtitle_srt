1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far away

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, the second year

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,240
Transformed into magical eyes

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,880
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
Put on the most ancient gold armor

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
The weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,800
Use all your strength to fight for the most real you

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,440
No matter what the little trick is

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,160
No matter what rumors are

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,840
I will definitely do it

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,080
The world is invincible

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,400
I don't want you to be willing

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,980
Where is the gold

23
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,400
The sweet

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,720
Where is your heart

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,040
My heart is here

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,160
Even if the world is invincible

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,760
Only you

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Episode 2

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Look at this

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
I remember I put it here last time

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Maybe you remembered it wrong

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Really not

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Impossible, let me find it

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
I

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I said

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Really not

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
That

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I remember

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I have a hair clip at home to use

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
I want to go back

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Tang Fei

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
The corridor is bright

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
UPS equipment

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Just in case

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Really?

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Go, or it's too late

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
After the party

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
You remember to go home

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Of course I go home, I need you to tell me

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
You are a pig, I'm afraid you will forget

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
What do I forget

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Will you talk to me nicely and die

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Will die

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Pretending to be gentle and gentle in front of others

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
In my place, I'm hungry and careful

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Have you finished your nonsense

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Remember what I said, go quickly

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Got it

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,400
kite

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,440
Design

61
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
Design

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Your eyes

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Design

64
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,420
Your eyes

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,420
Get up

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,440
Yup

67
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,620
Ms

68
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,220
Water

69
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,180
Miss Wo

70
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,180
It's your turn, please go first

71
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,460
I am injured today

72
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,920
Rest here a while

73
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Wait a minute

74
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,220
You go first

75
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,600
Hey, my makeup has beenaji

76
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Give the mirror to me

77
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Are you pretending to be a flower or trying to use that trick again?

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,600
You have to tell me the truth. Which trick did I use?

79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
What trick can you use?

80
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
You just want to press the axis.

81
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
You're going crazy.

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Huo Jing.

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
You're getting more and more out of line.

84
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
At least I'm your senior. Why are you so straightforward?

85
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Senior? Senior...

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
You're supposed to die on the beach.

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I heard you're going to be a drug dealer this year.

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm better than someone.

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I advise you to show off if you have a chest.

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't be stubborn if you don't have a chest.

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Do you think you can get the first place?

92
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
But I admire your spirit of being disabled.

93
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
What's wrong with them?

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
They're trying to get the red carpet.

95
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
If you keep going, you'll get the crotch.

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Go on.

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Everyone has been waiting outside for more than half an hour.

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Please hurry up.

99
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Let her go first.

100
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Why? Your feet are really broken.

101
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
How can you talk?

102
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
I can talk whatever I want.

103
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Let me do it.

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I'll go first.

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I think it's a bit cold in this air conditioner room.

106
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
What's wrong with her?

107
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Our lines are so good.

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
It's okay.

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Just take it as a break from the meeting.

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
She's so stupid.

111
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
The director arranged her lines.

112
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
It's more beneficial for her.

113
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
She's wasted.

114
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I think she's great.

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Great.

116
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Let me see your makeup.

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Okay.

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Let me go with you.

119
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
You're going to play the piano?

120
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,600
The air here is too polluted.

121
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Let me go.

122
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Let me go.

123
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Let me go.

124
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Let me go.

125
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Let me go.

126
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Let me go.

127
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Let me go.

128
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Let me go.

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Let me go.

130
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Let me go.

131
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Let me go.

132
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Let me go.

133
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Let me go.

134
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Let me go.

135
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Let me go.

136
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Let me go.

137
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Let me go.

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Let me go.

139
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Let me go.

140
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Let me go.

141
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Let me go.

142
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Let me go.

143
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Let me go.

144
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Let me go.

145
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Let me go.

146
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Let me go.

147
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Let me go.

148
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Let me go.

149
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Let me go.

150
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Let me go.

151
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Let me go.

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
Let me go.

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Let me go.

154
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Let me go.

155
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Let me go.

156
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Let me go.

157
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Let me go.

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Let me go.

159
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Let me go.

160
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Let me go.

161
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Let me go.

162
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Let me go.

163
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Let me go.

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Let me go.

165
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Let me go.

166
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Let me go.

167
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Let me go.

168
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Let me go.

169
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Let me go.

170
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Let me go.

171
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Let me go.

172
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Let me go.

173
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Let me go.

174
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Let me go.

175
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Let me go.

176
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Let me go.

177
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Let me go.

178
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Let me go.

179
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I won't admit defeat.

180
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Not only am I the best female lead,

181
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,600
even Tang Fei will eventually be mine.

182
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I don't need you to give in.

183
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I will fight for it myself.

184
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Respected guests,

185
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,600
it's time for our most exciting moment tonight.

186
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
We will choose the best female lead.

187
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Next, let's move the spotlight to the big screen.

188
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Let's review the selected works of this season.

189
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
The sad life of Ni Hong,

190
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,600
the life of a beautiful person.

191
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Dream of Love.

192
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,600
A girl who is persistent in pursuing love

193
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,600
who writes a romantic love story.

194
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,600
A beautiful person who is brave to dig into the depth of humanity

195
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
and has a controversial theme

196
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
that will shock people's psychological suspense.

197
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Where is Zuo Zuo?

198
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Zuo Zuo had a fight with Mu Ge this afternoon.

199
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
He ran away.

200
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
I have called his assistant.

201
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
He will pick him up later.

202
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I can't control this child.

203
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Mu Ge is very obedient.

204
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
He still wants to go to America.

205
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
I am really pissed off by them.

206
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Enough.

207
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
The children have grown up.

208
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Let them make their own choices.

209
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Fortunately, you are with me.

210
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600
My soul, 21st century.

211
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,600
It tells the story of a girl who is fighting against the disease.

212
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,600
It can be said that this movie is the best of this year's

213
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Okay, after introducing all our works,

214
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
then next,

215
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
we are also very shocked to get this news.

216
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
According to the decision of the movie committee,

217
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
the participation of each person in the movie is cancelled.

218
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
What's going on?

219
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I don't know.

220
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I just saw Zuo Zuo.

221
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Didn't he come?

222
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Didn't come.

223
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't worry about others.

224
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Don't worry about others.

225
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Take care of yourself.

226
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Actually, sometimes,

227
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
movies are like life.

228
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
We don't know what will happen next.

229
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Okay, let's get back to the point.

230
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Who is the best female lead?

231
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Let's take a look.

232
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,600
This time, the best female lead of Phoenix Film Festival is...

233
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Please let me win.

234
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Please let me win.

235
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Jian Xi.

236
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
The love of the next door.

237
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Let's congratulate Miss Ji Qing.

238
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Let's welcome Miss Ji Qing to receive the award.

239
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Let's welcome the guest Tang Fei to give the award to Miss Ji Qing.

240
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Don't be discouraged.

241
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Yes, don't let others see it.

242
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Hurry up.

243
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Congratulations.

244
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Congratulations.

245
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Thank you.

246
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Where is she?

247
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
She disappeared when I came out.

248
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I'll go back to find her.

249
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
No.

250
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
What's wrong?

251
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
She left like that.

252
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
The reporters will definitely make a rumor.

253
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
You have to stay and help her deal with it.

254
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
What about her?

255
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Don't worry.

256
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Leave it to me.

257
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Mr. Zhan, long time no see.

258
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Lu Zhou, why are you here?

259
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I want to ask you something.

260
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Why did you come here?

261
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I came to see you.

262
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I want to ask you something.

263
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Why did you come here?

264
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Why did you come here?

265
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I want to ask you something.

266
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
The best female lead of Phoenix Film Festival

267
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
used to be the most artistic

268
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
and the best actress.

269
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Why is it this year?

270
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
This is obviously for the film.

271
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Why did you move to Ji Qing?

272
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Where is your justice?

273
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Mr. Lu.

274
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Miss Ji Qing, congratulations.

275
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Thank you.

276
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
By the way, where is Jian Xi?

277
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Why didn't I see her?

278
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,600
She is someone who doesn't know how to hide her emotions.

279
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
She didn't get such an important award.

280
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Why didn't you give it to her?

281
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm sorry.

282
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
I'm sorry.

283
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm sorry.

284
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm sorry.

285
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
I'm sorry.

286
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm sorry.

287
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I'm sorry.

288
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm sorry.

289
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
I'm sorry.

290
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
You didn't get the award.

291
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I guess you're looking for a place to cry.

292
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Actually, she's really great.

293
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I'm just a show-off.

294
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Do you really think

295
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,600
this award is so easy to get?

296
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
What do you mean?

297
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Do you want to hear

298
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
how Zhan Pingliang evaluated it?

299
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Of all the films this year,

300
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
the most artistic

301
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
and the best-selling film

302
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
belongs to Jian Xi.

303
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
But I won this award.

304
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
The judges must have approved of me.

305
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
You should thank Qi Wensen.

306
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
If you didn't get his help,

307
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
would you have won so easily?

308
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Impossible.

309
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
This is impossible.

310
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
It's going to rain.

311
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Miss Ji Qing,

312
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
go find a place to shelter from the rain.

313
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I should go back too.

314
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
What you said is not true.

315
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
I got the award through my strength.

316
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
What a pity.

317
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
The best female lead.

318
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
The best female lead.

319
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
You're just not meant to be.

320
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Ji Qing.

321
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Ji Qing.

322
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Ji Qing.

323
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Ji Qing.

324
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
What are you doing here alone?

325
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Get in the car.

326
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I'll take you home.

327
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
What have you done?

328
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Did you use a despicable means

329
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
to make me the best female lead?

330
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
What are you talking about?

331
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Go home with me.

332
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Let me go.

333
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Don't listen to those rumors.

334
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
You can get this award

335
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
with a clear conscience.

336
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Make it clear.

337
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
You don't have to care about

338
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
a female lead like Jian Xi.

339
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
She's just a joke.

340
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
So what she said is true.

341
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
You're lying to me.

342
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
You've been lying to me.

343
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Let's talk when we get home.

344
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Okay?

345
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Get in the car.

346
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Go away.

347
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
For this play,

348
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I've been eating,

349
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
and gaining weight.

350
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Now I want to throw up when I see the chocolate.

351
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
I know everything.

352
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
I've seen everything you've done.

353
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
And now I've got my revenge.

354
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Yes.

355
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
You've got your revenge.

356
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I thought today

357
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
was the most important moment for me.

358
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I thought I deserved all this.

359
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
But it's not.

360
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
You made my efforts

361
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
a joke.

362
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
You made me a villain.

363
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
You made me

364
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
a villain.

365
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
I'll never be a villain.

366
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Ji Qing.

367
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
I've always wanted

368
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
the most beautiful woman.

369
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
But this award

370
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
doesn't belong to me.

371
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Ji Qing.

372
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Ji Qing.

373
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
How could this happen?

374
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Ji Qing.

375
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Ji Qing.

376
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Why are you crying?

377
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
You're so stupid.

378
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
The more you can't get the award,

379
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
the more you should

380
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
congratulate your opponent.

381
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Mingyu is sad.

382
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Why should I congratulate her?

383
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
I don't want to do

384
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
those things on WeChat.

385
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
You ran away like an idiot.

386
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
What will others think?

387
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
What will the reporters write tomorrow?

388
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
They will think that

389
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
you can't get the award.

390
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
So they are angry

391
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
and say that you're not good-looking.

392
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm not good-looking.

393
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Stop wiping.

394
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Look at yourself.

395
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
What if the reporters

396
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
take photos of you?

397
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
They can take photos.

398
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Actors are human.

399
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Can't actors cry

400
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
when they're sad?

401
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Look.

402
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Look at my hand.

403
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
And here.

404
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
It's all wounds.

405
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
In the movie,

406
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
every shot is handsome.

407
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
I did my best.

408
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
But I still lost.

409
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
I lost so easily

410
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
without any progress.

411
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Why can't I

412
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
get the reward?

413
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Why can't I do my best?

414
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
What do you mean by best?

415
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Best is the only thing.

416
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
If I win the award in the movie festival,

417
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
it can prove my ability.

418
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Then I'll tell you.

419
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
There's nothing good or bad.

420
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
What can a movie festival prove?

421
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
The movie festival can judge.

422
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Otherwise,

423
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
what can it do?

424
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Since not everyone can win the award,

425
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
why do they lie to us?

426
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Look at me.

427
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
I dressed up so well.

428
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I went to the cold water.

429
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
I got the flowers on my head.

430
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
What's going on?

431
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Help.

432
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Hello, sir.

433
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
This is the center of the house.

434
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Do you need help?

435
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
We're trapped in the elevator.

436
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Send someone to save us.

437
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Okay.

438
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Help.

439
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
We'll send someone to repair it.

440
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Wait a minute.

441
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Is there anyone?

442
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Are you scared?

443
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Of course.

444
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Of course.

445
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
People will die.

446
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Didn't you cry just now?

447
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Don't you want to be sad now?

448
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
I...

449
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Movie festival?

450
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
You win today, he wins tomorrow.

451
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Falling is not scary.

452
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
The important thing is you can still climb up.

453
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
What's going on?

454
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Will we die?

455
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
It's okay.

456
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
It's okay.

457
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Will we die?

458
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
We're trapped in the elevator.

459
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Can you care about the accident?

460
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Be a little anxious.

461
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
It's okay.

462
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Relax.

463
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Relax.

464
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Don't be so nervous.

465
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
I tell you.

466
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Remember.

467
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
You are a female actor.

468
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
You are a female star.

469
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Always keep your attitude.

470
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Smile.

471
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,600
No matter when, no matter where.

472
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Use the most perfect smile.

473
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Show it to everyone.

474
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Smile.

475
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Don't cry.

476
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Don't cry.

477
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
It's okay.

478
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Don't worry.

479
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm scared.

480
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm scared.

481
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Don't lie to me.

482
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Are you okay?

483
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Sorry to scare you.

484
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Mr. T.

485
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
You are Mr. T.

486
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Now I realize it's not too late.

487
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I'm sorry.

488
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
I'm sorry.

489
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
I'm sorry.

490
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
I'm sorry.

491
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I'm sorry.

492
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I'm sorry.

493
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I'm sorry.

494
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I'm sorry.

495
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I'm sorry.

496
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm sorry.

497
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
It's not too late.

498
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I...

499
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I thought...

500
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Listen.

501
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
In my heart,

502
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
you are the best actress.

503
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
You are the best female lead tonight.

504
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,600
I wanted to celebrate with you tonight.

505
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
So I bought a lot of roses.

506
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I put them upstairs in advance.

507
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Who knows I almost got caught by you.

508
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I almost died.

509
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

510
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Because you always think I'm your enemy.

511
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Even if I told you first,

512
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,600
you would think I'm a coward.

513
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
I bought it for you.

514
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
This...

515
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
This is the best actress I have ever seen.

516
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
You can only accept it.

517
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
You can't refuse.

518
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Turn around.

519
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
It's the first time I've seen you so gentle.

520
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
I've always been gentle.

521
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
But you can't see it.

522
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
I...

523
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
What's wrong?

524
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
It hurts!

525
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
It's okay.

526
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Do you remember what I said?

527
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
You said a lot of things.

528
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
How can I know which ones?

529
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
I just said it.

530
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
No matter what,

531
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
in my heart,

532
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
I'm the heroine of this family.

533
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
I declare that

534
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
from now on,

535
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
I'm officially with you.

536
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Wait.

537
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
What?

538
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
You didn't even tell me you liked me.

539
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
How can it be so easy?

540
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
This isn't a confession.

541
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
What do you want?

542
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
You haven't even said you liked me.

543
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I...

544
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Let me ask you.

545
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Do you like me?

546
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
You tell me first.

547
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
You tell me first.

548
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
You tell me first.

549
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
You tell me first.

550
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
You tell me first.

551
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
I love you.

552
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
I love you.

553
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
From the beginning,

554
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
when you hated me so much,

555
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
I already fell in love with you.

556
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Then,

557
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
why didn't I know it before?

558
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Of course you didn't know.

559
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Tell me what you know.

560
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
I...

561
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm very fair.

562
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
I already told you I love you.

563
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Now it's your turn.

564
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Promise me.

565
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Be my girlfriend, okay?

566
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
I won't promise you for now.

567
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
I already told you.

568
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Now,

569
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
it's really not easy to find a boyfriend like me.

570
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
You have to cherish it.

571
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Tang Fei.

572
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Why are you still the same?

573
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
What do you mean?

574
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
You think you're willful.

575
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Can't you give me some time to think?

576
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Just be together.

577
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Okay.

578
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
I'll give you time to think.

579
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Three seconds.

580
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Three.

581
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Two.

582
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
One.

583
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Hurry up.

584
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
I have an announcement tomorrow.

585
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Hurry up.

586
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I have an announcement tomorrow.

587
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
I have to rest early.

588
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Hurry up.

589
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
No, it's so urgent.

590
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Hurry up.

591
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
No, I...

592
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Let me tell you.

593
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
I'll give you one night.

594
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
I'll wait for your answer tomorrow morning.

595
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
I'll wait for your answer tomorrow morning.

596
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
You...

597
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
I'm sorry, sir.

598
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I made you wait for so long.

599
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
We can board in half an hour.

600
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
You guys.

601
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
There should be a limit to being late.

602
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
How many hours have passed?

603
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Do you know what I'm doing?

604
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
You're wasting my time.

605
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Do you know how much money I've wasted?

606
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
I'm sorry, sir.

607
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
The weather in the US is bad.

608
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
So the plane is late.

609
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
But we will follow the rules of the airport.

610
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
And give you a free ticket.

611
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Don't be angry, okay?

612
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Okay.

613
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Since you said so, then forget it.

614
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
How long do I have to wait for boarding?

615
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
You can board in 20 minutes.

616
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Okay.

617
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Hello, Mu.

618
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Uncle.

619
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Something happened to Zuo Zuo.

620
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
What?

621
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Don't worry.

622
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Everything will be fine.

623
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
What's wrong?

624
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Are you cold?

625
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
I'm fine.

626
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I'm just worried.

627
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
I'm just worried.

628
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
My mom is seriously ill.

629
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Now my dad is in trouble again.

630
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
I really don't know what to do.

631
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I really don't know what to do.

632
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
It's okay.

633
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I will be with you.

634
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Wait for my uncle to wake up.

635
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
A man you don't want to see is here.

636
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
I'm sorry to bother you at this time.

637
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I'm here to apologize for Zuo Zuo.

638
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
He's the one who always causes trouble.

639
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
But it's someone else who apologizes.

640
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
It's because of your humiliation.

641
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
He will make a difference.

642
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Miss Shen.

643
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
We will pay for uncle's medical bills.

644
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
No matter how much compensation you make.

645
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
We will definitely make it.

646
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Just give Zuo Zuo another chance.

647
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Don't spread this out.

648
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
So many people have seen it.

649
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
The judges also canceled the awards because of his evil behavior.

650
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Do you think you can hide it?

651
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Miss Shen.

652
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm begging you.

653
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Don't ruin Zuo Zuo's future.

654
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
We will definitely give you a satisfactory answer.

655
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Satisfactory answer.

656
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Is your answer worth money?

657
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Take your money and leave.

658
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Miss Shen.

659
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Go.

660
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
I don't want to see any of you leave.

661
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Miss Shen.

662
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Give Zuo Zuo another chance.

663
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Miss Shen.

664
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Miss Shen.

665
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Get out.

666
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Dad.

667
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
It will all pass.

668
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I will always be with you.

669
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
You still don't want to leave?

670
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
I'm sorry, sir.

671
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Please come and pay the hospital bills.

672
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
I'm sorry.

673
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
I'll go first.

674
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Dad.

675
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
I'm really sorry.

676
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
I'm not.

677
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
I didn't mean to.

678
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
I really didn't mean to.

679
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Dad.

680
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Zuo Zuo.

681
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Go up and soak in hot water first.

682
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Stop.

683
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
The child just finished the pen.

684
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Can't you let him rest for a while?

685
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Then why don't you ask him?

686
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
What did he do wrong?

687
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Then I want to ask you.

688
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
What did I do?

689
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
What did I do wrong?

690
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
You pushed him down the building.

691
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
You were disqualified by the judge.

692
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Everyone knows that.

693
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
You still have the nerve to ask me what you did wrong?

694
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
I didn't.

695
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
I was wronged by him.

696
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Then you mean

697
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
He pushed his father down the building

698
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
and wronged you, right?

699
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Yes.

700
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
He pushed him down the building.

701
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
It's true.

702
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I can't help but laugh.

703
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
You can make up such a strange story.

704
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Is there anything more strange?

705
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
You are hopeless.

706
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Brother Wu, you're back.

707
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Have you done your job?

708
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
I just went to the hospital.

709
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Mr. Shen is still unconscious.

710
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Shen Yan also refused to take our compensation.

711
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Compensation?

712
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Why do we have to give him compensation?

713
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
The situation has already reached this point.

714
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
We can only make small things small.

715
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
We can't make it full of wind and rain.

716
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,600
But I didn't push him down the building.

717
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Why should I give him compensation?

718
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Shut up.

719
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
You have nothing to say here.

720
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
So

721
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,600
None of you believe me, right?

722
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Yes.

723
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Only you can do this.

724
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
What did I do wrong in my previous life?

725
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
My daughter has become so lawless.

726
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Brother Wu

727
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
It's not me who pushed him down the building.

728
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
It's Shen Yan who pushed his father down the building.

729
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
It really has nothing to do with me.

730
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Please believe me.

731
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Okay?

732
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Zuo Zuo

733
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
We must reduce the risk of this matter to the lowest.

734
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Today is the film festival.

735
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
So the reporters didn't go.

736
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
But tomorrow?

737
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Everyone will be sealed in the hospital.

738
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
We have to think of a plan before that.

739
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
You don't believe me.

740
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Why are you here?

741
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Zuo Zuo, calm down.

742
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
You all would rather believe the outsiders

743
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
than believe me, right?

744
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Okay.

745
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
From today on

746
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
I don't need anyone of you to believe me.

747
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Zuo Zuo

748
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
And

749
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Zuo Zuo

750
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
You can stop here.

751
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,600
From now on, I will solve my own problems.

752
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
You don't need to care about it.

753
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
What are you doing?

754
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Why are you in a hurry?

755
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
I will think of a way.

756
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
What other way can you think of?

757
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
There will always be a way.

758
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Dad, don't worry about me.

759
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
You don't need to come back to accompany me.

760
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
I

761
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
want to be alone.

762
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
I want to be alone.

763
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Xiao Qing

764
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Don't be so willful.

765
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,600
The best female lead is of course you.

766
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Why do you blame Wen Sen?

767
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Xiao Qing

768
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Hello

769
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Can you hear me?

770
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Xiao Qing

771
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Xiao Qing

772
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Xiao Qing

773
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Xiao Qing

774
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Are you listening to me?

775
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Xiao Qing

776
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Xiao Qing

777
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Xiao...

778
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
It's early in the morning. What are you doing?

779
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I am going to the beach to shoot an advertisement today.

780
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
So I have to clean up in advance.

781
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Isn't there an hour left?

782
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Why are you in a hurry?

783
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
You don't understand.

784
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
You are really weird.

785
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
You are weird.

786
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,600
I thought you didn't get the award last night.

787
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
You must be in a bad mood.

788
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
I didn't expect it to look like nothing happened.

789
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
The year is over.

790
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
We will fight again tomorrow.

791
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
There is not only one movie festival.

792
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
You want to watch it so much?

793
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
You want to watch the dance?

794
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Hurry up and help me clean up.

795
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Wait a minute. You go there yourself.

796
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I have to go and deal with some documents later.

797
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
You are not going with me?

798
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
I will come over to see you in the afternoon.

799
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Then you come earlier. I will miss you.

800
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Why are you here?

801
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
I think I want to shoot the same advertisement with you.

802
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Impossible. I have never heard of it.

803
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I only knew it 20 minutes ago.

804
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
20 minutes ago?

805
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
When you went out.

806
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Anxin.

807
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Anxin.

808
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
Anxin.

809
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Anxin.

810
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Anxin.

811
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Anxin.

812
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Anxin.

813
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Anxin.

814
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Anxin.

815
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Master, stop the car.

816
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Keep driving.

817
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Stop the car.

818
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
Are you trying to hide from me?

819
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
I...

820
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Shoot the advertisement.

821
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
When the advertisement is done.

822
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
I will ask you for the answer.

823
00:34:46,600 --> 00:35:05,480
The

824
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Tang Fei, look.

825
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
The sea is so fun.

826
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Look.

827
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
I paid for your leave for a day.

828
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
So you can play as you like.

829
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Really?

830
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Are you happy?

831
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
You can really play?

832
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
That's great!

833
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Come on!

834
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
That's so fun!

835
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Let's go!

836
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Do you want to play a game?

837
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
What do you mean?

838
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Come on!

839
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Where are you taking me?

840
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Be careful!

841
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Come on!

842
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Come on!

843
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Is it fun?

844
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
It's great!

845
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Come on!

846
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
It's fun!

847
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Come on!

848
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Come on!

849
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Stop!

850
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Don't run!

851
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Bring her here!

852
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Huang Qiqiang!

853
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
What are you doing?

854
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Let me down!

855
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Help!

856
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
I'm not crazy!

857
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Let me down!

858
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Let me down!

859
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Who is your girlfriend?

860
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
That's great!

861
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
If someone finds out,

862
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
I'll take a picture of her.

863
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Let me down!

864
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Will you be my girlfriend?

865
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I promise!

866
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
I promise!

867
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
That's more like it.

868
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Sorry!

869
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
It's too late!

870
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
This is punishment!

871
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Come back!

872
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
What are you doing?

873
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
What are you doing?

874
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
What are you doing?

875
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Qi Qing!

876
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
What's wrong with Qi Qing?

877
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Say something!

878
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Qi Qing!

879
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
Qi Qing was taken away!

880
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Who took her away?

881
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Calm down first.

882
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Tell me the truth.

883
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Okay?

884
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Okay?

885
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Let's play next time, okay?

886
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Tang Fei!

887
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Qi Mingzi!

888
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Get out of the way!

889
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Do you know that it's all because of you that Qi Qing is in danger?

890
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
What's wrong with Qi Qing?

891
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Qi Qing is in trouble.

892
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
What happened to her?

893
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Come with me.

894
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Let's go!

895
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,220
The

896
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Hey, the phone!

897
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Jiahua!

898
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Let Tang Fei answer the phone.

899
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Let me ask you.

900
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Where is Qi Qing now?

901
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
I want to talk to Tang Fei.

902
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Answer the phone.

903
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Hello?

904
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
I'm Tang Fei.

905
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
Tang Fei.

906
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,600
I really like you.

907
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
From the moment you debuted,

908
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
I would listen to every concert you had.

909
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,600
I would buy all your records.

910
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
I just want to tell you.

911
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,600
I'm your most most most most most most most loyal fan.

912
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Okay, I don't care who you are.

913
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Please don't hurt Qi Qing.

914
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Do you remember?

915
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
There was a concert.

916
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
I was very close to you.

917
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
I even kissed you.

918
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Thank you for your support.

919
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Thank you.

920
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
I hope everyone...

921
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Tang Fei, I'm so sorry.

922
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Hurry and drag her down.

923
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
I love you.

924
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Tang Fei, I love you.

925
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Tang Fei.

926
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Tang Fei, are you okay?

927
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
I remember you.

928
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
You remember now, right?

929
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Let me talk to Ji Qing, okay?

930
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
She's very nice.

931
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm asking you to let me talk to Ji Qing.

932
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
I really like you.

933
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
You're the most handsome actor in the world.

934
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
I'll say it again.

935
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Please let me talk to Ji Qing, okay?

936
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
No.

937
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Unless you're willing to see me.

938
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Okay, I can see you.

939
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Really?

940
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
But I have one condition.

941
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
You have to ensure Ji Qing's safety.

942
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Because this has nothing to do with her.

943
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
I will send the address to the public email you left to the fans.

944
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
In the mail box, in an hour...

945
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
I must see you in an hour.

946
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
I'm warning you.

947
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
You can't hurt Ji Qing.

948
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Otherwise, I will never let you go.

949
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Do you hear me?

950
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
This...

951
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
What should I do?

952
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Mr. Ji, don't worry.

953
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
He already said that

954
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,600
he will send his address to my mailbox in a while.

955
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
We will inform the police.

956
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
We will definitely punish him.

957
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
No.

958
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
If we are told by the other party,

959
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
Ji Qing will be in danger.

960
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Because we don't know if this person is lying to us.

961
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Only telling the police is the biggest help to Ji Qing.

962
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
You don't have Ji Qing in your heart.

963
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
If it weren't for you,

964
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
would she be kidnapped by others?

965
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Qi Wen Sen.

966
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
It's all because of you.

967
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Enough, enough.

968
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
You two don't fight.

969
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
I...

970
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
I support Qi Wen Sen's words.

971
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Don't tell the police for now.

972
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,600
I don't want to tease them.

973
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
I don't want to take advantage of this.

974
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Please, Tang Fei.

975
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
The address has been sent.

976
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Mr. Ji.

977
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Mr. Ji.

978
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
The medicine.

979
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Where is the medicine?

980
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
The medicine is in my pocket.

981
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
Here.

982
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Mr. Ji.

983
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Where are they?

984
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Mr. Ji, don't worry.

985
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
We won't call the police.

986
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I promise you.

987
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
I will bring Ji Qing back as soon as possible.

988
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Okay.

989
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Thank you.

990
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Thank you.

991
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Xiaoxiao.

992
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
I'm sorry.

993
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Thank you.

994
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
Xiaoxiao, take care of Mr. Ji.

995
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
We'll be right back.

996
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Mr. Ji.

997
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Mr. Ji.

998
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
I...

999
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,600
Ji Qing.

1000
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
I think Mr. Ji is very handsome.

1001
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
He is cool.

1002
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,600
He is a domineering president.

1003
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
I think he is a good match for you.

1004
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,600
Don't joke.

1005
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,600
I'm not joking.

1006
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
Mr. Ji is so cold to others.

1007
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
He only cares about you.

1008
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
He only cares about you.

1009
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
He only cares about you.

1010
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,600
He only cares about you.

1011
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,600
He only cares about you.

1012
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
He is so cold to others.

1013
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
He only cares about you.

1014
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,600
You really don't have feelings for him?

1015
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:58,600
The rain falls on the flowers.

1016
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,600
The moonlight shines on me.

1017
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,600
I will sing with loneliness.

1018
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
I watch the flowers bloom.

1019
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,600
I watch loneliness disappear.

1020
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,600
I watch the tide rise and fall.

1021
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,600
The cold and the cold.

1022
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,600
There are so many expectations.

1023
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,600
I become desperate at the end.

1024
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
I watch you come and go.

1025
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
I hold on to the wind and frost.

1026
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,600
Everything is in a trance.

1027
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
I am still stubborn.

1028
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,600
I am still young and crazy.

1029
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:47,600
I don't forget the fire with the light.

1030
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,600
I look back and think of the past.

1031
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,600
You and I are getting lost on the road.

1032
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:05,600
I don't care about the typhoon.

1033
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Where should I hide my red heart?

1034
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:17,600
I am waiting for the dawn alone.

1035
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,600
I am waiting for the daybreak alone.

1036
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:30,600
I am waiting for the daybreak alone.
