1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far or far away

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, in the second year

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will be a magical eye

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,760
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
The weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Use all your strength to fight against the most real you

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
No matter what the little tricks

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what rumors

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,000
I will definitely be invincible

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't want you to be willing

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,320
In the past, I kept the sweet

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
My heart is here

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,080
Even if the iron armor is invincible

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,880
I'm only a you

I want to talk to Jin Xu

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,020
Sorry, we are about to ask everyone that

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,840
and our

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,920
work pressure decision has just been standardiked

34
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,620
there is no reality

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,620
this is just aneby

36
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,500
It is asked easily

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,300
to talk the interlocutor

38
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,920
isn't this why we need to gauge brain over thought?

39
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,820

Don't go, ok?

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,020
I will use every possible way to protect myself.

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,020
Now, I can tell you for sure

44
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,020
that she is actually a very gentle person.

45
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,020
The Tang Fei you know is completely different from the one I know.

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,020
As expected, you know her better than I do.

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,020
Ji Qing, you are a very excellent girl.

48
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,020
If you finally get together with Tang Fei,

49
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,020
I will still congratulate you.

50
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,020
Nonsense. You love her so much.

51
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,020
How can you give her to me?

52
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Stop lying.

53
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Yes, I am not willing to give her to you.

54
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,020
But you are my most respected opponent.

55
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
I am willing to bet on it.

56
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Okay, I am leaving.

57
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Where are you going?

58
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
I have already contacted the American hospital.

59
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,020
I need to be treated further.

60
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
I will not be back for a few years.

61
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
What about the company?

62
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
What about the rose life?

63
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,020
The company's contract, the teacher said that it would help me solve it.

64
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
As for the rose life,

65
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
the contract has already been reached.

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,020
Ji Qing, I will leave now.

67
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
I will go back to the hospital.

68
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
I have already reached the agreement.

69
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,020
Ji Qing, I am very happy to know you as my opponent.

70
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,020
I hope we can meet again in the future.

71
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,020
Goodbye.

72
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Don't go.

73
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,020
You are my only opponent.

74
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,020
If you leave,

75
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,020
and leave me alone,

76
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
what is the point of winning?

77
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
Ji Qing,

78
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,020
I have no more strength to compete with you.

79
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,020
You won.

80
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,020
I'm going.

81
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Ji Qing,

82
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,020
you have won now.

83
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,020
Why are you still not happy?

84
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
I can not give up the competition.

85
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,020
I can not give up.

86
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,020
What are you doing?

87
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,020
I'm calling Tang Fei.

88
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,020
Tell him to stop the analysis.

89
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
I don't understand.

90
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,020
You are obviously jealous of the analysis.

91
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,020
Now I've cleared the obstacles.

92
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,020
You should be happy.

93
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,020
This year's best actress

94
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
must belong to you.

95
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,020
It's not like that.

96
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,020
That's right.

97
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,020
I admit that I'm jealous.

98
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,020
And I always hope

99
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,020
that there is no such person.

100
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,020
But I found that it's not like that.

101
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,020
It's not like that.

102
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Because she is my best opponent.

103
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,020
If it wasn't for her,

104
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
winning would have no meaning.

105
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,020
And she used such a despicable way

106
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
to force her to leave.

107
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
Then she would have admitted that I was afraid of her.

108
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,020
Before the competition started,

109
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
I had already lost.

110
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,020
I was crazy.

111
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
I don't know why I became like this.

112
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,020
So,

113
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
I have to make up for my fault now.

114
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,020
Hello, Tang Fei.

115
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,020
Hello.

116
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,020
Where are you?

117
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
What's up?

118
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,020
I'm asking where you are.

119
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,020
I'm meeting with Huan Yu.

120
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,020
Stay there.

121
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Don't go anywhere.

122
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
Hello.

123
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,020
Hello.

124
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,020
Tang Fei, let me tell you.

125
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,020
Jian Xi is leaving.

126
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
And she is giving up her life.

127
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,020
You must stop her.

128
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
Are you sure you want to leave?

129
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,020
No matter what I say,

130
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
you won't change your mind, right?

131
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Okay, get in the car.

132
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
Tang Fei.

133
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
Tang Fei.

134
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Remember to wear your seat belt.

135
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,020
Tang Fei, why did you bring me here?

136
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,020
Let go.

137
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
Tang Fei.

138
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,020
Xiao Nian,

139
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
why did you come out alone?

140
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Don't tell the nurse.

141
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,020
They won't let me get out of bed.

142
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,020
Be good.

143
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,020
Why are your eyes red?

144
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
Nothing.

145
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
This is for you.

146
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,020
Don't be sad.

147
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Go away.

148
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Xiao Nian, go back to your room.

149
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
Jian Xi.

150
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,020
Jian Xi.

151
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
Did you let me see this?

152
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
You saw Zuo Nian.

153
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Don't you have anything to say?

154
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,020
You brought me to see Zuo Nian.

155
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,020
You want to change my heart.

156
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,020
But I tell you,

157
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,020
I don't have that kind of thing.

158
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,020
A kiss is like saving money.

159
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
You never saved it.

160
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,020
How can you use it?

161
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
But Zuo Nian is not wrong.

162
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
All the mistakes were made by Zhan Mei, right?

163
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,020
I don't want to hear the name of this woman again.

164
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Jian Xi,

165
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
no matter how you deny it,

166
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
Zhan Mei is your mother.

167
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,020
You can't change this fact.

168
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,020
He never loved me.

169
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,020
He has been seeing me.

170
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
In my heart, I don't have a mother at all.

171
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,020
If you don't love, you won't have a mother.

172
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,020
No.

173
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,020
You want to get your mother's love.

174
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,020
You can't get it.

175
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
So you are so painful.

176
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,020
I hate him.

177
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,020
I will never forgive him.

178
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
This is the deepest pain in your heart.

179
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
So you choose to escape.

180
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,020
When do you plan to escape?

181
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,020
Now I'm with you.

182
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,020
Can you choose to face it with me?

183
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
I believe you will find that

184
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
forgiveness is not a difficult thing.

185
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
If forgiveness is easy,

186
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
why don't you forgive Mr. Han?

187
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,020
You can't do it at all.

188
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
Right?

189
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
Don't teach me what is forgiveness.

190
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,020
Because you can't do it yourself.

191
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
You scared me.

192
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,020
You are at home.

193
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,020
Why didn't you turn on the recording?

194
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
I just wanted to listen to your wenns.

195
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,020
I can explain to you.

196
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
Why could you sleep so late at night?

197
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
Don't listen to my envoy!

198
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:58,020
Soütwud Swiningら

199
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,020
He called?

200
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,020
Of course he called.

201
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,020
No, he didn't.

202
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,420
You two ShinTomon

203
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,340
Why didn't you turn on the light?

204
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,740
Are you okay?

205
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,460
Are you leaving?

206
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,060
Where are you going?

207
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,060
I have something to tell you.

208
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,660
iße

209
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
If the child is unable

210
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,280
to find a successful groom within a predetermined time

211
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,180
That child's survival potential

212
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,460
will soon be low

213
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,060
injury

214
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,860
hair-cut

215
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,860
I beg you, please go and beg Jansi, okay?

216
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Dad, it seems that Jansi won't be coming to the training.

217
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Let's not be self-pitying anymore.

218
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
Don't force her anymore.

219
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,860
Blame me if you want to be quick.

220
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,860
Since all of this is my fault,

221
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,860
then let me bear all of this myself.

222
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,860
From now on,

223
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,860
she has nothing to do with this matter.

224
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,860
Xiao Nian will be fine.

225
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
We can definitely find other matchmakers.

226
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,860
We can definitely do it.

227
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,860
The immune cells that were extracted

228
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,860
will be sent to the training room.

229
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
In a week,

230
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,860
they will be inserted into Zuo Nian's body four times.

231
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,860
Thank you, Doctor.

232
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,860
Miss Jian,

233
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,860
you clearly made a choice.

234
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Why do you still have to go against the name?

235
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,860
I don't want this matter to be a victory.

236
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
As long as it can help Zuo Nian.

237
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,860
Doctor,

238
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,860
I don't want to be a victim.

239
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,860
I don't want to be a victim.

240
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
Doctor,

241
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Jian Xi is not feeling well now.

242
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
She is feeling numb all over.

243
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,860
Is there any problem?

244
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
Don't worry about that.

245
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,860
Miss Jian's body is feeling numb

246
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,860
because of the injection.

247
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,860
Soon, the reaction after the injection will disappear.

248
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,860
She just needs to rest for a few days.

249
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
It won't affect her health too much.

250
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,860
Thank you.

251
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,860
Let's go.

252
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,860
Jian Xi.

253
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,860
You...

254
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Sorry.

255
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,860
What's wrong with you?

256
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,860
You ran away.

257
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,860
So you are Tang Fei.

258
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,860
You are really Tang Fei.

259
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,860
Tang Fei.

260
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,860
You are really good at acting.

261
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,860
I saw you in many dramas.

262
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,860
Come, come.

263
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,860
Let's take a picture together.

264
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,860
Tang Fei, Tang Fei.

265
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,860
Let's take a picture together.

266
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,860
Sorry.

267
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
Don't go.

268
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,860
Don't go, Tang Fei.

269
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,860
Let's take a picture together.

270
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,860
Mr. Zuo.

271
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
We just found a suitable matchmaker.

272
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,860
The matchmaking was successful.

273
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,860
We found the matchmaker.

274
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,860
Who is she?

275
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,860
She saw our news on TV.

276
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
So she came to try it.

277
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
We didn't expect that the matchmaking was successful.

278
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
Dr. Fei.

279
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Is this true?

280
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
Yes.

281
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
I'm sure she is the one who found the matchmaker.

282
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,860
She is the one who found the matchmaker.

283
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
Dr. Fei.

284
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
Is this true?

285
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,860
But the specific information

286
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,860
is confidential.

287
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Thank you, doctor.

288
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
Thank you, doctor.

289
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Xiaoyan is saved.

290
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
Xiaoyan is saved.

291
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Let's go to the front.

292
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
Let's go.

293
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
What's wrong?

294
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Nothing.

295
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
I'll go.

296
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,860
It must be Jinxi.

297
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Tang Fei.

298
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Jinxi is here to play the role.

299
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,860
She asked the doctor to keep it a secret.

300
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,860
She and Lu Zhou have gone to the airport.

301
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,860
You go and get her back.

302
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
Are you really leaving?

303
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
Anxin.

304
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,860
I will contact you often.

305
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,860
Thank you very much

306
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
for coming all the way here.

307
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,860
Thank you for always helping me.

308
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,860
But I did nothing wrong.

309
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,860
It's all your effort.

310
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
You deserve it.

311
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,860
After you get there,

312
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
take good care of yourself.

313
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
If you encounter anything unhappy,

314
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,860
you can call me anytime.

315
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,860
I'll be there for you.

316
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
Thank you.

317
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
Don't worry.

318
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Don't worry.

319
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
I don't want you to leave.

320
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,860
Take good care of yourself.

321
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Okay, Anxin.

322
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Don't worry.

323
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
I will contact you often.

324
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,860
Don't cry.

325
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
Jinxi, we're leaving.

326
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Jinxi.

327
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Jinxi.

328
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,860
I know you went to Peixing.

329
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,860
Why are you still leaving?

330
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,860
Come here.

331
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,860
Tang Fei.

332
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,860
Tang Fei.

333
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
Go back with me.

334
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
I'm done with her.

335
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
I went to Han Zhengde just now.

336
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,860
I forgave him.

337
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,860
I learned the rules

338
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
as you said.

339
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
You taught me that.

340
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
Tang Fei.

341
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Jinxi has decided to leave here.

342
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
You don't need

343
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
to bother her anymore.

344
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
You know

345
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
how much I hated him before.

346
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,860
I swear I will never forgive him.

347
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,860
But I found out later

348
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,860
that it wasn't like that.

349
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860
I was unhappy before.

350
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,860
Why?

351
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
Because I have a heavy burden

352
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,860
in my heart.

353
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
I don't want you to be like me.

354
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
Since I met you,

355
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
you taught me

356
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
not to be so selfish

357
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
and narrow-minded.

358
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
You taught me to be lenient

359
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,860
and to love.

360
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,860
Why can't you do it yourself?

361
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
If Zhan Mei

362
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
had abandoned you,

363
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
you wouldn't have today.

364
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
I can't see

365
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
a brave, persistent

366
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
and successful you today.

367
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,860
I should thank him

368
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,860
for what you said.

369
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,860
You may think it's ridiculous.

370
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
But that's the way the world is.

371
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
That's life.

372
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,860
I've arranged a lot of difficulties for you.

373
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
You have to face it.

374
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
You can't run away.

375
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,860
If you leave today,

376
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,860
you will never be happy.

377
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,860
Do you think I'll be happy

378
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,860
if I stay?

379
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,860
Jian Xi,

380
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,860
I really care about you.

381
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
You care about me?

382
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
Tang Fei,

383
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,860
since Jian Xi has decided to leave,

384
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
you should respect

385
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,860
her decision.

386
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
I will.

387
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
Of course I will respect

388
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
any decision she makes.

389
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
But I want to tell you,

390
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,860
people live not only for their dreams,

391
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,860
but also for their feelings and hearts.

392
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,860
I don't want to see

393
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
you live in

394
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,860
the memories of pain all your life.

395
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,860
Jian Xi, let's go.

396
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
Jian Xi!

397
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,860
Please!

398
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
I'm sorry.

399
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,860
Thank you for giving me

400
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
a few days to think it over.

401
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
As long as it's your request,

402
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
I will try to accept it.

403
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,860
I have a question.

404
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
What is it?

405
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
Qi Wen Sen is not the person

406
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
who planned it behind my back.

407
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,860
It's you, right?

408
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Why did you say such strange words?

409
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
If this was designed by Qi Wen Sen,

410
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,460
he wouldn't let me leave Beijing so easily.

411
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
Unless...

412
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,060
You have reached an agreement with him.

413
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
Or,

414
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,860
the relationship between me and Zhan Mei,

415
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,260
I went to the hospital to see Zuo Nian,

416
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,060
and the final love between me and Zhan Mei,

417
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,660
were all planned by you.

418
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,860
What's the point of me doing this?

419
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,260
This is unreasonable.

420
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Yes.

421
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,260
I also feel that it's unreasonable.

422
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,260
That's why I never doubted it.

423
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,260
Because you have always been helping me,

424
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,460
caring for me,

425
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,060
and giving me the biggest encouragement.

426
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,860
How could you be the one who planned everything behind my back?

427
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,860
Alright, Jian Xin.

428
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,460
Don't say such unwritten words.

429
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,860
I want to know the truth.

430
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,260
Alright.

431
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,460
Tell me the truth.

432
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,860
Jian Xin.

433
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,260
Everything I did was for your own good.

434
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,060
I've always been protecting you.

435
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,860
Because I don't want you to be hurt at all.

436
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,060
If you did it for my own good,

437
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,860
you wouldn't have lied to me on purpose.

438
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,860
Why did you do this?

439
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,660
I want you to have no regrets,

440
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,260
no pain,

441
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
and to pursue the movie with all your heart.

442
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,260
To become the best actress.

443
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
I don't understand.

444
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,060
I don't understand at all.

445
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,460
Let me tell you.

446
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,060
Tang Fei, Zhan Mei,

447
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,460
they will all distract you.

448
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,660
Once you get entangled with them,

449
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
you won't be able to act properly.

450
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,860
You will even forget your original dream.

451
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
Teacher.

452
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,260
I don't know you anymore.

453
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,860
Jian Xin.

454
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,060
I trained you myself.

455
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,260
You are my best work.

456
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,460
Because I want you to stand on the highest platform

457
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,260
on my behalf.

458
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,260
But now I've changed.

459
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Seeing them keep hurting you,

460
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,860
I really feel bad.

461
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,260
I want to help you clear all obstacles

462
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,060
and make you act without any regrets.

463
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,060
Clear obstacles?

464
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,260
One day you will understand.

465
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,660
In this world,

466
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,460
I'm the only one who loves you,

467
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
helps you, and achieves your dream.

468
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,460
Your love is too scary.

469
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,660
Teacher, what are you doing?

470
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,860
Where are you going?

471
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
Go back to the airport.

472
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
Leave immediately.

473
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,860
I don't want to go abroad.

474
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,860
Stop the car.

475
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,460
Jian Xin.

476
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,260
In this world,

477
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,660
I'm the one who loves you the most.

478
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,260
You don't understand love at all.

479
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,460
You made me lose my family and friends.

480
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,060
You made me become a lonely person.

481
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,060
Jian Xin.

482
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,660
As an actor,

483
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,060
acting is enough for you.

484
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,660
This is the way I love you.

485
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,860
But I need family and friends.

486
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,460
Even if you tie me up in America,

487
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,660
it's useless.

488
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Jian Xin.

489
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,460
After I lost my favorite actor,

490
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,860
you are the only one left.

491
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,860
I beg you.

492
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,660
Don't let me down.

493
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
Please.

494
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Stop the car.

495
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,060
I'm not going to the airport.

496
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,060
Teacher.

497
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
Stop the car.

498
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,660
Stop the car.

499
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Teacher.

500
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,260
Stop the car.

501
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,060
Don't move.

502
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
Stop the car.

503
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Teacher.

504
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,260
Teacher, stop the car.

505
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,860
Stop the car.

506
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,860
Stop the car.

507
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
Stop the car.

508
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,860
Teacher.

509
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Where is Jian Xin?

510
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
Jian Xin, she...

511
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,060
Is something wrong?

512
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,660
Say it.

513
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,700
Xianxi...

514
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,900
But what?

515
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,060
Xianxi!

516
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,100
Langfei.

517
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Aren't you asking for help?

518
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,860
It's the teacher.

519
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,580
How is the doctor?

520
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,860
Fortunately, he was sent to the emergency room.

521
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,140
If he was a little later,

522
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
it would be very dangerous.

523
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,380
Doctor, in that case,

524
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,900
the patient is not in danger, right?

525
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,460
When will he wake up?

526
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,100
The patient's head was hit severely.

527
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,660
There is a lot of bruising on his head.

528
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,620
When will he wake up?

529
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,020
We can't be sure for now.

530
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,380
We need to do further examination.

531
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,580
Teacher.

532
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,460
Teacher.

533
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,500
Спdogs

534
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,100
Xianxi.

535
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,540
I need some food.

536
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,560
It was all my fault

537
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,200
It has nothing with you

538
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,820
If I'm not the kind of teacher

539
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,360
No wedding will be held

540
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,520
I'd better not lie to you

541
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,120
But the teacher wasAll for my every intention

542
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,800
If i did it wrong

543
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,760
Can you stop placing all responsibilities on your own body

544
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,500
Jinxin

545
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,720
these are my sins

546
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,780
They were all conjoined

547
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,080
you

548
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
If I could be more rational,

549
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,100
and handle this matter better,

550
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
it wouldn't be like this.

551
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,100
I'm sorry.

552
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
I'm sorry.

553
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
I'm sorry.

554
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
I'm sorry.

555
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
I'm sorry.

556
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
I'm sorry.

557
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
I'm sorry.

558
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
I'm sorry.

559
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,100
I'm sorry.

560
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
I'm sorry.

561
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
I'm sorry.

562
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I'm sorry.

563
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,100
I'm sorry.

564
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
I'm sorry.

565
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Let's go.

566
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
Let's go.

567
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Let's go.

568
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Let's go.

569
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
Let's go.

570
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Let's go.

571
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Come on.

572
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Come on.

573
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Hi.

574
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
What is it?

575
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Hi.

576
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,100
I was the teacher who gave me a chance.

577
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,100
If it wasn't for the teacher,

578
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
I wouldn't be here today.

579
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
I thought you would.

580
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
So you wouldn't understand.

581
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,100
When everyone was questioning you,

582
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
suddenly someone told you

583
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
to believe in yourself.

584
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Everything will be fine.

585
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
At that time,

586
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
you would feel

587
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,100
that you were all about strength.

588
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,100
It's like you have hope tomorrow.

589
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
So...

590
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
No matter what the teacher did wrong,

591
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
I wouldn't blame him.

592
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,100
Besides,

593
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,100
this could have been better.

594
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
I was too impulsive.

595
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
I shouldn't have questioned him.

596
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Now,

597
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
I just hope the teacher wakes up soon.

598
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,100
If he still wants me to go to America with him,

599
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
I will go too.

600
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,100
Even if you don't want to leave,

601
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Jianxi,

602
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
you are a strange person.

603
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
Fusheng,

604
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,100
if you have the same experience as me,

605
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,100
you will understand.

606
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
In fact, in this world,

607
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,100
no one will treat you well.

608
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
So,

609
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
everyone who treats you well

610
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,100
should be grateful and cherished.

611
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,100
Jianxi, come to the hospital.

612
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
Jianxi.

613
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
Jianxi.

614
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,100
This is for you.

615
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
Where is the teacher now?

616
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
When the teacher wakes up,

617
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
she asks for a transfer.

618
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
Where is she now?

619
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
She just doesn't want you to know.

620
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
So you don't need to ask.

621
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
She said,

622
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,100
before you get the best actress,

623
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
she won't come to see you.

624
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
The best actress?

625
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Yes.

626
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
She wants you to continue to participate in the rose life.

627
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
And you must get

628
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
the best actress of this year.

629
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
I didn't expect you to come back.

630
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
I came back

631
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,100
to get the best actress.

632
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
So,

633
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
I want to make the rose life better.

634
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,100
I know you are the donor.

635
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,100
That doesn't mean I forgive you.

636
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
I know.

637
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
I know.

638
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
I know.

639
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
I know.

640
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I know.

641
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
I know.

642
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
Director, let's start.

643
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
Okay.

644
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
Get ready.

645
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,100
The rose life

646
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Dear guests.

647
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,500
The final round of the competition is approaching.

648
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,300
Tonight, we will announce the winner of this year's Best Actress.

649
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,100
Who will she be?

650
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,100
She is a well-known actress.

651
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,700
She is also the first female actress of this year.

652
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,900
Let's guess together.

653
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:24,300
Jian Xi!

654
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,500
Congratulations, Jian Xi.

655
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,700
The Best Actress of Phoenix Film Festival.

656
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,900
Congratulations.

657
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
She is a famous actress.

658
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,300
Let's welcome the winner of Phoenix Film Festival,

659
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,500
the Best Actress,

660
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,700
Miss Zhan Mei, to come up to the stage and give her an award.

661
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,700
Congratulations.

662
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,300
The Best Actress of Phoenix Film Festival.

663
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,700
Congratulations.

664
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,300
The Best Actress of Phoenix Film Festival.

665
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,700
It's you.

666
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,700
Thank you, Mom.

667
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,500
If you had let Jian Xi leave,

668
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,700
you would have been the Best Actress of Phoenix Film Festival.

669
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,300
Do you regret it now?

670
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,300
If you hadn't helped me back then,

671
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,100
you would still be the CEO of Gong Yi Le.

672
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,300
Do you regret it now?

673
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,700
Since the day I started acting,

674
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
someone told me,

675
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,900
Jian Xi, you are not pretty enough,

676
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
and not smart enough.

677
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,500
You will give up soon.

678
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,900
I really had to leave many times.

679
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
But I am very happy.

680
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
I was scolded by someone.

681
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,300
I am standing here today to tell everyone,

682
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
no matter what setbacks you encounter,

683
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,900
even if you have nothing,

684
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,300
don't give up easily.

685
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
As long as you have a dream,

686
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,900
you will have it.

687
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,900
Here, I want to thank

688
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,700
the people who have always helped and encouraged me.

689
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,100
Lastly, I want to say,

690
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,700
thank you.

691
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,900
Congratulations to Jian Xi again.

692
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,900
Let's give her the most enthusiastic applause.

693
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,500
I wish you happiness.

694
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,100
Jian Xi, you got the Best Actress award.

695
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,300
Do you have anything to say to the audience?

696
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,700
Tell us how you feel.

697
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Yes, tell us.

698
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,900
What do you think?

699
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,300
What do you think?

700
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,900
What do you think?

701
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,700
Ji Qing.

702
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,100
Ji Qing, you lost to Jian Xi.

703
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,300
How do you feel?

704
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Yes, I heard you prepared for a year.

705
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,100
You still lost.

706
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
What do you think?

707
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,500
I lost, but I can afford it.

708
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,100
If I don't win this year,

709
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,900
I will win next year.

710
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,900
Congratulations.

711
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,500
Thank you.

712
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,300
What are you thinking?

713
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
I didn't think

714
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,700
I really won the Best Actress award.

715
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,900
You should be happy to have the award.

716
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,100
I thought I could talk to the teacher today.

717
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,700
Maybe he doesn't want to see me.

718
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,700
I think Lu Zhou doesn't not want to see you.

719
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,700
He thinks you don't need him anymore.

720
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,700
You have become very strong.

721
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,500
You can support the path behind by yourself.

722
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,900
As a guide, Lu Zhou

723
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,300
should let go of you.

724
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Maybe.

725
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,100
Actually...

726
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
Tang Fei,

727
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,700
I have something to tell you.

728
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
I want to leave here.

729
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
Where are you going?

730
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,700
I want to take care of myself and study.

731
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,500
I want to learn different ways of acting.

732
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Like the teacher said,

733
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,100
I want to take my time

734
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,100
and walk slowly.

735
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,900
Will you blame me?

736
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,700
Of course I will blame you.

737
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,900
But I want to scold you

738
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,500
for my bad temper two years ago.

739
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,300
But I also know

740
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,900
you have always been like this.

741
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,900
I didn't say anything

742
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,500
about your decision.

743
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,100
If that's the case,

744
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,500
what can I do?

745
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,100
No matter where you go,

746
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
how long,

747
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,700
one year, two years,

748
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,500
five years, ten years,

749
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,300
when you finish what you want to do,

750
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,100
remember to come back.

751
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,700
I'll always be here.

752
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,300
I'll wait for you.

753
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,900
Thank you.

754
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,500
You really want to let him go?

755
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,900
Now that you let go of Jian Xi,

756
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,300
even Anxin left.

757
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,900
Anxin, when will you come back?

758
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,900
Anxin, when will you come back?

759

Tang Fei!

760
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,100
I've called Yue Le.

761
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,700
He said Tang Fei is going to be here tonight.

762
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,900
He might not be able to pick you up.

00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,300
It's okay.

764
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,500
I also heard that

765
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,100
he's been filming the same movie with Ji Qin.

766
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,300
Aren't you a little nervous?

767
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,700
Not at all.

00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
Okay.

This is the address. Do you want it?

771
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,500

You're not going to be able to get out.

You're being eaten.
