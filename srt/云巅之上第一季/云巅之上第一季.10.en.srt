1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Take this road down

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't care who is more gentle

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, in the second year

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will be a magical eye

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,800
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
The weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Use all your strength to fight against the most real you

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
No matter what the little tricks

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what rumors

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,000
I will definitely be invincible

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't care if you are willing

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,360
In the past, I kept the sweetness

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,680
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,000
My heart is here

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
Even if the world is invincible

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,880
I'm only one you

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,840
Episode 28

28
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,040
Xi Xi

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,520
It's me, Xie Xin. Open the door.

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,920
Xie Xin!

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,720
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,320
It's good that you're fine.

33
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,720
Why did you come to see me so late?

34
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
I just came back from the hospital

35
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,920
and heard what happened at the company's door.

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,520
So I came to see you.

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm fine.

38
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,120
Really? I'm fine.

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Jingxi.

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
How is Ji Qing?

41
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,920
She just removed the gauze.

42
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,320
But she's still calm now.

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,920
Then, take good care of her.

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,320
You have to film and take care of Ji Qing at the hospital.

45
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,520
It's okay if you don't come with me.

46
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,120
It's late. Go home.

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,320
Why are you lying?

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
What lie?

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,720
You're pretending.

50
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm pretending.

51
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,720
I said I'm fine. What are you pretending?

52
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,920
You think you're great and strong, right?

53
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,320
Don't keep everything in your heart.

54
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,120
Can you tell me?

55
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,920
Tang Fei.

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,320
What now?

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,120
I...

58
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,120
I think we're not suitable.

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
Let's stop here.

60
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Let's go.

61
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
What do you mean by that?

62
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,920
What's the reason? Why?

63
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Ji Qing has always liked you.

64
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,720
She's so good. You should cherish her.

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,120
But I don't like her.

66
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,720
But she's hurt because of you. You should be responsible.

67
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,120
Emotion is emotion. Responsibility is responsibility.

68
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,520
I have so many fans.

69
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,920
Do you mean I should be responsible for everyone?

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm not a saint. I can't care about how many people feel.

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,920
I can only take care of myself.

72
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,320
I know very well that I'm just grateful and sorry to Ji Qing.

73
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
I've never loved her.

74
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,720
If it's because she's hurt,

75
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,920
I'm not responsible for her if I'm with her.

76
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,120
You're so...

77
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,520
Do you have too many idol fans?

78
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,520
What are you thinking about?

79
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,920
It's none of my business.

80
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Go back and rest.

81
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,120
Go.

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,720
Enough.

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
I won't agree to it.

84
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,920
I won't even die.

85
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
I don't love you anymore.

86
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,920
I've never loved you.

87
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,520
Do you hear me?

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Jin Xi, don't be a child, okay?

89
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm not joking.

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
Calm down, okay?

91
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,320
Go.

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,520
Jin Xi, listen to me.

93
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,320
Jin Xi.

94
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
Jin Xi.

95
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,720
Jin Xi.

96
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Those fans are really crazy.

97
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,120
They even found a company.

98
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,320
Do you really think Shen Yan has such a strong appeal?

99
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,420
That one thing that he was so pitiful about

100
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,720
indeed has won a lot of sympathy.

101
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,920
But this time, it's not that simple.

102
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,320
You mean all these things were planned in advance?

103
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,220
Of course.

104
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,420
Now, the internet has started to talk about letting Jian Xi get out of the entertainment industry.

105
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,920
And the Weibo's rumors are even more unnoticeable.

106
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,020
And those fans are going crazy.

107
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,420
So, this is a plan.

108
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,720
Those comments are all fake?

109
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,920
I've investigated the Weibo that left a message to Jian Xi.

110
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,520
Most of them are new users who registered temporarily.

111
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,720
And all the big online forums

112
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,820
are full of posts that attack Jian Xi.

113
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,120
Most of the IDs come from a famous marketing company.

114
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,820
So I'm sure this is a plan of cyber violence.

115
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,320
You mean someone is trying to blackmail me?

116
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,420
Just relying on a group of water army can affect all the public opinion?

117
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,620
The rumors are indeed very deadly.

118
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,520
They are very smart.

119
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,820
First, they want the public opinion to blackmail Jian Xi's image

120
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
and cause a lot of attacks.

121
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Second, they want Shen Yan to keep crying in front of the media

122
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
and earn more sympathy.

123
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,920
Third, they want to make the fans crazy

124
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,720
and completely destroy Jian Xi.

125
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,520
This is too crazy.

126
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,220
Ordinary people are not aware of the Weibo and the forum.

127
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,320
Especially Shen Yan.

128
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,620
They want the fans and the internet to find the highest moral point.

129
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,120
Because everyone is sympathetic to the weak.

130
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
So, naturally,

131
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Jian Xi is being demonized and attacked.

132
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,820
What should we do?

133
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,320
What we should do is to keep silent.

134
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Jian Xi, there's no other way.

135
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
You are tied up by the public opinion.

136
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,920
You have to endure all the grievances.

137
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Even if you want to die, you have to endure it.

138
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,220
Don't say I can't do it.

139
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,120
I don't know what I did wrong.

140
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,820
Suddenly, it became the target of the whole world.

141
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,220
Can't they see me acting so calmly?

142
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
Just because of Shen Yan's tears,

143
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,420
I became a mouse?

144
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,320
This is too unfair.

145
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
Jian Xi, calm down.

146
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,720
I promise you, I will handle this for you.

147
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:11,920
Okay?

148
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,220
How will you handle it?

149
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,220
There's no way to handle it.

150
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,020
Jian Xi, can you not be so naive?

151
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,220
Being a person is not black and white.

152
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,620
First, you said something you shouldn't have said on the show.

153
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,220
Now, you don't want to compromise.

154
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,520
You are strong everywhere.

155
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,420
What's the benefit of this?

156
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,420
Lu Zhou, can you not say that about him?

157
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,020
Yes, it's all my fault.

158
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,620
I'll give you guys a hard time.

159
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,620
Jian Xi!

160
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,620
Lu Zhou, he didn't do anything wrong.

161
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,020
He's too straightforward.

162
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,820
That's why he's being used by others.

163
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,620
Then what do you want him to do?

164
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,920
If his psychological endurance can only reach here,

165
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,320
then his acting career can only reach here.

166
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,720
Let him face it himself.

167
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,020
Let him face it himself!

168
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,820
I'm his agent.

169
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,620
I won't do anything like you!

170
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,820
We meet again.

171
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,620
Aren't you going to ask me why?

172
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,620
You must be very confused.

173
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,820
Why have you been attacked so much lately?

174
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
You already said the reason.

175
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
Do I still need to ask?

176
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,220
Ke Luo is dating me.

177
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,020
He used to love you so much,

178
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,020
but now he belongs to me.

179
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,820
You've always been very lucky.

180
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
People like you wherever you go.

181
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
But I'm different.

182
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,020
My manhood has always been very bad.

183
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,020
My ex-boyfriends

184
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,220
took all the money I had

185
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,020
and gambled it all away.

186
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,020
I was so depressed.

187
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
Later,

188
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
I met Lu Zhou.

189
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,620
I realized that

190
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,420
there's a man like that in this world.

191
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
If he's willing to be with me,

192
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,420
I can give up everything for him.

193
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,420
But he didn't.

194
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,620
What does this have to do with Ke Luo?

195
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,820
Lu Zhou doesn't even look at me.

196
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,420
It's because of you!

197
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,620
If it wasn't for you,

198
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,620
he would definitely be with me!

199
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,620
So,

200
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,820
I'm going to take Ke Luo away from you.

201
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,020
He used to love you so much,

202
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,020
but now he loves me.

203
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
Tell me,

204
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,620
how can I not be happy?

205
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
Are you crazy?

206
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,820
Yes, yes, yes.

207
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,620
I just like your expression.

208
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,220
It's like someone took the little girl from me.

209
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,420
I'm surprised.

210
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,620
I'm afraid.

211
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,820
I'm angry.

212
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,620
But I can't do anything about it.

213
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,620
Keep it up.

214
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,620
I'll be happy if you keep it up.

215
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,220
No one can lie forever.

216
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,020
The fake mask will be removed one day.

217
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,020
You've already gotten out of the entertainment industry.

218
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,020
You're mean.

219
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,420
Don't you understand?

220
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,020
I didn't plan this.

221
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
What is it?

222
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,020
The real mastermind is Qi Wen Sen.

223
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,020
This anger is from the attention of the whole country.

224
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Everyone wants you to get out.

225
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,020
Be careful!

226
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,020
Ke Luo, it's okay.

227
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,020
What are you laughing at?

228
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,620
Laughing at you.

229
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,620
Laughing at me?

230
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,620
Look at yourself.

231
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,620
You're doing it now.

232
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,620
Ke Luo,

233
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm a friend.

234
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,020
I'm trying to persuade you.

235
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,420
He's a liar.

236
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,020
Think about it.

237
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,620
He can leave every time something happens.

238
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,620
He used the sympathy of others to pretend to be innocent.

239
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,420
He's always acting pitiful.

240
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,420
I don't believe it.

241
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,620
It's easy to prove everything during time.

242
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,620
I hope you won't regret it...

243
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,620
the day when the exposed truth came out.

244
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,620
Ke Lu, he's jealous of us.

245
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,620
Jealous that we're having such a good time.

246
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
Take care.

247
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,620
Ke Luo...

248
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,620
It's okay.

249
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,620
I believe you.

250
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,620
Let's discuss the contract again.

251
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,620
Have you remembered everything I told you?

252
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Yes, I have. Don't worry, Mr. Qi.

253
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,620
Qi Wen Si!

254
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,620
What are you doing?

255
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,620
Jing Wei!

256
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,620
Tian Xi, are you crazy?

257
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Jing Wei!

258
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
This time, I'll give you a discount.

259
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
I won't let you off next time.

260
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,620
Miss Jin.

261
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,620
Let me go!

262
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Let me go!

263
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,620
Let her go.

264
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,620
You're as dirty as this water.

265
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,620
Mr. Qi, should we call the police?

266
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,620
No.

267
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,620
Get out of here!

268
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Let's go.

269
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
I'm busy.

270
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,620
What do you want from me?

271
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,620
I'm busy.

272
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,620
Didn't you cancel your trip?

273
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Jian Xi didn't even get to film a play.

274
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,620
What's the point of being her agent?

275
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,620
If you're here to talk me into it,

276
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,620
please get out of here.

277
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,620
Take a look.

278
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,620
What is it?

279
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
Advertising contract.

280
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,620
You should know the importance of this company.

281
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,620
It's very difficult to get this advertisement.

282
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,620
Tell Jian Xi.

283
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,620
She must seize this opportunity.

284
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
What's wrong?

285
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,620
Did the sun come out from the west?

286
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,620
Or you didn't take your medicine today?

287
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,620
I didn't take my medicine today.

288
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,620
I deliberately wrote you a fake contract

289
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,620
to make you run out of your legs.

290
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
How did I teach you back then?

291
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,620
Don't mention the past.

292
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
I'm really good to you.

293
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,620
Good to me?

294
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,620
I'm too lazy to mention the past to you.

295
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,620
And I don't need this contract.

296
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
Meatball,

297
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,620
you should know that as an agent,

298
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
you must clear your head.

299
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,620
Would I hurt Jian Xi?

300
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
You didn't take your medicine.

301
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,620
Okay.

302
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,620
Then give me a reasonable explanation.

303
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,620
Don't get me wrong.

304
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
I'm not helping you.

305
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,620
I saw Jian Xi working very hard.

306
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,620
I just want to help her.

307
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
And then?

308
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
But,

309
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,620
don't tell her that I provided her with the contract.

310
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Do you understand?

311
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
Why?

312
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Didn't you see that Jian Xi was hiding from Tang Fei?

313
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,620
So I don't have time to chat with you.

314
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,620
But you must remember.

315
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,620
Don't tell her.

316
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,620
Do you understand?

317
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
You called me here

318
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,620
and kept talking.

319
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,620
You said you didn't have time to chat with me.

320
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
So I have time to chat with you, right?

321
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,620
I'm the one who's talking to you.

322
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,620
Is that okay?

323
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,620
Okay.

324
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Yes.

325
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
I'll go and talk to you later.

326
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,620
Okay.

327
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,620
I'm going to the bathroom.

328
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,620
See you later.

329
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,620
It's your favorite.

330
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,620
Enough.

331
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
That's it.

332
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,620
Thank you.

333
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,620
Please hurry up.

334
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,620
Okay.

335
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,620
Why did you ask me out to dinner?

336
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,420
Besides, we haven't signed the contract yet.

337
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,660
What if something changes?

338
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,100
There's no chance.

339
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,340
I've already talked to Mr. Sun.

340
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,700
You can rest assured.

341
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,540
Thank you.

342
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,460
Why are you thanking me?

343
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,660
You're so polite.

344
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,300
A good agent like you

345
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,020
should have better development.

346
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,100
You chose to stay with me.

347
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,180
Jianxi,

348
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
in this industry,

349
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,180
making money is important.

350
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,980
But you have to learn to be a person first.

351
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,260
If you encounter any problems,

352
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,220
I'll run away.

353
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,940
My conscience will not be able to get through.

354
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,860
I won't go.

355
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,380
Besides, we're family.

356
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,340
Do you think

357
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,740
I'm not worthy of your trust?

358
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,580
That's not what I mean.

359
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,660
Then what do you mean?

360
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,060
I don't care what you mean.

361
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,140
Let's raise a toast

362
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,940
to celebrate

363
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,140
we've received this order.

364
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,540
We've successfully re-signed the contract.

365
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,220
Okay?

366
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,660
Give it to me.

367
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,420
What's wrong?

368
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
I just remembered

369
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,180
you're injured and can't drink.

370
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,580
I'm almost recovered.

371
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,380
What are you doing?

372
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,700
You can't drink the spicy food.

373
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,460
Wait for me.

374
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,180
Where are you going?

375
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,060
To the park.

376
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,740
Mei.

377
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,900
You're here so early.

378
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,340
Let's go.

379
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,900
Okay.

380
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,260
Mei,

381
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,780
I've invited you over and over again.

382
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,980
But you didn't show up.

383
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,380
I didn't expect

384
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,980
you'd ask me out today.

385
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,820
What's going on?

386
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,020
Mr. Sun,

387
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,500
have you found

388
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
the spokesperson for this year's ad?

389
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,660
I've found

390
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
the person for this.

391
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,260
Who's so lucky?

392
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
The actress

393
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,340
who played the movie,

394
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,740
The Fierce One.

395
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,980
Her name is...

396
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:53,980
Jian...

397
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,100
Jian Xi.

398
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,260
Yes, her name is Jian Xi.

399
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,860
I thought it was someone else.

400
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
It's her.

401
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,180
Mei,

402
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
you know her?

403
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,420
Of course.

404
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,780
I've only met her once.

405
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,340
I'm not very fond of

406
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
her.

407
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,620
I used her

408
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,100
because Tang Fei recommended her.

409
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,580
What do you think of her?

410
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,580
Mr. Sun has a sharp eye.

411
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,140
He won't mistake her.

412
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,340
This Miss Jian

413
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,740
is a good actress.

414
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,740
She's a good choice.

415
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
I knew it.

416
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,380
But...

417
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,460
Although she's a bit talented,

418
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,220
her shortcomings

419
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,940
are not known by your company.

420
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,020
As an actress,

421
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,220
you have to be

422
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,820
very kind

423
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,340
to make everything go smoothly.

424
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,140
As for Jian Xi,

425
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,420
although she's a bit arrogant,

426
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,820
she's very generous.

427
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,700
But she's stubborn

428
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,340
and a bit arrogant.

429
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,340
Qi Wen Sen

430
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,860
doesn't dare to use her.

431
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,060
She's almost in the fridge now.

432
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,220
Really?

433
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,860
If that's the case,

434
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,940
it's easy.

435
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,380
The most terrifying thing is

436
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,060
that she has offended

437
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,580
too many people.

438
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,900
She's been made a mess.

439
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,380
She's even been a big hit.

440
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,260
I'm afraid that

441
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,460
she's ranked first

442
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,940
on the audience's ratings list.

443
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,020
Rating list?

444
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,420
A top actress on the ratings list

445
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,180
can't even sell her

446
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,180
products.

447
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,580
Mr. Sun, do you dare to use her?

448
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,780
How can I use someone like her?

449
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,140
Tang Fei is really...

450
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,180
How can she recommend

451
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,140
such an actress to me?

452
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,020
Tang Fei has a wide range of talents.

453
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,380
She can't be rejected for a moment.

454
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,620
It's normal to help her friends.

455
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,500
If Mr. Sun is willing,

456
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,580
I have

457
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,380
a better candidate.

458
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,340
Mei,

459
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,940
is it Zuo Zuo?

460
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,220
That's not good.

461
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,020
She's still in court.

462
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,500
Are you talking about

463
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,220
the murder case?

464
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,780
The police have investigated it.

465
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,220
There's no solid evidence.

466
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,700
Don't worry.

467
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,420
I still think

468
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,740
it's better to find

469
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,780
a better actress.

470
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,380
Isn't it...

471
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
If I say

472
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,660
I'm willing to go out with Zuo Zuo?

473
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,580
If you go out with her,

474
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,780
it'll be different.

475
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Zuo Zuo is just a flower.

476
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,460
It's not a problem.

477
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,300
I'm the top actress on the ratings list, right?

478
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,780
I'm doing this for my daughter.

479
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
I'm not a bad person.

480
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,580
You're trying to make your daughter a good actress.

481
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,780
You're trying to slander me in front of the ads.

482
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,380
I'm not trying to be nice to you.

483
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,580
But you shouldn't treat me like this.

484
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,580
Jian Xi,

485
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,180
you're about to have a child.

486
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,020
You're going to be a star

487
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,780
and fall into the pit again.

488
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,900
Don't you understand why?

489
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,980
Why?

490
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,380
You're just being impulsive.

491
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,900
It proves

492
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,660
you're not suitable for this field.

493
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,100
You're so hypocritical and selfish.

494
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,700
You're not suitable for this field?

495
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,500
You can't even control your temper.

496
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,380
No matter how good you are,

497
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,100
no matter how talented you are,

498
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,820
you're still useless.

499
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,820
Mr. Sun,

500
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,860
let's talk somewhere else.

501
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,820
Okay.

502
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,980
Don't waste your time.

503
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,100
I advise you

504
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,980
to leave the entertainment industry.

505
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,180
Zuo Zuo,

506
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,860
what do you want to say to Mr. Sun?

507
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,060
You're not worthy of my respect.

508
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,580
How could you both say that?

509
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,500
editors.

510
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,660
Who's saying,

511
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,740
I shouldn't give my kid the right answer,

512
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,100
nor am I able to give you the wrong answer.

513
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,060
I...

514
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,580
I never briefed him much.

515
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,520
Maybe I did all wrong.

516
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,600
He's not the one that I think Netweed just wants to talk to.

517
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,780
Is there a way to make him protect me?

518
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,180
What?

519
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,960
The music video was supposed to be the script of the haywire.

520
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,180
But I tallest correctlyuration.

521
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,340
If I do the right thing,

522
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,100
then heating with a lighter makes people more handsome.

523
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,900
I'm convinced.

524
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,900
Hello, I'm Anxin.

525
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,900
It's me. Where is Jianxi?

526
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
She's been busy lately.

527
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Why can't I get through her phone calls?

528
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
I can't even find her at the office.

529
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Where is she?

530
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,900
I'm not sure either.

531
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,900
You're her agent. Who knows?

532
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,900
Jianxi can't hold on anymore.

533
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
What do you mean?

534
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,900
I've never seen her so down.

535
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
She's not even fighting.

536
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
She's gone.

537
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,900
She even told me to bring someone else.

538
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
I don't want to bother her anymore.

539
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
She doesn't want to be an actress anymore?

540
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Yes. She gave up acting.

541
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,900
She doesn't want to be scolded anymore.

542
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Tang Fei, I feel really bad right now.

543
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
How about we talk another day?

544
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
I'll go.

545
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,900
Jiqing, you can't just stop taking medicine.

546
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,900
What medicine?

547
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
I thought the eight-game was good.

548
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Look at this.

549
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,480
Weули, can you please shower her generously with clean water this time?

550
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,400
Actually, just this time...

551
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,200
Sir, if you're okay, isn't it safe to say,

552
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,900
if you're committing your mistake,

553
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,280
I would forget it.

554
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,300
manually to yet another day

555
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,100
cop car

556
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,900
I've been cheese

557
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,260
You're not willing to be Hua Ping.

558
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,140
You keep challenging yourself.

559
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,660
But I didn't expect that you'd be defeated by a little kid.

560
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,980
Where's your determination? Where's your strength?

561
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,420
I didn't expect you to be so weak.

562
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,220
I'm really disappointed in you.

563
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,380
Tang Fei, I...

564
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,420
You're so sad now.

565
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,980
Because you're afraid you'll never be Hua Ping, right?

566
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,060
Tang Fei, can you be more gentle?

567
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,500
I can coax her, I can also lie to her.

568
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,460
That will only make her feel uncomfortable and unable to move on.

569
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,340
Let me tell you, even if it's a good surgery,

570
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,940
your injury won't heal.

571
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,620
What should we do then? Are you not going to live anymore?

572
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,500
Just crying and begging for sympathy every day?

573
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,380
Tang Fei, you're too mean.

574
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,900
You met me on the first day, and I'm just like that.

575
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,580
I'm sorry.

576
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,060
Tang Fei, don't go.

577
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,860
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

578
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,260
I was too weak.

579
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,540
Tang Fei, I promise you, I won't do this again.

580
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,300
No matter how bad it is, I will continue acting.

581
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,380
Don't be mad at me anymore, okay?

582
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,660
Ji Xiang, listen to me.

583
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,020
I'm not as good as you think I am.

584
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,940
I'm very mean.

585
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,580
I'm not...

586
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,460
It's okay. I don't care.

587
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,460
As long as you're with me for a while, that's enough.

588
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,060
Tang Fei, give me some courage, okay?

589
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,340
I can do it.

590
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,260
Teacher.

591
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,540
Let's go, come in.

592
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,340
I'm here to say goodbye.

593
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,180
Whether it's a goodbye or an apology,

594
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,140
come in, then we can talk.

595
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,580
Teacher once said that as an actor,

596
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,580
you should fight for honor and get everyone's approval.

597
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,580
But I'm very incompetent.

598
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,580
I lost the best actress and the audience.

599
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,580
A woman like me who doesn't have an audience,

600
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,580
can I not continue?

601
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,580
Is this the real reason?

602
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,580
And my mother,

603
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
she hates me too.

604
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,580
And she's also injured.

605
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
Since so many people hate me,

606
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,580
I might as well lose myself.

607
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
I don't want to be scolded anymore.

608
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,580
I don't want to continue to suffer like this.

609
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,580
That's why I want to leave.

610
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Come with me.

611
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,580
Look.

612
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,580
This is the best new actor award.

613
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,580
When I was acting in this movie,

614
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
I acted as an assassin.

615
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,580
In the 20 degree weather,

616
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,580
I was like a soldier.

617
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,580
I was fighting in the snow.

618
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,580
In the end, my hands and feet were all injured.

619
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,580
This is the best male role.

620
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,580
When I was acting in this movie,

621
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,580
I was held by the other person by a glass bottle.

622
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
When I was sent to the hospital,

623
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
I was already in a coma.

624
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,580
If I was a little more biased,

625
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,580
my right eye would be blind.

626
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,580
I was in the hospital for two months.

627
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,580
In the end, I was in a coma.

628
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,580
I won this award.

629
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,580
And this is the best male lead.

630
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
Teacher, don't say it anymore.

631
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,580
I've already made a decision.

632
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,580
I won't change it easily.

633
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,580
When I was acting in this movie,

634
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,580
I became like this.

635
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,580
Brother Nu, don't you need a bodyguard?

636
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,580
Don't worry. I can do it myself.

637
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Be careful, Brother Nu.

638
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,580
Okay, let's go after them.

639
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Teacher Lu, how are you?

640
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,580
Are you okay?

641
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
Be careful.

642
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,580
Slowly.

643
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
Don't touch Teacher Lu's feet.

644
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,580
Be careful.

645
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Be careful.

646
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
This way.

647
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,580
Why did I try so hard to act?

648
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,580
Just to win these awards.

649
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,580
I just wanted everyone to recognize me.

650
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,580
I like acting.

651
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,580
If I'm not injured,

652
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
I will keep acting.

653
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,580
I will keep acting until the end of my life.

654
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
Teacher, don't say it anymore.

655
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
I've tried my best.

656
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
But I still can't.

657
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Can't?

658
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
Who told you that?

659
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,580
The heart can control the body.

660
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,580
The will can overcome pain.

661
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,580
No one can say no until the last moment.

662
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,580
Teacher.

663
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
Look.

664
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Look at my leg.

665
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
Did you see it?

666
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
It's so funny when I walk on the street.

667
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Did you see it?

668
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Do you think I'm willing to hide in a dark corner?

669
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,580
Do you think I'm willing to retreat?

670
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,580
No.

671
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,580
Of course not.

672
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,580
I have talent.

673
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
I'm an actor who deserves it.

674
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,580
But...

675
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
But no matter what I do,

676
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,580
no one can give a male lead to a disabled one.

677
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
I like acting.

678
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
Acting is my life.

679
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,580
But in reality,

680
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,580
reality has taken away my favorite acting.

681
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
But you?

682
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,580
You have talent.

683
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,580
You have to give up.

684
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Why?

685
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
Is it for the sake of the meaningless arguments?

686
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Is it for the sake of the ridiculous jealousy?

687
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,580
No matter what they hit you or scold you,

688
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
they took your eyes away

689
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
or took your legs away.

690
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,580
Everyone in this world,

691
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,580
God will give them different missions,

692
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
different talents.

693
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
The more talented they are,

694
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
the more different they are.

695
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
But when they are more mature,

696
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,580
but become mediocre,

697
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
but forget their own talent,

698
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
why?

699
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
Because in the eyes of the ordinary people,

700
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,580
this is the unbreakable.

701
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
They gave up their dreams.

702
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
They gave up their struggle.

703
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,580
What is the final result?

704
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,580
Look for yourself.

705
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
Go to the streets and see.

706
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,580
See those so-called walking dead.

707
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,580
They have no ideals.

708
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,580
They have no ambitions.

709
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,580
They live in a hazy state.

710
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
They do what they don't like.

711
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,580
They waste their lives.

712
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
But you have them all.

713
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
You have them all.

714
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
Why did you give up?

715
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
Did you want to waste them all?

716
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
I tell you, even if you want to,

717
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
I will never allow it.

718
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Teacher, I am not in this circle.

719
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
It's okay. You are an actor.

720
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
Acting is enough. You have talent.

721
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
Jianxi,

722
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,580
you have to use your own strength

723
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,580
to prove to the world

724
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,580
that you are an actor without any regrets.

725
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,580
I...

726
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
Anxin, what are you doing here?

727
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
I said I don't like to say goodbye.

728
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
I am not here to say goodbye.

729
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
I am here to apologize to you.

730
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,580
Apologize?

731
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,580
You are an excellent agent.

732
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,580
You have always done your best for me.

733
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,580
Really.

734
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,580
I am very grateful to you.

735
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,580
So, I hope from now on,

736
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,580
can I

737
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
let you

738
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
continue to help me, continue to take care of me?

739
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,580
You are not leaving?

740
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Teacher told me, if I leave this time,

741
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
I will regret it to death.

742
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
I thought about it later.

743
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,580
Every time I encounter a setback,

744
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
I always leave with a bag.

745
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,580
I am so failed.

746
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580
I don't want to be a failure.

747
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
I don't care about that.

748
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,580
As long as you are ready,

749
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
we can start at any time.

750
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
But,

751
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
can you accept those bad sounds?

752
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
I will learn

753
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,580
to make myself strong.

754
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
The bad sound,

755
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
I will pretend I didn't hear it or see it.

756
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,580
From today,

757
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
I will be your eyes and ears.

758
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
The first step,

759
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,580
let's start from the public service movie.

760
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,580
Public service movie?

761
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,580
Brother Fei,

762
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,580
I am at the door to meet a reporter.

763
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,580
You and Jing Qing can go from the back door.

764
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:58,940
ideological

765
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Are you okay?

766
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,860
Honestly,

767
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
I don't dare to see anyone.

768
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,580
Though,

769
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,440
but it's completely different

770
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,320
for actors.

771
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,680
But Ji Qing, you've always been a public figure.

772
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,440
You always face the media.

773
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,440
You can't avoid this.

774
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,600
Then give me a little more time.

775
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,880
I have no other choice.

776
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,240
Director Wang, I heard that you're investigating

777
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,080
the female lead of this public service movie.

778
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,520
We're very interested in this role.

779
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,880
Miss Jian is passionate about public service.

780
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,200
It's really our honor.

781
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,360
It's like this.

782
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,760
Originally, my idea for this movie is

783
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,440
to use the struggle of a pregnant girl

784
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,040
to exchange for the public's love for this group.

785
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,680
That's great.

786
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,160
Our Jansi has played the female lead of ALS before.

787
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,560
She moved a lot of people.

788
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,040
This role really suits her.

789
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,120
Yes, I've heard of it.

790
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,360
But Miss Jian, to be honest,

791
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,640
we've been looking for a lot of female actors before.

792
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,800
We were very interested in them at first.

793
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,520
But it's a public service movie.

794
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,680
The struggle is not ideal.

795
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,640
Including the long period of time.

796
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,000
In the end, many actors gave up.

797
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,680
I don't know about Miss Jian.

798
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,640
Is there any problem with the time, the period,

799
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,800
and the struggle?

800
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,160
I can play Lin Tianchou.

801
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,280
You mean you don't want money?

802
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,600
Public service movies are for social service.

803
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,560
I can give up the struggle.

804
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,280
That's great.

805
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,880
Since Miss Jian is so passionate about public service,

806
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,080
I have nothing to say.

807
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,280
If possible,

808
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,480
let's talk about the contract today.

809
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,760
Thank you so much.

810
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,080
Let's sign the contract later.

811
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,440
Okay.

812
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,640
Director Wang.

813
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,520
What's up?

814
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,480
Didn't you see I have a guest?

815
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
Director Wang.

816
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
Miss Shen.

817
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,200
Why are you here?

818
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,840
Why didn't you call me in advance?

819
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,520
Director Wang has worked hard

820
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
to get the public service.

821
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,000
So I came here by myself.

822
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,080
I should do this.

823
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,320
Miss Shen, you are here today...

824
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,800
You mentioned to me last time

825
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,120
that you want me to be the leading actress.

826
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,600
Is that true?

827
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,800
As we all know,

828
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,960
you don't want to come here because you don't like the job.

829
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,480
What's wrong?

830
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,280
Why?

831
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,320
Are you sure you want to use Jianxi?

832
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,680
I'm busy.

833
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,440
I wish you a happy cooperation.

834
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,040
No, no.

835
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,640
Miss Shen, wait.

836
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,760
We are not sure yet.

837
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,520
We are still talking.

838
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,960
You just came in.

839
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,720
Just in time.

840
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,440
Director.

841
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,920
We just agreed to sign the contract.

842
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,120
What's going on?

843
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,480
Anxin.

844
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm not making a public service film.

845
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,960
The leading actress

846
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,520
will be the ambassador of Aisin.

847
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,440
For the requirements of actresses,

848
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,920
it's better to be good at acting.

849
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,640
But I have other ideas.

850
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,560
Next time,

851
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,800
we will have a chance to cooperate,

852
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,120
right?

853
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,200
It's not appropriate to do this.

854
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,880
Anxin, let's go.

855
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,040
Miss Jian.

856
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,560
I'm so sorry.

857
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,680
I hope we can cooperate in the future.

858
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,800
It's okay.

859
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,120
If there is a public service project,

860
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,080
you can come to me anytime.

861
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,680
It's a polite word.

862
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,720
Sorry.

863
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,400
I only talk to humans.

864
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,640
What did you say?

865
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,960
I said you are not a human.

866
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,040
Miss Jian, see you.

867
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,680
Okay, okay.

868
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,480
Don't pull me.

869
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,600
A public service film like this

870
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,480
is low in cost

871
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,960
and it takes so much time.

872
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,320
How can a woman

873
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,720
who is unyielding be accepted?

874
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,440
It's just for business.

875
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,080
Shen Yan's image is more positive than mine.

876
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,320
It's normal for them to use him.

877
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,640
Don't be angry.

878
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,240
How can I not be angry?

879
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,080
I wanted to take this kind of public service film

880
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,560
to help you improve your image

881
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,680
and do something good.

882
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
It's so good.

883
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,440
I didn't expect him to come here.

884
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,240
Okay.

885
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,000
The most important thing is to do good things.

886
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,040
Do good things to help others.

887
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,000
I don't want to

888
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,520
improve my image.

889
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,640
But now we finally

890
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,480
take this kind of film.

891
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,240
What should we do?

892
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,320
Wait a minute.

893
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,000
There will be a chance.

894
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,720
Really.

895
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,760
Are you Miss Jian Xi?

896
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,720
Really?

897
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,840
A De, come here.

898
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,880
A De.

899
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,560
What's up?

900
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,480
We saw you

901
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,600
walking into the public service promotion center.

902
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,200
Are you interested in public service films?

903
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,840
Of course.

904
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,600
We can't come here to shop.

905
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,160
Then you...

906
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,240
Don't ask.

907
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,920
They won't agree to us.

908
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,360
Let's go.

909
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,280
Don't waste time.

910
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,320
You want to see me?

911
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,120
It's okay.

912
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,360
Sorry to bother you.

913
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,560
What okay?

914
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Just try it.

915
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,400
Why did you

916
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,600
refuse so many times?

917
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,720
You just don't give up.

918
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,520
I said it's impossible.

919
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,760
It's impossible.

920
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
You guys say it.

921
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
We want to invite you to play in a film.

922
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,880
A public service film.

923
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,600
Film?

924
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,320
Yes.

925
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
What kind of public service film?

926
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,720
It's our animal protection association's

927
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,240
own public service film.

928
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,040
In order to promote the production of a small cost of caring for dogs,

929
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,680
famous actresses like you

930
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,800
will not participate.

931
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,760
We found a lot of small models.

932
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,360
They don't want to come at all.

933
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,840
So you mean

934
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,400
your protagonist is a dog?

935
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,480
Yes.

936
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,680
You mean

937
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,800
we should be the supporting role for the dog?

938
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,480
Yes.

939
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,760
I don't agree.

940
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,240
Anxi.

941
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,480
Just say it. It's useless.

942
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,400
Let's go.

943
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,920
I'm willing to.

944
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,520
Really?

945
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,200
Really.

946
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,400
Jianxi.

947
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,960
I'm willing to.

948
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,640
Are you crazy?

949
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,720
Are you crazy?

950
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,840
Are you crazy to accept such a film?

951
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,840
Why don't you stop her?

952
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,360
Stop her?

953
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,200
Yes.

954
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,040
Say it.

955
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,440
Say anything.

956
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,840
Jianxi.

957
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,720
Yes.

958
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,640
Dogs are different from humans.

959
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,240
Can you build trust with dogs?

960
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,840
Lu Zhou.

961
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Are you angry with me now?

962
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,560
It's better to have a film than to have no film.

963
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,440
We can't make a small film like this.

964
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,640
Low cost, no publicity,

965
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
the protagonist is a dog.

966
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,360
Film?

967
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,360
It's useless to us.

968
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,760
I don't care about the publicity or the film.

969
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
What do you mean?

970
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,960
Listen.

971
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,840
I accept the film for you

972
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,960
to help you wash away the negative news.

973
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
It's a waste of time

974
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
to accept such a small film.

975
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,560
Anxi.

976
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,160
I've made up my mind.

977
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,080
It's hard to find an actor.

978
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,560
I don't have a film to shoot.

979
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,360
I'm free.

980
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,880
I can practice acting.

981
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,920
The most important thing is to promote

982
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,520
the idea of protecting animals.

983
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,920
It's a great help.

984
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,920
So you mean you're going?

985
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Yes.

986
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,320
Ignore me.

987
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
I want to be alone.

988
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,440
It's a love letter.

989
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
Where?

990
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,160
Love letter.

991
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,040
It's a love letter.

992
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
It's so hard to buy.

993
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,440
Slow down.

994
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
Let's go back.

995
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,760
Ji Qing.

996
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,560
You're always at home.

997
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,680
You finally come out.

998
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,160
Are you going back so soon?

999
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,240
I said I was going back.

1000
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,040
Didn't you hear me?

1001
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,640
Ji Qing.

1002
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,960
Let's go have afternoon tea.

1003
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,240
The one you liked the most.

1004
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,760
Okay?

1005
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Stop talking. Let's go.

1006
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,840
Are you okay, Ji Qing?

1007
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,640
Are you okay?

1008
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,840
I told you not to go upstairs.

1009
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
You hit someone.

1010
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,440
Aren't you Ji Qing?

1011
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,640
What's wrong with you?

1012
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Put it on.

1013
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,240
Stop shooting.

1014
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,640
What's wrong?

1015
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,440
Where is Ji Qing?

1016
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Ji Qing has locked herself in the room.

1017
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,040
Ji Qing, open the door.

1018
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
Ji Qing, open the door.

1019
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Go away.

1020
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,240
Go away.

1021
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,640
The key.

1022
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Hurry up.

1023
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,640
Ji Qing.

1024
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Didn't you promise me to cheer up?

1025
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,240
The clouds are on the flowers,

1026
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,440
but the summer is gone.

1027
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,440
The moonlight shines on the night.

1028
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,040
It's with the loneliness,

1029
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,440
and my heart is full of sadness.

1030
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,640
Watching the flowers bloom,

1031
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,440
watching the loneliness turn into frost.

1032
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,840
Watching the tide rise and fall,

1033
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,440
the cold and cold of the world,

1034
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,840
the sky is dark and the sky is bright.

1035
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,240
Too much hope,

1036
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,240
and in the end, I become desperate.

1037
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
Watching you come and go,

1038
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,640
holding on to the wind and frost,

1039
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,240
everything is in vain.

1040
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,640
Too stubborn,

1041
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,440
but I have to be young and crazy.

1042
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,640
There is absurdity,

1043
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,440
so I don't forget the fire.

1044
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,640
Looking back,

1045
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,840
there will always be regrets.

1046
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,240
You and I,

1047
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,640
we are gradually lost on the road.

1048
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,840
The typhoon is going,

1049
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,840
and we don't think about anything.

1050
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:17,040
Where will the new yellow sea be?

1051
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,240
Just like this,

1052
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,440
waiting for the dawn to come.

1053
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,040
Just like this,

1054
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,640
waiting for the dawn to come.

1055
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,240
Just like this,

1056
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,840
waiting for the dawn to come.
