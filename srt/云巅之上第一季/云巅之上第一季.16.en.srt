1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Miss you

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Love you

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is willing to give you strength

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
At that moment

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
A certain age

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,360
Turned into magical eyes

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,920
Go through the loneliness to find you

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,920
Hold the weapon in your hands

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Use all your power to fight for the most real you

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the little trick

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what rumors

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,120
I will definitely be invincible

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,480
I don't know if you are willing

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,760
Where is the gold?

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:36,480
In the past, I kept this sweet

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,800
No matter where your heart is

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,120
My heart is here

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,240
Even if the iron armor is invincible

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,040
I'm just a you

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:23,680
Translation and Timing performed by

30
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
This is a big news.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,680
I used to be very close to Keruo.

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,680
I thought we could be happy and go on.

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Then we got married.

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,680
But I didn't expect that

35
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,680
my favorite man betrayed me with my best friend.

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Tell us who broke your relationship.

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
I don't want to tell you.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,680
I don't want to tell you anything.

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,680
Is he sick?

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Is he mentally ill?

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
He can't tell such a lie.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Fake news?

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
He went to the hospital.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
The assistant said that the phone was left at the Shen family's house.

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
He happened to run into him.

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
He was sent to the hospital.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,680
No wonder he just showed up at the hospital.

48
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
I understand.

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,680
He just wants everyone to think that

50
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Jianxi took Keruo away.

51
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Then he committed suicide.

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
He made headlines.

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
He's not allowed to sympathize, right?

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
He's a man of his word.

55
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
He did a good job this time.

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,680
He won't let us find any evidence.

57
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Where's Keruo?

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Tell him to come out and clarify the facts.

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
He went abroad to send an MV.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
He went abroad?

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Qi Men Sen personally directed it.

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,680
I guess he was already on the plane

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
before he saw any news.

64
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
Is Qi Men Sen sick?

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Jianxi is not a member of his company.

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
In this situation,

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
we can only be cold-hearted.

68
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Qi Men Sen's suggestion,

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,680
the company's superior also agreed.

70
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Cold-hearted.

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Every time I encounter such a thing, I'm cold-hearted.

72
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
What did they take Jianxi for?

73
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
A gunpowder?

74
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
To block everyone's mouth?

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
If it were like this,

76
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I would take Jianxi and leave.

77
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Stop.

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Are you

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
secretly interacting with some companies?

80
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
That's right.

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,680
The company doesn't value Jianxi.

82
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,680
I helped him seek better development.

83
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,680
This circle is very small.

84
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Any wind, wind, grass, and hole, everyone knows.

85
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
You did this.

86
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
It's too obvious.

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,680
That's Qi Men Sen's betrayal of his faith.

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
If we continue to follow him like this,

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
sooner or later we will be destroyed.

90
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Enough. Stop arguing.

91
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
I'm leaving.

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Where are you going?

93
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,680
I'm going to work.

94
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
You can't go.

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
You will be a target if you go out now.

96
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Before I have a way, you can't go anywhere.

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,680
The scene has called to urge me.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Please leave.

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Anxin,

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
if I stop working like this,

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,680
what's the difference between Shen Yan who relies on rumors and the superior?

102
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
That's not...

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Let him go.

104
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Lu Zhou.

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
He can only choose to face it now.

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
It's meaningless to escape.

107
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
It can only make others feel guilty.

108
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Anxin.

109
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Zhao Chang appears in the film.

110
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
This is the most wise choice.

111
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Okay, let me ask you.

112
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
What about the voices outside?

113
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Those voices have no effect on him.

114
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
The most terrible thing now is...

115
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
What is the most terrible thing?

116
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Jianxi.

117
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Go to film.

118
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,680
Maybe the situation is not as serious as I thought.

119
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
I won't go.

120
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Jianxi really took away Shen Yan's boyfriend.

121
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Don't forget.

122
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
I helped him block that day.

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
I said they had nothing to do.

124
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
It's embarrassing.

125
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Right.

126
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
You were in the news that seduces the director.

127
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Now you want to go out with him.

128
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
That's too much.

129
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Yeah.

130
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
I hate Xiao Sen the most.

131
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Last time I praised her acting.

132
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Now I think about it,

133
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
it's disgusting.

134
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Right.

135
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
He's staying with her.

136
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,640
He's always so down-to-earth.

137
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
He's so stupid.

138
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,240
Isn't he a movie queen?

139
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,680
He's been on all the social media platforms.

140
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,640
He's now

141
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,080
a public movie star.

142
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,480
He's already gone too far.

143
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,040
It's different now.

144
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,480
Who's going to be the next movie star?

145
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,240
Damn it.

146
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,520
It's such a big deal.

147
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,640
I don't think he'll be able to make it again.

148
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Director.

149
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,240
Sorry, we're late.

150
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,480
Who do you think you are?

151
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,640
You're making so many people wait for you.

152
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,840
If you don't want to act,

153
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,160
don't have to agree.

154
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,200
I told you

155
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,320
that you can't be late.

156
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,880
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

157
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,840
Sorry, director.

158
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,920
We were stopped by the reporters.

159
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,400
That's why we're late.

160
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,680
I don't want to listen to your excuses.

161
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't want to interfere with your disputes.

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,520
The most important thing here

163
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,880
is to act well.

164
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,800
I understand.

165
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,680
I'm really sorry.

166
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
What are you waiting for?

167
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
Get your makeup done.

168
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,640
Okay.

169
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,720
Don't worry. Let's go.

170
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Jingxi.

171
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Jingxi.

172
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
You can do it.

173
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
You can do it.

174
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Thank you.

175
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Go.

176
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Jingxi.

177
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Director is rushing us.

178
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Okay, I'll be right there.

179
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Okay.

180
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Okay.

181
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Thank you.

182
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Let's go.

183
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Okay.

184
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Jingxi, your makeup bag.

185
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Put it here.

186
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
I'll come and get it after I finish my work.

187
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Okay.

188
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Thank you.

189
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Let's go.

190
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
I'll go over and change.

191

You deserve to die.

200
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
You deserve to die.

201
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Why didn't you hit him hard?

202
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
You wanted to help him, didn't you?

203
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Okay.

204
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Then you two fight each other.

205
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,480
You can't stop or die.

206
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
You two hit me hard.

207
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Master.

208
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
You're so stupid.

209
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
You deserve to die.

210
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
You deserve to die.

211
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
You deserve to die.

212
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Master.

213
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Calm down.

214
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Don't be angry with these servants.

215
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Master.

216
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Stop fighting.

217
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
The good people are going to be beaten.

218
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Master, don't you like to watch western dance?

219
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
I'll show you.

220
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
What's wrong?

221
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Nothing.

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Master.

223
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Miss Wu said she wanted to watch western dance.

224
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Then dance.

225
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Hurry up.

226
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Jianxi is so good.

227
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
She's so innocent.

228
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
She's a professional actress.

229
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
But she did that thing.

230
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
She's so bad.

231
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
She's so good at contrasting.

232
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
She's a double-faced person.

233
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
What kind of person is a double-faced person?

234
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,480
The most basic thing for an actor is to play a good show, right?

277
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480

286
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,660

You're right

293
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,000

297
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,620

You two must capture your emotion accurately.

300
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,720
After her beloved Zhenfei died,

301
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
it's like she was iniliary and couldn't Cole slipped freely.

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,420
Rong Ling's emergence right now,

303
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
for her is a novel.

304
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,660
She is like the last light I see,

305
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,920
being foreign to dark palace.

306
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,460
Is it understood?

307
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,460
I'll take two shots.

308
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,060
I'll send you back after the shoot.

309
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,860
Okay.

310
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,940
By the way,

311
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
I happen to need some.

312
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,020
I've been so dry lately.

313
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
Then this is a moisturizing cream.

314
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,020
Is it?

315
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,180
How is it?

316
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,140
Not bad.

317
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,340
I feel a little itchy.

318
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,540
What's wrong?

319
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,580
No, I feel itchy.

320
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,420
Why?

321
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,540
What's this?

322
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,420
This...

323
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,500
It's a moisturizing cream.

324
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
What's this smell?

325
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,220
What's in it?

326
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,940
No, no.

327
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,860
Are you okay?

328
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,380
I don't know.

329
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,540
It's a retribution.

330
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,580
It's a pity that he didn't take the blame.

331
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,300
What did you say?

332
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,100
I said it's a retribution.

333
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,140
Can't you hear me?

334
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,140
Did you two do it?

335
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,580
I'm not that idle.

336
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,460
I think

337
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,660
it's the God's will to judge someone's misdeeds.

338
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,380
He wants to teach us a lesson.

339
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,820
What did you add to my moisturizing cream?

340
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,700
It has nothing to do with me.

341
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,980
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

342
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,580
I'll sue you for defamation.

343
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,140
What do you mean?

344
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,180
What are you doing?

345
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,820
How dare you hit me?

346
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,860
You bitch.

347
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,380
Zuo Zuo.

348
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,780
I'll hit you.

349
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,340
Zuo Zuo.

350
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,980
Stop it.

351
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,620
Stop it.

352
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:16,980
Stop it.

353
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,820
Stop it.

354
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,380
Zuo Zuo.

355
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,100
Get lost.

356
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,580
My face is itchy.

357
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,540
Let's go to the hospital.

358
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,980
Where are you going?

359
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,340
I'm going back.

360
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,540
Let's go together.

361
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,140
No.

362
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,100
My face is itchy.

363
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,740
I'll go and have a look.

364
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,180
You're still laughing.

365
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,540
It's so funny.

366
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,260
It's itchy.

367
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,220
Stop it.

368
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,340
If you keep laughing,

369
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,540
you'll have a scar on your face.

370
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,300
It's really itchy.

371
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,940
What did they put in there?

372
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,380
They did it for me.

373
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,260
I'm sorry.

374
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,820
I got you this time.

375
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,180
It's not your fault.

376
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,660
If you want to blame,

377
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,300
blame those people.

378
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,980
They're so bad.

379
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,620
You're really annoying me.

380
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,740
Stop it.

381
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,340
Don't you understand?

382
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,420
What?

383
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Those people

384
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,500
are here to help Shen Yan.

385
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,140
Why is it him again?

386
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,140
If I get a scar on my face tomorrow,

387
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,740
I'll

388
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,180
tear their face.

389
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,580
Zuo Zuo.

390
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,780
Don't be angry at me.

391
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,740
Who's angry at you?

392
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,900
I don't like them.

393
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,460
You crazy people.

394
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,700
You and I

395
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,100
are like crazy people.

396
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,540
And you.

397
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,740
You two are crazy.

398
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,780
I'm fine.

399
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,500
You're actually sexy.

400
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,180
Zuo Zuo.

401
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,300
This is the second time you've helped me.

402
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,940
Thank you.

403
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,300
You're so silly.

404
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,180
I've hurt you so many times.

405
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,860
You just remember that I helped you.

406
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,180
Who said that?

407
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,420
I remember

408
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,580
all the previous debts.

409
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,900
But

410
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,660
seeing you

411
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
now, you're already crazy.

412
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,860
Let's settle it.

413
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,820
It really hurts.

414
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,580
Let's go.

415
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,300
Why didn't you return the mirror?

416
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
He gave it to me.

417
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,140
Zuo Zuo.

418
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,580
Why did you come back so late?

419
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,900
Why are you hurt?

420
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
It hurts.

421
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,220
It hurts.

422
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,420
Did you fight with someone again?

423
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,980
I didn't fight with anyone.

424
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,900
What's in your head?

425
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,460
You always make trouble.

426
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,300
Zuo Zuo.

427
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,900
Did you fight with Jian Xi?

428
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,460
I didn't fight with Jian Xi.

429
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,620
I just taught

430
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,940
some people I hate.

431
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,420
You just said no.

432
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,100
I will tell you about that too.

433
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,660
I must confess now.

434
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,620
Hey.

435
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,820
I'm starving to death.

436
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,620
How much trouble are you going to cause

437
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,780
that you haven't lncnelle tap?

438
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,460
Is the other guy aware of the past matters of Dian Xi?

439
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
That person?

440
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Writer Zhan Mei.

441
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
He's in such a big trouble.

442
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,660
How could he not know?

443
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,020
He's really a man of heart.

444
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,060
Why are you so concerned about

445
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,100
the thing with Jianxi?

446
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,020
Who said I was worried about Jianxi?

447
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,220
I wish

448
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,420
he would get out of the university.

449
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,340
Really?

450
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,500
Of course.

451
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,860
I hate him so much.

452
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,940
Then why did you help him?

453
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,780
If you mention this again,

454
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,980
I'll turn against you.

455
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,300
I'm sorry.

456
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,220
You can't take my granddaughter.

457
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,100
She's my daughter.

458
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,140
I can't raise her.

459
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,740
Who said I can't raise her?

460
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,260
I must take her away today.

461
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,500
You're not a good mother.

462
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
You're never a good mother.

463
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,940
I'll be a good mother.

464
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,700
I'll take good care of her.

465
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,380
Give her back to me.

466
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,900
You have to pursue your dream.

467
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,500
Go ahead.

468
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,420
I won't stop you.

469
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,340
But my granddaughter

470
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,260
can't live a peaceful life

471
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,700
with you.

472
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,780
You'll have a new family in the future.

473
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,940
You'll be very tired with her.

474
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,140
The child won't be happy.

475
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,380
Please forget her.

476
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,780
No.

477
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,540
I want my daughter.

478
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,980
Jiang Qian Yi.

479
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,040
Take care of yourself.

480
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,300
Director.

481
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,020
Can I cheat you

482
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,300
with the sentence

483
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,820
knight taught the bow water.

484
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,100
Hold on.

485
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,620
You heard it...

486
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,100
Jie Xin.

487
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,220
I just gotten the news.

488
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,380
After discussion with the investment company,

489
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,540
we've removed Rong Ling from the job.

490
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,940
Her character, any character is fine.

491
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,940
Even the supporting role, even a word is fine.

492
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,140
I know you are a very professional actress.

493
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,540
I also admire you very much.

494
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,140
But this time, the situation is different.

495
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,540
Jinxi, please give me the script.

496
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,940
Why?

497
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,540
Why is it like this?

498
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,540
You said that no matter what happens outside,

499
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,740
you won't change me.

500
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,740
Just because of those rumors,

501
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
you have to deny everything I did?

502
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,740
You will know this sooner or later.

503
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,540
Then I will tell you now.

504
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,340
From now on,

505
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,740
no one will ask you to act.

506
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Why is that?

507
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,940
The acting association issued a notice.

508
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,940
To save all the film companies,

509
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,940
no more acting.

510
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
You are too much.

511
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,940
You are too much.

512
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,940
What is the acting association?

513
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Simply put,

514
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,340
it is not an official organization.

515
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,140
But its founders are all first-tier directors

516
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,340
and some famous acting companies' directors.

517
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,140
So, it is quite influential.

518
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,540
But don't they usually not interfere in these things?

519
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
What happened today?

520
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,540
Because they received a lot of complaints from the audience of the audition.

521
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,740
They said that the audition was bad.

522
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,540
It seriously affected the industry's performance.

523
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,740
They said that the audition was bad.

524
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,340
They said that the audition was bad.

525
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,140
It seriously affected the industry's performance.

526
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,140
So, they asked to stop all the acting activities immediately.

527
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Why are there so many messages from the audience?

528
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,540
Yes.

529
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,540
It must be planned by Shen Yanquan.

530
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,540
The pressure of the public didn't drive me away.

531
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,540
So he forced me to leave in this way.

532
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Is there any way to explain to them?

533
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,540
You are too naive.

534
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,340
There is no evidence.

535
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,540
Moreover, the scandal is getting worse.

536
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,540
Do you think the acting association will believe it?

537
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,140
In this case,

538
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,140
we can't participate in all the activities?

539
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,140
Of course.

540
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,340
It's been a long time to gather the popularity.

541
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,340
It seems to be successful.

542
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,740
So, what should we do now?

543
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,340
The audience is a hope.

544
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,740
As long as you don't come out for half a year,

545
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,740
they will forget who you are.

546
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,340
Jianxi.

547
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,140
I'm fine.

548
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,940
Today, the work of the audition should be canceled, right?

549
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,940
Yes.

550
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,540
I'm going back.

551
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,940
Let me send you back.

552
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,140
Anxin.

553
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,140
I have something to tell you.

554
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,140
I'll go back by myself.

555
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,940
Be careful on the way.

556
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,940
What's wrong?

557
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,540
Let her face it herself.

558
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,740
If all the things are to be faced by the actors,

559
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,540
why do we, the economic people, have to do it?

560
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,740
I have something more important to tell you.

561
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,940
The weather is really good today.

562
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Why do you look so pale?

563
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Are you in a bad mood?

564
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,140
Does it hurt when you cut the blade?

565
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
It hurts.

566
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
Why not?

567
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,940
To defeat me,

568
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,940
you are so cruel to yourself.

569
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,340
Is it worth it?

570
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,340
The feeling of approaching death

571
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,540
is really painful.

572
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,140
But I want to see you

573
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,140
going to the peak step by step.

574
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,740
I will feel more painful.

575
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,140
I'd rather bear the pain of a moment

576
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
than compare the two.

577
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,140
I also want to pull you down

578
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,940
by myself.

579
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,940
You are really good at acting.

580
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
But I won't follow your script.

581
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,940
Haven't you realized the reality yet?

582
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,340
Once you are expelled by the acting association,

583
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,940
you will never be able to perform again.

584
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,740
I still advise you

585
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,540
to take on the burden and leave.

586
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,540
Don't waste your time.

587
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,540
You won't give up acting.

588
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,740
Never.

589
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,140
Very good.

590
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,940
Then I will watch you struggle in the swamp.

591
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,940
And I

592
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,340
will become the most dazzling

593
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,340
and the most eye-catching female star.

594
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,540
Do you think you can get Rong Ling

595
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,940
if you defeat me?

596
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,340
Of course.

597
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
You are so pitiful.

598
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,740
You are the one who is pitiful.

599
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,540
You imitated my performance

600
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
when I first played the piano, right?

601
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
Because of your excellent playing skills

602
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,740
and my performance demonstration,

603
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,940
you can successfully replace me with a song.

604
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
But this time,

605
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,340
I only played a few scenes.

606
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,740
How do you plan to capture the future Rong Ling?

607
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,940
I am really curious.

608
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
What do you mean?

609
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,540
As an actress,

610
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,940
improving your acting skills is the most important thing.

611
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,740
Color and luck can only make you get the role.

612
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,340
But you can't get everyone's approval.

613
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,340
You put all your efforts

614
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,340
on your opponent.

615
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
But your performance

616
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,740
didn't make any progress.

617
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
You are the most pitiful

618
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,740
when you try to play Rong Ling.

619
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,940
I will definitely lose.

620
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,740
You'd better hold on to your part first.

621
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
Shen Yan's part should not be taken.

622
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,740
Director, director.

623
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,540
I am coming.

624
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,940
Thank you for giving me this chance.

625
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,340
Thank you for giving me this chance.

626
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,340
Thank you.

627
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,740
Then you can play

628
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,140
the part where Rong Ling danced.

629
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,940
Okay.

630
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,740
Okay.

631
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Enough.

632
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,540
Director,

633
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,540
I won't be her partner.

634
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,140
Ji Qing,

635
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,140
why don't you be my partner?

636
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
It's too bad.

637
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,740
Your performance is too bad.

638
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,140
This is not fair.

639
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,540
You can't say that

640
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,140
because you hate me.

641
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,140
Don't make fun of me.

642
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,340
I am not your partner.

643
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,940
I am your partner.

644
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,340
I am your partner.

645
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,340
I am your partner.

646
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,540
I am your partner.

647
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
I am your partner.

648
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,340
Don't make fun of me.

649
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,940
Ji Qing is not that kind of person.

650
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,340
Why is that?

651
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,740
Jian Xi is now famous.

652
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,740
I am more suitable than her.

653
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,140
Rong Ling is an excellent dancer

654
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,740
from the famous dancer Deng Ken.

655
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,940
What did you just dance?

656
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Modern dance.

657
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,540
I have taught the teacher

658
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,940
and studied it seriously.

659
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Studied?

660
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
I have been practicing these two days.

661
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,340
I have done my best.

662
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,340
Do you think you can play Rong Ling

663
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,540
with these two days?

664
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,340
Rong Ling learned modern dance from Deng Ken.

665
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,140
I have danced it like a mother.

666
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,340
What's wrong with that?

667
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,940
Only modern dance?

668
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,140
Yes.

669
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,540
Have you read the script seriously?

670
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,140
Not only that.

671
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,140
I have memorized it all at once.

672
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,140
Then you should know

673
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,540
after Rong Ling performed the ballet dance for the first time,

674
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,740
Cixi let her perform the Eastern dance.

675
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,140
Cixi held a small party.

676
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,940
Just on that party,

677
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,940
Rong Ling performed Spanish dance,

678
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Chinese dance,

679
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,340
and Greek classical dance.

680
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,140
Not to mention that she put the Western dance

681
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,540
in the lotus dance and the Ruyi dance.

682
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,140
Have you learned all these?

683
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,340
You just danced the modern dance of the West.

684
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,340
Director, give me some more time.

685
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,940
I can learn everything.

686
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,540
Your performance just now

687
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,540
proves that you have not studied the script seriously.

688
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,140
Not to mention studying history.

689
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,740
I will study it.

690
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
I was just...

691
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,140
Since you got the script,

692
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,740
I will use all my heart

693
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,940
to study this role.

694
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,340
You are biased.

695
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,140
The dance of the Second Class,

696
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,340
the Three-character dance,

697
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,340
the Mongolian dance,

698
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,340
the Annam dance,

699
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
the Burmese dance.

700
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,740
Have you heard of all these?

701
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,140
These are common dance of the Palace.

702
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,340
As the first female official of Cixi,

703
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,340
and the first modern dance of China,

704
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,940
it's ridiculous that you haven't heard of all these.

705
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,540
Director, I...

706
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,740
Director, I won't cooperate with her.

707
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,740
If you insist on using such a half-baked actor,

708
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,540
I can only say no.

709
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,340
Director, it's too late to change the actor.

710
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,940
I am the most suitable candidate.

711
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,540
Stop shooting.

712
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,540
Until I find the real Rong Ming.

713
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,340
Director.

714
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,140
You...

715
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
Ji Qing.

716
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,140
Why do you care who plays Rong Ling?

717
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,540
It has nothing to do with you.

718
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
Nothing?

719
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
Of course.

720
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,740
I am right.

721
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
The worse Shen Yan plays,

722
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,140
the better for you.

723
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,540
Isn't it good?

724
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,740
Xiang Xiang.

725
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,340
I am right.

726
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,140
Do you do this

727
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,540
because you sympathize with Jian Xi?

728
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,940
Do you think one person

729
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,540
can make a play?

730
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
It's hard to be a single person.

731
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
No matter how good I play,

732
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,540
I can't make a play.

733
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,540
And don't forget,

734
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,140
the name of this play is

735
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
De Ling Yu Rong Ling.

736
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,140
Alright.

737
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
You don't understand.

738
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,340
Let's go.

739
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,140
There are activities.

740
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,340
Let's go.

741
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,740
Tell me.

742
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,340
What do you want to do?

743
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,140
I want to be an actor.

744
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,140
I can't hear you clearly.

745
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,140
I want to be an actor.

746
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
Jian Xi.

747
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Be greedy.

748
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,540
Don't think about those things.

749
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
At worst,

750
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,940
we won't act.

751
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,940
No matter what,

752
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,740
I won't give up acting.

753
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,940
Why did you choose to act?

754
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,940
Because I like it.

755
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,140
I like it.

756
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,140
I like it.

757
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,740
I want to pursue my dream.

758
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,740
And I want to share this feeling

759
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,140
with everyone.

760
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,540
So that everyone can feel happy.

761
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Move back a little.

762
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,140
Alright.

763
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,540
I'll stand in the light.

764
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,940
Move back a little.

765
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,740
Move back a little.

766
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,540
Is it here?

767
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,540
Is it okay?

768
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,140
Let me see.

769
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,140
Is it okay?

770
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,940
It's okay.

771
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,340
How long will it take?

772
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,540
Let me ask.

773
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
Hello.

774
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
Did you cry?

775
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
No.

776
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,340
I'm strong.

777
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
I'll go to see you.

778
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
No need.

779
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,540
Your schedule is full.

780
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,740
Don't go anywhere.

781
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
It's okay.

782
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,340
I'll go to see you after work.

783
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,740
You don't have to bother.

784
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,940
I can do it myself.

785
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,740
I want to borrow your phone.

786
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,940
How about this?

787
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,340
I'll call you after I get the job and stay at home.

788
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
Sorry, director.

789
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,540
I'm late.

790
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,540
It's okay.

791
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
The time is just right.

792
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,740
Let's start shooting now.

793
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,340
Okay?

794
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,540
Sorry.

795
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,340
It's okay.

796
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
Don't look at me like that.

797
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
I just knew it.

798
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,140
The actress who ordered the star's ad,

799
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,940
the female lead,

800
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
has become Shen Yan.

801
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,740
Tang Fei.

802
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,740
Can we start shooting?

803
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,940
Okay, two people get closer.

804
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,140
Okay.

805
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,940
Please be closer.

806
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,140
Come on.

807
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,540
Okay.

808
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,340
Okay.

809
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,740
Please pay attention.

810
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,140
You are now a couple

811
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,340
who protect each other

812
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,140
and share sweet happiness.

813
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
Yes.

814
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,940
Come on.

815
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,740
Okay.

816
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,540
Perfect.

817
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,940
Shen Yan.

818
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,740
Look at you.

819
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,940
You can't do it if you don't like it.

820
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,940
You are too much.

821
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,340
Mr. Yue.

822
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,740
I need you to sign here.

823
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,740
I'll be right back.

824
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
You go first.

825
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,340
You can see it again.

826
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,740
You can sign it if you have no problem.

827
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,740
Is it here?

828
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,340
Fei.

829
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,140
Just sign it.

830
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,140
I think

831
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,340
the photos we took just now

832
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
are too plain.

833
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,540
They are not like close couples.

834
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,540
Can we shoot again?

835
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
I think it's great.

836
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
I know

837
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,740
you have been misunderstanding me.

838
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,140
If it goes on like this,

839
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,940
there is no way to work normally.

840
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,740
Can you give me two minutes

841
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,740
to explain it to you?

842
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,540
Go ahead.

843
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,740
I know I did a lot of bad things.

844
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,140
It's normal that you hate me.

845
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,540
But

846
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,740
everyone has a different position.

847
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,340
The angle of view is different.

848
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,740
I'm the same as Jian Xi.

849
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,340
No.

850
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,940
I'm worse than her.

851
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,340
She is talented in acting.

852
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,940
Lu Zhou is so proud of her.

853
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,940
She gave her countless chances.

854
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,340
What about me?

855
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,940
I have nothing.

856
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,340
I only have myself.

857
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,740
This circle looks very grand.

858
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,940
In fact,

859
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,540
it's cruel.

860
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,340
If I'm not famous,

861
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,940
I will be trampled by others.

862
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,140
I don't want to be like this.

863
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,140
It's been so many years.

864
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,940
You are also trampling on others' shoulders.

865
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,540
You have been walking slowly until today.

866
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,340
My behavior is very despicable.

867
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,740
That's because I chose a

868
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,740
difficult path.

869
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,140
I feel worse than others.

870
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,540
Others don't understand.

871
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,940
I think you should understand me.

872
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
So?

873
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,140
So

874
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,140
please don't hate me anymore.

875
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,540
Can you

876
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,140
think from my perspective?

877
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,740
I don't want to be so bad.

878
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,540
And

879
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,940
I hate Jian Xi because he...

880
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,340
Because you are miserable.

881
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,940
You have been emphasizing that you are miserable.

882
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,940
Your purpose is to win my sympathy.

883
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,540
The first step.

884
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,340
What first step?

885
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,540
And then?

886
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,340
You will say that you have been supporting me.

887
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,540
You want to hurt Jian Xi

888
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,140
because you want to get me.

889
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,740
The second step.

890
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
And then?

891
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
You will show your evil tricks.

892
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,340
I will be crazy to fall for you

893
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,740
and then dump Jian Xi.

894
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,340
This is your third step.

895
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,740
Fei, what are you talking about?

896
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,740
I don't understand.

897
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,340
You are using these three steps to cause chaos.

898
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,340
But your method is not smart.

899
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,340
It's because Kelo's way of doing things is not smart.

900
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
You are right.

901
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,340
I have lived a life of the bottom.

902
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,740
I didn't have a penny.

903
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,940
I made a dance for others.

904
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,940
I know very well

905
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,740
what it is like to climb up from the bottom.

906
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
But even so,

907
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,940
it still can't stop me from hating you.

908
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,740
If you tell me the truth,

909
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,740
you want fame,

910
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,740
you want power,

911
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,340
you want the first place,

912
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,740
you want to take everything.

913
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
Maybe I will admire your courage.

914
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,540
But you are not.

915
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,140
You have done so many bad things.

916
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,940
You still want a good reputation.

917
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,540
God is fair.

918
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,340
It's impossible for him to have everything.

919
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,940
God gave you a good leader.

920
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,740
But I think

921
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,140
you didn't learn to cherish him.

922
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,740
Wait.

923
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,140
I know what you want to say.

924
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,940
You did so much

925
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,140
just to make Jansy lose everything.

926
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,940
But I also tell you,

927
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,540
even if I lose everything,

928
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,140
I will protect Jansy.

929
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,740
Do you understand?

930
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,940
Kelo, let's go.

931
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
Wait for me to get my bag.

932
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,940
Tang Fei.

933
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
Tang Fei.

934
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,340
Why are you laughing?

935
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,540
I think you are too straightforward.

936
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,940
Compared to what he did to Jansy,

937
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,340
I think I am already gentle enough.

938
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,540
We talked about this last time, right?

939
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,540
Look.

940
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
Change it like this.

941
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,340
I was just about to tell you.

942
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,140
Zuo, what are you looking for?

943
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,740
I am looking for the news.

944
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,140
What news?

945
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,340
Jansy's news.

946
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,340
How could this happen?

947
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,140
It's so strange.

948
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,340
How could there be nothing

949
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,740
in the whole night?

950
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,940
What if you are talking about those scandals?

951
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,740
Dad, do you know anything?

952
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,340
Uncle Zhu, you are the director of the acting association.

953
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,340
Do you know

954
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,140
anything about this?

955
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
I only know

956
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,340
that any actor

957
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,140
should be removed from the acting association.

958
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Those media will

959
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,740
stop reporting to him

960
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,540
at the same time.

961
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,740
This is bad.

962
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,540
Why is it bad?

963
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,940
For an actor,

964
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,540
it is necessary to keep the exposure.

965
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,140
Jansy was attacked by the media before.

966
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,740
Although there are many negative images,

967
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,340
it also increases his popularity.

968
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,940
It seems to be like this.

969
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Then this time...

970
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,940
He can't shoot a play.

971
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,140
He can't be on the news.

972
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,940
No one knows his news.

973
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,140
This is more terrible than a sandstorm.

974
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,940
What should we do?

975
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:03,940
Dad.

976
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,740
I remember that you always

977
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,140
hate Jansy.

978
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,340
Why are you suddenly

979
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,740
worried about him?

980
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,540
I...

981
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,740
Who is worried about Jansy?

982
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,740
I...

983
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,340
I don't want Shen Yan to be too arrogant.

984
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Shen Yan made this happen.

985
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,540
Dad, you are the director of the acting association.

986
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,940
You must have a way, right?

987
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,340
This time,

988
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,940
because the situation is too big,

989
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,340
Kang Yixin

990
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,940
flew over like snowflakes.

991
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,940
The acting association made such a decision.

992
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,540
It's also a pressure to the public.

993
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,340
What pressure?

994
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,140
I'm asking you to help me.

995
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,340
Zuo Zuo, don't make it hard for uncle.

996
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
Forget it. I won't talk to you.

997
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,540
Come on.

998
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,540
Zuo Zuo.

999
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,340
I just made some fruit. Have some.

1000
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,140
I can't stand this outsider anymore.

1001
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,540
You are still in the mood to eat fruit.

1002
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,540
I admire you so much.

1003
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,340
Zuo Zuo.

1004
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,140
Aunt.

1005
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,740
Don't be angry with Zuo Zuo.

1006
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,340
She is too willful.

1007
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,340
It's okay.

1008
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,340
I'll go upstairs.

1009
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,140
Aunt.

1010
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,740
Don't worry.

1011
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,340
I'm not angry with Zuo Zuo.

1012
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,740
Then you...

1013
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,740
Xiao Nian has a cold.

1014
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,940
He has a fever.

1015
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,540
I'm going upstairs to take care of him.

1016
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,940
I'll go with you to see him.

1017
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,540
No need.

1018
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,940
Your shop is about to open soon.

1019
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,940
You can go ahead.

1020
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
I can do it alone.

1021
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,340
Uncle.

1022
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,740
This time, I'll remind you.

1023
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,540
I'm telling you.

1024
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,140
Don't mention her in front of auntie.

1025
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,140
Okay.

1026
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,740
Come on. Let's continue.

1027
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,340
I told you I'm fine.

1028
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,540
Why did you come to me

1029
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,540
when you were late for work?

1030
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,740
I'm fine, too.

1031
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,740
I'm done.

1032
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,340
Why are you lying?

1033
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,740
I know.

1034
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,740
You've been working very hard lately.

1035
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,940
You have to work until dawn every day.

1036
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,340
Okay.

1037
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,740
Let's go.

1038
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,140
Where?

1039
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,540
You'll know when you come with me.

1040
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:05,940
Hmm?

1041
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,740
There are many fun things here.

1042
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,740
Cao Fei.

1043
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,540
Let's play that.

1044
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,140
Okay.

1045
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,740
Again.

1046
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,740
I'll go with you.

1047
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,540
Okay.

1048
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:06,940
Let's go.

1049
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,340
Okay.

1050
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,940
Let's go.

1051
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,940
Okay.

1052
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,340
Let's go.

1053
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:09,740
Let's go.

1054
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,140
Let's go.

1055
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,740
Let's go.

1056
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,540
Let's go.

1057
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:12,940
Let's go.

1058
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,540
Let's go.

1059
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,340
Let's go.

1060
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,140
Let's go.

1061
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,740
Let's go.

1062
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,340
Let's go.

1063
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:27,940
Jian Xin.

1064
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,940
I met Shen Yan today.

1065
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,740
You're both shooting an advertisement?

1066
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,820
Sometimes I think that

1067
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,220
I and he are actually one kind of people.

1068
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,860
Why do you say that about yourself?

1069
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,180
Sometimes I will do everything

1070
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,020
to steal other people's roles for money.

1071
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,540
I will also pretend to be very gentle and gentleman for money.

1072
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,500
And sometimes, like you said,

1073
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,940
selfish, petty, and cruel.

1074
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,500
That's the essence of me.

1075
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,980
Hua,

1076
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,420
you're right.

1077
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,020
But...

1078
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,740
Do you know that

1079
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,220
when I first met you,

1080
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,620
I really thought you were very stupid.

1081
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,580
But it's because of your stupidness

1082
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,580
that I found a lot of things

1083
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,980
that I lost before.

1084
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,260
And sometimes,

1085
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,340
I found out

1086
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,500
that I'm not really like that.

1087
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,980
So,

1088
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,340
you should thank me.

1089
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,980
Then don't be too proud.

1090
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,660
Actually,

1091
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,740
you are different from Shen Yan.

1092
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,860
You are doing this for money,

1093
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,060
but you are doing this for your aunt.

1094
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,340
Because life is hard,

1095
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,660
you need so much money.

1096
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,060
Only when you have money

1097
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,820
can you live a happy life.

1098
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,820
I'm glad you understand.

1099
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,420
But do you know that

1100
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,580
if I didn't meet you,

1101
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,660
things would be worse?

1102
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,500
But you met me now.

1103
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,580
So, there is no if.

1104
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,980
So, you are my lucky star?

1105
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,580
Kiss me.

1106
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,180
No, it's not good.

1107
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,980
Kiss me.

1108
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,620
No.

1109
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,020
Kiss me.

1110
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,820
So many people.

1111
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,180
Where is the wheel?

1112
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,460
Look.

1113
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,700
There are two people in the car.

1114
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,820
They will be there tomorrow.

1115
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,780
Alright.

1116
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,260
Why are you so nervous?

1117
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,340
Let's go down first.

1118
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:31,520
English

1119
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:07,060
With this loneliness, I sing with my heart

1120
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:14,260
See the prosperity and prosperity, see loneliness and sadness

1121
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:20,660
See the tide rise and fall, the people are cold and warm, the sky is dark and the sky is bright

1122
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,260
There are too many expectations, in the end, there is despair

1123
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:33,060
See you come and go, hug the wind and frost, all are flustered

1124
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:39,060
Too stubborn, but still young and crazy

1125
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:45,060
There is absurdity, don't forget the fire

1126
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:51,060
Looking back, there will be grudges and regrets

1127
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:57,060
You and I, we are gradually lost on the road

1128
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:04,060
The sea is crazy, don't think about anything

1129
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:10,060
Where to pretend to be angry?

1130
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:16,060
Just like this, wait for a person until dawn

1131
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:21,060
Just like this, wait for a person until dawn

1132
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:28,060
Just like this, wait for a person until dawn
