1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,960
Look at me with strange eyes

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,840
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't want

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't care who is willing to give you strength

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, in the second year

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will turn into a magical eye

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,800
Pass through the loneliness to find you

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,280
Put on the most solid gold armor

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,800
The weapon in your hands

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,680
Use all your strength to fight against the most real you

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,360
No matter what the little tricks

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what rumors

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,720
I will definitely do it

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,960
The world is invincible

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't want you to be willing

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,320
In the past, I kept the sweetness

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,600
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
My heart is here

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
Even if the world is invincible

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,760
I only have you

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Episode 16

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,200
What are you doing?

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Miss, don't blame me

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Someone spent money to ruin your face

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,880
Help

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,960
Help

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Why don't you cook? I'm hungry

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Haven't you seen a man fight?

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Be careful

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Are you coming?

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
Are you going to fight?

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
Go

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,040
Come back

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
You can't go

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Who sent you here?

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,080
Say it

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
I drank too much

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
I don't like him

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,200
Drunk too much?

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Do you think I'm stupid?

47
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Do you have hair glue?

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Don't smell

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Get off

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
After you arrive at the police station

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,000
Do you want me to sue you for not following the law?

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,200
Or sue you for being a thief?

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,160
These two crimes are much more serious than drinking

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,160
That woman with a hat and glasses

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
I can't see clearly

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
She found me outside the bar

57
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,360
Ok

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Get out

59
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Are you hurt?

60
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
How dare you say that?

61
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
What are you doing outside?

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
You can't let Anxin stay with you

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
She is your agent

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Anxin is sick

65
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I only have one person to call

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Who?

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
You?

68
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Get in

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
I'm here

70
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Can you drive?

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
No

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Then stay in the car

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Don't go anywhere

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Are they here to find revenge?

75
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Don't go down

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Mr. Tang

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Someone wants to see you

78
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Who are you?

79
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Be careful, I'm calling the police

80
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Miss, we don't want to use violence

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Please don't act recklessly

82
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Tang Fei

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
This has nothing to do with him

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Mr. Tang, I'm sorry

85
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
If you let this lady go now

86
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
You will run away

87
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
So please come with us

88
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Let me go

89
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Please hand over your phone

90
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Sorry for you

91
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Why did you get out of the car?

92
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
I was worried about you

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
If you hadn't just saved me

94
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
I wouldn't have worried about you

95
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Now is the consequence of you getting out of the car

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
If you don't get out of the car

97
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
You will fight them alone

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
They will catch you

99
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
At least I have you now

100
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Can you two keep quiet?

101
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Ruan Wanzi

102
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Why are you here?

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Yue Le, did you see Xianxi?

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
No

105
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
I can't find her

106
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
When did you start to lose contact with her?

107
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
After I went back last night

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
I wanted to call her

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
But I fell asleep after taking the medicine

110
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
No one answered the phone today

111
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
I knocked on the door and no one opened

112
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Why did she disappear?

113
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Disappear? Who else disappeared?

114
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I don't know

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Who else disappeared?

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
No way

117
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Who disappeared?

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
I tell you, Tang Fei didn't come back since last night

119
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
You mean

120
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
They are together

121
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
I mean

122
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
How could she forget about today's meeting?

123
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
What should we do now?

124
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Go to the company

125
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Wait

126
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
I will send you there

127
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
I

128
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
I will do it myself

129
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Ok

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I told you

131
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
You will come

132
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Who are you?

133
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
You will be jailed if you don't know I am a police

134
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
There is no law in this world

135
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
That can punish me

136
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Because father asked his son to investigate

137
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
What can I do?

138
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
He is your son

139
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
He is my son

140
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
My son

141
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Can you stop talking nonsense?

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
When did I become your son?

143
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Brother, you are going too far

144
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Apologize to your father

145
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
That's your father

146
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Ok

147
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Sit down

148
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Thank you

149
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
I tell you the truth

150
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
I have been diagnosed

151
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
I have checked

152
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
At most

153
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Six months

154
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
I always thought

155
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
I have nothing to do with

156
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
The disease

157
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
But life is life

158
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
It is always more rich than those movies

159
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
I know

160
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
If I tell you

161
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
You will think

162
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
This is retribution

163
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Since you know

164
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
You don't need me to tell you

165
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Yes

166
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
This is retribution

167
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I can't escape

168
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
So

169
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
I want to die

170
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Before I die

171
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
I want to ask for your forgiveness

172
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
What do you want to ask for?

173
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Yes

174
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I am sorry to you and Jiayu

175
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
For so many years

176
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
I didn't say sorry to you

177
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
For so many years

178
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
But now I want you to know

179
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
I feel very regretful

180
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
About this

181
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I am a person

182
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Who stepped into the coffin

183
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Can't you

184
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Forgive me

185
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
For the sake of father and son?

186
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Impossible

187
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Why are you crying?

188
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
What is there to cry?

189
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
I have told you

190
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
I have signed the divorce papers

191
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
You have to sign

192
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Don't think you gave me a son

193
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
I will live with you forever

194
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Are you deaf or dumb?

195
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Why don't you talk?

196
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Why are you touching me?

197
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
I will beat you to death

198
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
I will beat you to death

199
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
I will beat you to death

200
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
I will beat you to death

201
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
I will beat you to death

202
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Calm down

203
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
The child is still here

204
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
You have to divorce today

205
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I beg you

206
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Don't divorce

207
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
You promised me

208
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
You will be good to us forever

209
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
I promised you

210
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
I will give you happiness

211
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
I have given you the happiness of the previous half of my life

212
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
I have to find the happiness of the next half of my life

213
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
I will tell you

214
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
If you don't divorce today

215
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
I will push you down

216
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
You can't beat me

217
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Come here

218
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Sign it

219
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Come here

220
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Don't hurt mom

221
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Let go of me

222
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I want to see mom

223
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Sign it

224
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Son

225
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Don't touch my son

226
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
I will beat you to death

227
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Sign it

228
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
If you don't sign, I will beat my son

229
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Sign it

230
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
I will sign it now

231
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
Sign it now

232
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Mom

233
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Mom

234
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Mom is here

235
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Mom is here

236
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Mom is here

237
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Don't cry

238
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Mom

239
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Mom

240
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Mom

241
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Mom

242
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Mom

243
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
But Tang Fei

244
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
It's been so many years

245
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
I am your father

246
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
I remember I died when I was ten

247
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
My father is dead

248
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Tang Fei

249
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Shut up

250
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Who allowed you to talk to your brother like that

251
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Tang Fei

252
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
I know I am sorry to Jia Yu

253
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
But I always want to find a chance

254
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Can you shut up

255
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
I don't want you to talk about him

256
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
What right do you have to talk about him

257
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Tang Fei

258
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Go

259
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Stop

260
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Tang Fei

261
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
I came to you today for other important things

262
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I have a wish

263
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
I hope you can help me complete it

264
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
The script

265
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Yes

266
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
The King of Li Yuan

267
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Yes, this is from Jia Yu

268
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Which is Tang Fei's mother

269
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I wrote a book of 150,000 words before

270
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Unfortunately, it has not been published

271
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Later

272
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I found someone to change it into a movie script

273
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
This is a big movie from Huan Yu's company

274
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
If her son

275
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Can play the leading actor in her play

276
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
I believe if Jia Yu knows

277
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
He will be very happy

278
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
The King of Li Yuan

279
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
This is Jia Yu's wish

280
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Only you can fulfill it

281
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
I am not interested

282
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Tang Fei, don't you think about it

283
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Tang Fei

284
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
This is your mother's wish

285
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
I am not interested

286
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Tang Fei

287
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
This is your mother's wish

288
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
You

289
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Tang Fei

290
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
You are too much

291
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Let go

292
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Tang Fei

293
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Why are you still so stubborn

294
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I don't want to say it

295
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
No

296
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
I believe you will say it

297
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
You can't wait until that day

298
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
What a pity

299
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Lin Xi

300
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Don't pick it up

301
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Go

302
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
Let them go

303
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Dad

304
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Let them go

305
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
The car is waiting for you downstairs

306
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Give him the key

307
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Wait

308
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Miss Jian

309
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
I am very happy to meet you

310
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Although the situation we met today is a bit awkward

311
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
But I hope I can have a chance

312
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
To treat you well

313
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Tang Fei

314
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
I know we will be back soon

315
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Tang Fei, today's matter

316
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
What are you doing

317
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Don't pick it up

318
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
There is a contradiction between you two

319
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
You shouldn't have taken the script

320
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Do you know the relationship between us

321
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Why are you standing here

322
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Yes, I don't understand

323
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
I just know I am very unlucky

324
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
I was brought here

325
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
No matter what the contradiction between you two

326
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
But he has already admitted his mistake

327
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Can't you forgive him

328
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
You let me forgive him

329
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
No matter what he did wrong when he was young

330
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
But he has already reached the end of life

331
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Can't you let go of hatred

332
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Do you want to know why I hate him so much

333
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Tang Fei

334
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Don't kill me

335
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Don't kill me

336
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Don't laugh

337
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Don't laugh

338
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
I told you to follow me

339
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
He

340
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
You want to know the reason, right

341
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Follow me

342
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Mr. Tang

343
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Mr. Tang

344
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
What are you doing

345
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Let me go

346
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Let me go

347
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Let me go

348
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Tang Fei, isn't he

349
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Don't talk

350
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Don't talk

351
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Don't talk

352
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Don't talk

353
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
Don't talk

354
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Don't talk

355
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Don't talk

356
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Don't talk

357
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Don't talk

358
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Don't talk

359
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Don't talk

360
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Don't talk

361
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Don't talk

362
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Don't talk

363
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Don't talk

364
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Don't talk

365
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Did you see it

366
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Yes, she is my mother

367
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Why is she ill

368
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
When they divorced

369
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Her mood is not very stable

370
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Then, I was afraid that Han Zhengde

371
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Will fight to get my custody

372
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
So I ran all over the place

373
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Move

374
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
But the disease

375
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Every day

376
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
I remember at that time

377
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
My mom is a famous writer.

378
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
She writes a lot of things every day.

379
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
She always runs the publishing house.

380
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
But she can't sell the pages.

381
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,160
At that time, we lived in a very cheap basement.

382
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Every night when I woke up,

383
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
I would see her writing under the light.

384
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Later, in order to support me,

385
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
she had to give up writing.

386
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
She played the music of the Lin Gong.

387
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,160
But the situation got worse.

388
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,160
One night, she suddenly jumped out of the bed.

389
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
She screamed desperately.

390
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
She said someone was chasing her.

391
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Later, I saw her screaming.

392
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
She rolled down the stairs.

393
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
At that time, I knew that

394
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
her condition was very serious.

395
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
So she was sent to the mental hospital for the first time.

396
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
The environment there was very harsh.

397
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
The space was narrow and many patients were hospitalized.

398
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
They couldn't get good care at all.

399
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
But I didn't have the ability at that time.

400
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I could only let her live.

401
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
But I hated that place.

402
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
From that day on,

403
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
I was a nightmare every night.

404
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
I couldn't forget my mother's screaming.

405
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Mom.

406
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Don't touch me.

407
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
At that time,

408
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
during the most difficult time for us,

409
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
if she appeared,

410
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
I might forgive her.

411
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
But she didn't.

412
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
She went to find a new house.

413
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
She went to find a new wife.

414
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
She lived a carefree life.

415
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
If my aunt hadn't found me,

416
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
I wouldn't know where I am now.

417
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
But it doesn't matter.

418
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Everything is over now.

419
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
I have the ability to take care of my mom.

420
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
I can give her the best ward.

421
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
I can take good care of her with the best nurse.

422
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Han Zhengde told me today

423
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
that he had a stroke and asked for my forgiveness.

424
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Do you know what I think?

425
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
I think it's the god's will.

426
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
This is his retribution.

427
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
I told you so much.

428
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
I just hope you can understand.

429
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Not everyone in this world

430
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
needs to say sorry to you.

431
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
You need to forgive him.

432
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Do you understand?

433
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Then I think you should go and play that movie.

434
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Not for Han Zhengde.

435
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
It's for aunt.

436
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
This is aunt's work.

437
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
She worked so hard to write it.

438
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Don't you want to help her make her wish come true?

439
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
I'm sorry.

440
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Tang Fei.

441
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:50,660
Here, put the two

442
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
in the same room.

443
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Director, you are so kind.

444
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
I'm sorry to trouble you.

445
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
It's okay.

446
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Then you go ahead.

447
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I'm leaving.

448
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Thank you.

449
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Director.

450
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Shen Yan, why are you here?

451
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
I just passed by the movie theater

452
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
and came to visit you.

453
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
The best Longjing.

454
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Don't you like tea the most?

455
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
You are so thoughtful.

456
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
I don't know what Liu Zhipian thought.

457
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
He actually replaced you.

458
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
I always feel

459
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
a little pity.

460
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
It's okay.

461
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
There will be a chance in the future.

462
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
That's right.

463
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
I heard that

464
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Jianxi asked for leave.

465
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Yes.

466
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
She said she had something urgent today.

467
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
So she asked for leave.

468
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
It's really strange.

469
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Since I met her,

470
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
I've never asked for leave even when I was sick.

471
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Did you find them?

472
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Where did you go last night?

473
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Okay, okay.

474
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
You hurry to her house and wait for her.

475
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
I'm going back to the company now.

476
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
I'll be right there.

477
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Okay.

478
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Jianxi is not feeling well.

479
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
It's just a little cold.

480
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
It will be fine soon.

481
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
I'll go see her.

482
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Is it so fake?

483
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,160
After all, we are friends.

484
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
It's normal for me to go see her.

485
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Thank you for your kindness.

486
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
I will help you convey it.

487
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
The more she doesn't let me go,

488
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,160
the more it proves that there is a problem.

489
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
I'll go to the company.

490
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Tang Fei.

491
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
I didn't come back for a night.

492
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
It's really amazing.

493
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm sorry.

494
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,160
I want to be alone.

495
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Tang Fei.

496
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I know what you want to say.

497
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

498
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Also, because I didn't know the situation,

499
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,160
I apologize to you for what I said to you.

500
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
I'm sorry.

501
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Are you sympathizing with me?

502
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,160
I'm telling you, I'm very strong.

503
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
I don't need sympathy.

504
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm sorry.

505
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I'm fine.

506
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Okay, I'll go with you.

507
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Ji Qing.

508
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Why are you here?

509
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
This is not a place for a free-spirited person.

510
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Ji Qing, your assistant is too much.

511
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
I'm also an actor in the company.

512
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Can't I come to visit?

513
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Put it down.

514
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
What's up?

515
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
You are gaining weight and playing ugly.

516
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,160
You are really working hard to play the role.

517
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry to shoot.

518
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,160
If there is nothing, please...

519
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
How is it?

520
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
The shooting effect is good, right?

521
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,160
I came to tell you

522
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,160
that when you were working hard to shoot,

523
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,160
someone was seducing your boyfriend.

524
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
What do you mean?

525
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Isn't this Jian Xi?

526
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
They have been together since last night

527
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,160
until they came back this morning.

528
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,160
You say, this one night,

529
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
where did they go?

530
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
I don't want you to be deceived,

531
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
so I'm kindly reminding you.

532
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
You...

533
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Jian Xi is my opponent,

534
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
but I will win him fair and square.

535
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
And I hate people like you

536
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
who play tricks behind my back.

537
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,160
I don't want to be someone else's pawn.

538
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Don't pretend to be noble.

539
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
I'm telling you,

540
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
when you lose everything,

541
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
you will regret it.

542
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Good shot.

543
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
A woman like this should be taught a lesson.

544
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Ji Qing, don't believe her.

545
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
But this photo is real.

546
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
They are really together.

547
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
How is that possible?

548
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Jian Xi can't compare to you.

549
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Tang Fei won't give up on you.

550
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
You are with him.

551
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,160
Forget it. Let's get back to work.

552
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Miss Shen.

553
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
Miss Shen.

554
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Why are you so angry?

555
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
You are...

556
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Come.

557
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
I'm Ji Shuren.

558
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
You are Ji Dong?

559
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,160
I just asked someone to bring this to the sample room.

560
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
It's brand new.

561
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Do you want to try it?

562
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Come.

563
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Ji Dong.

564
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
This...

565
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Is this for me?

566
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,160
You are so nice to me.

567
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Today, I've been bullied.

568
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,160
I feel much better now.

569
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Do you want to tell me what's going on?

570
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
I...

571
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
It's okay.

572
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Take your time.

573
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,160
Maybe I can help you.

574
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
After my role was taken away,

575
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,160
I couldn't find a suitable chance to perform.

576
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,160
So you are doing this for a small thing.

577
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,160
This may be a small thing to you.

578
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,160
But it's a big thing to me.

579
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I run around and beg people every day.

580
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
But I can't get a job.

581
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Then...

582
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
What did Qi Wensen say?

583
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
I went to see Mr. Qi.

584
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,160
But he said he didn't care about this.

585
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Even if my role was taken away by Jianxi,

586
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
I can only accept it.

587
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I know.

588
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Actually, I have nothing to do with it.

589
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
I really have nothing to do with it.

590
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
But my mom...

591
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,160
My mom's medical bills haven't been paid.

592
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
I don't know what to do.

593
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
What's wrong with Qi Wensen?

594
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Why does our actress feel helpless?

595
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Really.

596
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Come on.

597
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Don't be sad.

598
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Wipe your tears.

599
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Don't cry.

600
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Ji Dong.

601
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
Can you help me?

602
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
I...

603
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
I know.

604
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
You are the board of directors.

605
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
You won't have time to care about us.

606
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
But I really have no way out.

607
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Please help me.

608
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Please help me.

609
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Please help me.

610
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Okay.

611
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Really?

612
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
Don't worry.

613
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
I'll help you think of a way.

614
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
You are so nice.

615
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
You are so nice to me.

616
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
From now on,

617
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,160
just call me Shen Yan.

618
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Okay.

619
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Shen Yan.

620
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Here, drink some water.

621
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Tell me.

622
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Where did you go last night?

623
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Why didn't you answer my phone?

624
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Say something.

625
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
Why are you so nervous?

626
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Of course I'm nervous.

627
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
I'm your agent.

628
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
I always know what you are doing.

629
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
What's wrong with you?

630
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
What can I do?

631
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
You are so clever.

632
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
You look much better.

633
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Enough.

634
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Don't bother me.

635
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
I'm watching the drama.

636
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
It's a little weird.

637
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
It's a little weird.

638
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Brother Fei.

639
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
I'm here to say hello to you.

640
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
I just knew that

641
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
she had become the actress's sister.

642
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Before the meeting,

643
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
she suddenly decided to change her.

644
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Miss Shen is also capable.

645
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Mr. Ji personally recommended me.

646
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Thanks to him,

647
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
I can successfully play

648
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
the Jasmine in Beauty.

649
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
So I said that Miss Shen is the most capable.

650
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
There is no way.

651
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Jianxi has luck.

652
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Ji Qin has a background.

653
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
I have nothing.

654
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
I have to find a way.

655
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
No way.

656
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
You have a good taste.

657
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
I know.

658
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
There were a lot of misunderstandings before.

659
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
But now in the same crew,

660
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
I hope you don't mind the money.

661
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Get along well.

662
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Get along well.

663
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Get along well.

664
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Get along well.

665
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
What are you doing?

666
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
What Mr. Ji personally explained

667
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
the director is nodding his head at him.

668
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
What are you doing?

669
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
I am happy.

670
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
I am happy too.

671
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
If there is no one,

672
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
I want to beat him to death.

673
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Miss Zuo.

674
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Pull my chair over a little bit.

675
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
OK.

676
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
I am really happy

677
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
to be able to act your sister this time.

678
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
We seem to have not yet

679
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
officially cooperated.

680
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
I am also very curious.

681
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Shouldn't you go and play

682
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
a sad movie?

683
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
You want to take the leading role

684
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
of the Phoenix Film Festival, right?

685
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
What's wrong?

686
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
You were snatched away by Jiansi

687
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
by the female doctor.

688
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
You came here to play a little role.

689
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
How pitiful.

690
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Miss Zuo likes Keruo too much

691
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
that she will be enemies everywhere.

692
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
She still can't die.

693
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
Yes.

694
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I will let everyone know

695
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
who I like.

696
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Even if others laugh at me,

697
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
so what?

698
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
What are you?

699
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
Why are you here?

700
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
Why are you here

701
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
so excited?

702
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
I just want to tell you

703
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
that Kele used to like Jiansi.

704
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,160
So now

705
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
she will be mine.

706
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Stop dreaming.

707
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Whether it is a dream or not,

708
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
let's wait and see.

709
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
OK.

710
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Then every day in the film studio in the future,

711
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
you will have a wonderful time.

712
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Do you know why Changfei is obsessed

713
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
with 21 souls?

714
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Because Changfei loves his family very much.

715
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
He thinks that

716
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
even if he is dead,

717
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
his soul

718
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
will still protect the people he loves.

719
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
That's right.

720
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
So when Changfei sees

721
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
sister dancing on the street,

722
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
what will he do?

723
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Blame yourself,

724
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
be touched,

725
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
and

726
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
be shocked.

727
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
This stage is very important.

728
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
I hope you can hold on to it.

729
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Three, two, one.

730
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Action.

731
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Mom,

732
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
that's sister.

733
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Yes.

734
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
I never knew

735
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
that sister liked dancing so much.

736
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
If it weren't for me,

737
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,160
sister wouldn't have given up dancing to study medicine.

738
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Cut.

739
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Jiansi, it's not like that.

740
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
You always thought that Changran wanted to be a doctor.

741
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
But recently you found that

742
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
your sister doesn't like being a doctor.

743
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Changran likes dancing.

744
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Your sister loves you the most

745
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
for giving up her true dream in her heart.

746
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
For you to pretend in front of everyone,

747
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
do you think your love is enough?

748
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
I...

749
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Think about it carefully.

750
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Changfei is passionate and cheerful, full of hope.

751
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,160
If you only use tears to show your tears,

752
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
it's too ordinary.

753
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Do it again.

754
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Do you understand?

755
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Act well.

756
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Try to get over it.

757
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Huo Yuanwei, do it again.

758
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
Everyone, come on.

759
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Fall.

760
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
Three times.

761
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Action.

762
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
Why are you here?

763
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Did you encounter any problems during the shoot?

764
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
I don't know.

765
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
You don't know?

766
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
I don't know.

767
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
In principle,

768
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
Jiansi and Changfei should act very well.

769
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,160
But this one is always a bit difficult to get over.

770
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Mom.

771
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,160
That's my sister.

772
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
Cut.

773
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Cut.

774
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Jiansi,

775
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
don't make such a weak expression.

776
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
Changfei is definitely not a child who will cry easily.

777
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Try not to cry as soon as you speak.

778
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Do it again.

779
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Ready.

780
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Three times.

781
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Action.

782
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
Mom.

783
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Cut.

784
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Jiansi,

785
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
I told you to control your tears,

786
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,160
not to make a weak expression.

787
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
My sister is chasing her dream.

788
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
How can Changfei react like this?

789
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Do it again.

790
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Three times.

791
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Action.

792
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Cut.

793
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
Do it again.

794
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Do you know how to act?

795
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
Who plays with you over and over again?

796
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Can we still shoot today?

797
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
If we can't shoot, let's shoot tomorrow.

798
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I really don't understand why the producer chose you.

799
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Shen Yan is obviously better than you.

800
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Where's the umbrella?

801
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
Coming, teacher.

802
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
I'm sorry.

803
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
I'm sorry.

804
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
I'm sorry.

805
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
What should I do?

806
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
I've been bad.

807
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
I filmed so many scenes.

808
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,160
This role was not that easy.

809
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
So let's do it again.

810
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Don't worry.

811
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Anxin,

812
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
did you bring flowers today?

813
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
No.

814
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
I just came and sent them to the dressing room.

815
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
There's nothing today.

816
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
There's a note on it.

817
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
No.

818
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,160
This is the meal that the teacher asked me to have at eight o'clock tonight.

819
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
Do you think the flowers

820
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
were sent by Lu Zhou?

821
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
Impossible.

822
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Absolutely impossible.

823
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Is it really the teacher?

824
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
This dressing room is not a place

825
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
that anyone can come in.

826
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Only he has the motivation.

827
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Motivation?

828
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Yes.

829
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Pretend that your fans support you.

830
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Do you remember when you received the flowers for the first time?

831
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
When the audience questioned me.

832
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
That's it.

833
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
How would the audience know so much?

834
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
It must be sent by Lu Zhou.

835
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Is it really the teacher?

836
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,160
You'll know when you ask him at night.

837
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
I'm not sure.

838
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
I'm not sure.

839
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
I'm not sure.

840
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
You'll know when you ask him at night.

841
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Could it be that

842
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
the person who has been supporting me is the teacher?

843
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
This way, please.

844
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Hello, sir.

845
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
The guest you've been waiting for has arrived.

846
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
Teacher.

847
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Is it really you?

848
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
What's wrong?

849
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Look at you now.

850
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
You seem to have fully recovered.

851
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
Thanks to you,

852
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
I can get Chang Fei's role.

853
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
What's wrong?

854
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Is there something on my face?

855
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Whether you can play Chang Fei's role well

856
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,160
will be the most important step in your life.

857
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Actually, for me,

858
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
every role is equally important.

859
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
It's different.

860
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
What's different?

861
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
I want you to use Chang Fei's role

862
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,160
to get the best female lead in Phoenix Film Festival.

863
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
How is that possible?

864
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
What's impossible about that?

865
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,160
I haven't fully grasped the role yet.

866
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Then go and get it completely.

867
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
It's too difficult.

868
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
I'm sorry.

869
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
Do you see this rose?

870
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Its flowering period is only 15 days.

871
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,160
It must be put into bloom.

872
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Jian Xi,

873
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,160
you're like this rose.

874
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
If you can't experience the whole scene

875
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
when you're most beautiful,

876
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
you'll soon be ruined.

877
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
So,

878
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
I want you to get the best female lead

879
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,160
in Phoenix Film Festival.

880
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
What about the love story?

881
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,160
It's your dream to defeat her.

882
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,160
Either you follow the trend and continue to be mediocre,

883
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
or you'll be on top of the world.

884
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Jian Xi,

885
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,160
this is an important step in your life.

886
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
As long as you play Chang Fei well,

887
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,160
you'll be the biggest black horse this year.

888
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Can I really win?

889
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Don't ask me about this.

890
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
Ask yourself.

891
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Because no one can answer you.

892
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
This scene is

893
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,160
Mo Liwei being molested by Xi Wen

894
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
and playing with her friends secretly.

895
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Xi Wen strictly taught her.

896
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Zuo Zuo,

897
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
the Xi Wen you play

898
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
loves your sister very much.

899
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
So, you must be cruel

900
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
and be kind to her.

901
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
I understand.

902
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Okay.

903
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Okay.

904
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Make up.

905
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Help Zuo Zuo to fix her makeup.

906
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Okay.

907
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Shen Yan,

908
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,160
what if Zuo Zuo asks you to help her?

909
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
What if Zuo Zuo asks you to check her?

910
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
How about I tell the director

911
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
to change this scene?

912
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
I've already told him.

913
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
The director didn't agree.

914
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
He said it must be real.

915
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
What should we do?

916
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
We can't be beaten for nothing.

917
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
You go and help me with something later.

918
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Everyone,

919
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,160
three, two, one. Action.

920
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Cut.

921
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Zuo Zuo, I've told you.

922
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Your expression must be painful.

923
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
You're being cruel.

924
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,160
Director, I'm sorry.

925
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
I misunderstood.

926
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Should I do this?

927
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Please, Miss.

928
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,160
I didn't even say action.

929
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Shen Yan, are you okay?

930
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Director, I'm sorry.

931
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,160
My hand is too fast.

932
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
How about we do it again?

933
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Slowly.

934
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Ready. One more.

935
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
Okay, director.

936
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
Zuo Zuo, you're too much.

937
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
You'll know

938
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,160
what it means to be shameless

939
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
after you've been

940
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
being nice to me for eight or ten times.

941
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
Shen Yan.

942
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Shen Yan, are you okay?

943
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
I'm fine.

944
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Don't worry.

945
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
You said you're fine.

946
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
You were so angry just now.

947
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
You're blushing.

948
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
I'm really fine.

949
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,160
Don't worry about me.

950
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
I'll take you to the hospital.

951
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
No need.

952
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
I can go by myself.

953
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
No.

954
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
I'll drive you back.

955
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
No.

956
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
If Zuo Zuo knows,

957
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
she'll misunderstand me

958
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
and I'll get into trouble.

959
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
I have to act.

960
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
No.

961
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Zuo Zuo?

962
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
What does it have to do with her?

963
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Is it because of me

964
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
that she's taking revenge on you?

965
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Is it?

966
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
I'll make it clear to her.

967
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Zuo Zuo is right.

968
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
I...

969
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
I do like you.

970
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
I know you like Jian Xin very much.

971
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
You should have noticed

972
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
that I'm not like you.

973
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
I've been hiding in the corner

974
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,160
and watching you silently.

975
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
I know it's impossible

976
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,160
to be self-willed.

977
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
So I didn't think

978
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
of telling you.

979
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
But Zuo Zuo found out.

980
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
He warned me

981
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,160
not to get close to you.

982
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
I couldn't do it.

983
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
There's no way

984
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
to control the love of a person.

985
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
So he'll hit me on purpose

986
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
on the set today.

987
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
But

988
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
I can't stop

989
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
my feelings for you.

990
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Shen Yan.

991
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Ke Lu.

992
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Have you never

993
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
noticed me?

994
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
I'm afraid

995
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,160
it's too late to fantasize.

996
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
The rain is falling

997
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,160
on the flowers.

998
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
The moonlight

999
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,160
shines on me tonight.

1000
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,160
I sing with loneliness

1001
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,160
and my carefree heart.

1002
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
I watch the flowers

1003
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160
wither and wither.

1004
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
I watch loneliness

1005
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
and sadness.

1006
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,160
I watch the tide

1007
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,160
and the cold

1008
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,160
and the bright

1009
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
and the dark.

1010
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
I have too many

1011
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,160
expectations

1012
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,160
and I become

1013
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
desperate in the end.

1014
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
I watch you

1015
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
coming and going

1016
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
and hugging the wind and frost.

1017
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,160
Everything is flustered.

1018
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,160
I'm too stubborn

1019
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,160
to be young and crazy.

1020
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
I don't want to live

1021
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,160
in a lie.

1022
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,160
I look back

1023
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,160
and I'll think about it again.

1024
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,160
You and I

1025
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,160
are getting lost on the road.

1026
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
I don't want to think

1027
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,160
about anything

1028
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,160
because I'm too crazy.

1029
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,160
Where is the sea of ​​blood?

1030
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
Just wait for

1031
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,160
a person to dawn.

1032
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
Just wait for

1033
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,160
a person to dawn.

1034
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Just wait for

1035
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,160
a person to dawn.
