1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Walk down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Miss you

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Love you

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is weak or weak

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
At that moment

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
The old age

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,240
Turned into a magical eye

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,920
Pass through the loneliness to find you

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,040
Wear the most solid gold armor

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,920
Hold the weapon in your hand

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Use all your strength to fight for the most real self

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the little trick

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what rumors

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,080
I will definitely be invincible

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't want you to be willing

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Where is the gold?

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,440
In the past, I kept this sweet

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,760
No matter where your heart is

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,080
My heart is here

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
Even if the iron armor is invincible

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm only one you

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Episode 16

30
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
I understand

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,440
He wants to help us

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Don't come over

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Don't come over

34
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Jianxi

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
I won't eat you

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
Don't be nervous

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Director Yuan

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Shen Yan is my best friend

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
I believe him unconditionally

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,440
So I don't believe every word you say

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Jianxi, Jianxi

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm kidding

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,440
I'll go for a walk

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,440
When I was little, my teacher taught me

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,440
If you put a coin on your wrist

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,440
This training can strengthen the force of your fingers

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
I can make a hand stand for Jianxi

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
By then, your camera only needs to take her face

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,440
And then my hand

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Today is Shen Yan's date

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
But he didn't come

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
This society is very complicated

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,440
The human heart is more dark than you think

54
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,440
You will understand in the future

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Now these female actors

56
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
For the sake of the position

57
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Can do anything

58
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Don't say it, don't say it

59
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Jianxi is here

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Jianxi

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
No wonder you can win me

62
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
So willing to give up

63
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
What are you talking about

64
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Female actors for the sake of the position

65
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Hotel, restaurant, and tour

66
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
So scary

67
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
The title of the text

68
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
I don't

69
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
No

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Look at this photo

71
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
You dare to say

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,440
You didn't go to the director's room at midnight

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
I really didn't think of it

74
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
You want to get a role

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Can do such a shameless thing

76
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
Do you want you to tell me

77
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I can give it to you

78
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Why make yourself so

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
What a mess

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Shut up

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Nausea

82
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
You are angry with me

83
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
It's useless

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Now you are making trouble

85
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Everyone knows

86
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
You are making trouble

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Jianxi

88
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
This time

89
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,440
You ruined your own future

90
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
No one will help you

91
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
Step aside

92
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
Chen

93
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Shen Yan

94
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Chen

95
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Teacher

96
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Do you think

97
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Jianxi is strange today

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Is there

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Today in the newspaper

100
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Posted a photo of Jianxi entering and leaving the room

101
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Not only photos

102
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
There are also large篇幅 text

103
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
What to say to verify

104
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Jianxi's more than a year of

105
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
The way to the top

106
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Top

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
First is Ouyang Mountain's movie

108
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
It's a popular variety show

109
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Now return to the camp

110
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,440
But in the eyes of the audience

111
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
Jianxi is a

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Relying on the US Department of Commerce

113
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Third-rate actress

114
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
For a female actor

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,440
The killing power of the scandal is very terrible

116
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Especially such peach-colored news

117
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
You see

118
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
He is indeed this kind of person

119
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Headline

120
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Headline

121
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Dating for nine days

122
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
My god

123
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Is this true

124
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Shen Yan is there

125
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I'm asking you

126
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Jianxi

127
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
It's you

128
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
What happened

129
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Pretend

130
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
You pretend

131
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
You know it clearly

132
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
You pretend to be nothing

133
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Shen Yan, your acting is so good

134
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Great

135
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Is there any misunderstanding

136
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Why are you so angry

137
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Did I do something wrong

138
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
I'm going to make a mistake

139
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
I apologize to you

140
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Are you embarrassed to say that

141
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,440
I always thought you were kind and weak

142
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,440
So I stand in front of you

143
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
But in the end

144
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
The person who stabbed me in the back is you

145
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
What are you talking about

146
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Why don't I understand at all

147
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
You listen to me

148
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Yuan Dao took you to the hotel

149
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
I went

150
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Where are you

151
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Where are you

152
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Where are you

153
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
I didn't

154
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
You still lie

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Jianxi

156
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Jianxi

157
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Let me go

158
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
I have here

159
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
I have here

160
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
The call record you called me

161
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Do you still want to deny

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I did call you

163
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
But I just told you this morning

164
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
When to put on makeup

165
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
I don't know at all

166
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
You are dating Yuan Dao

167
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
I don't know

168
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
There are reporters to take pictures

169
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Really

170
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Jianxi is really good

171
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
I never

172
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Because of the character

173
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Deceived yourself

174
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Shen Ye, you are good

175
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Say what I am to you

176
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
No matter what others say about you

177
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I choose to believe you

178
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
But how do you treat me

179
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Do you know this knife is very painful

180
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
I am your assistant

181
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Of course I stand on your side

182
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
I advised you

183
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Don't treat yourself as a top pet

184
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
But you just don't listen to me

185
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Now something happened

186
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
How can you bite the nail

187
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
I betrayed you

188
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
I can't

189
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
I will never tell the reporters

190
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Because I have always

191
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Always

192
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,440
I treat you as my best friend

193
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Why are you lying

194
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Jianxi

195
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Jianxi, come here

196
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Come here

197
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Let me go

198
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Let them know

199
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
I don't have

200
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
I believe you

201
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
I don't have

202
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
I believe you

203
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
I believe you

204
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Let me go

205
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Jianxi

206
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Jianxi

207
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
I ask you

208
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Have you been to the hotel

209
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
You also believe in that picture

210
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Of the Zixu's friend, right

211
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I believe you

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
I also know you

213
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Just because I know your obsession with acting

214
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
I'm afraid you will be a role

215
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
And go the wrong way

216
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
No matter what

217
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I won't betray myself because of a role

218
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Then you can't play the music

219
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Why can you still be in the crew

220
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Shen Ye told you

221
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Of course he said

222
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Because this is his plan

223
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Shen Ye is so kind

224
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
How could he frame you

225
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
I can't talk to you

226
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
You don't take me as a friend

227
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Jianxi

228
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Jianxi

229
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Shen Ye

230
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Let him calm down

231
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Let go

232
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
How to calm down

233
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
His reputation has been ruined

234
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Can he still shoot in the future

235
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
I'm really worried

236
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
I will explain to the director

237
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Director

238
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Tang Fei, you are back

239
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Jianxi didn't come

240
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Where did he go

241
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Something happened to him

242
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Someone took a picture of him

243
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Went to the hotel in the middle of the night

244
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Entered Yuan's room

245
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
The picture was taken very clearly

246
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
No problem at all

247
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
I am also very worried about him

248
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Jianxi

249
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Open the door

250
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Jianxi

251
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Open the door

252
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Come and sit

253
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
What's the matter with you

254
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Why do you come to me so late

255
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
You also know

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
The recent rumors are getting worse

257
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
For the sake of the movie

258
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
The company decided to temporarily replace you

259
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
What do you mean

260
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
The meaning is

261
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
This movie doesn't need you to play

262
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
I have already played half

263
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
What are you looking for

264
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
I understand

265
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
You are right

266
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
The person we chose is Shen Yan

267
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
He has a professional piano base

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
I also know the script very well

269
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Of course, in this emergency

270
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
It is indeed risky to hire a new person

271
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
But for now

272
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
This is our best choice

273
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
I hope you can understand us

274
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
After all, you can't do it alone

275
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Influence our whole movie

276
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I disagree

277
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Things have come to this point

278
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Not only you

279
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Director Yuan has already self-requited

280
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
I don't want to be a burden to you

281
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
I have already self-requited

282
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Because you caused a huge loss to the movie

283
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
No requirement to compensate

284
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
It is already an unfortunate accident

285
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Jian Xin, you are a smart person

286
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Self-request and forced to quit

287
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
You know the choice

288
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Jian Xin, I'm sorry

289
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
I really don't know why

290
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Why is it like this

291
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Don't you know why

292
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,440
But don't worry

293
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Even for you

294
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
I will definitely play well

295
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,440
You will play well

296
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
From start to finish, you have seen how I play this piano

297
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
You must remember all my thoughts

298
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
I am too stupid

299
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
I only knew today

300
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Why are you betraying me

301
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
You only know to blame me

302
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Don't you feel any guilt

303
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
After all, it's because of you

304
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
The movie will be damaged

305
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Because of me

306
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
You are too embarrassed to say it's because of me

307
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Fortunately, the reporters did not enter the hotel room

308
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Otherwise, more unread photos will be exposed

309
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
What will you do then

310
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
Jian Xin, I want to tell you

311
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
The opportunity to act is indeed very important

312
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,440
But it's not worth it for you to betray yourself

313
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
As your friend

314
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I really don't want you to be like this

315
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Don't be like this in the future, okay?

316
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Otherwise you will regret it

317
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Thank you Gao Jie

318
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
As your friend

319
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
I also have one word for you

320
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
A little ugly

321
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Betraying a friend

322
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Will not be successful

323
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Anyway

324
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
We are in a good relationship

325
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
We will definitely cooperate successfully

326
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Shen Yan, take care of him

327
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Don't worry

328
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm sorry

329
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
I'm sorry

330
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
I'm sorry

331
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm sorry

332
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I'm sorry

333
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
I'm sorry

334
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
Shen Yan, you have seen it

335
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
What do you need me to do?

336
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
During the recording of the female piano

337
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Please be her guide

338
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Using her piano skills

339
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I need to know

340
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Teacher Lu

341
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Actually, I have always admired you

342
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Not only the piano

343
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
I also hope

344
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
In acting

345
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Can learn from you

346
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
Is there a problem?

347
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Good

348
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Thank you

349
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Teacher

350
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Teacher

351
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
I will go into the classroom and wait for you

352
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Okay

353
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Teacher, why did you call Shen Yan?

354
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
This is the company's arrangement

355
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
You are lying

356
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
With your personality

357
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
What you don't want to do

358
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I will not agree

359
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Then why don't I agree?

360
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Because he

361
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Because he is weak on the surface

362
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Deep in the heart

363
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Do things without means, right?

364
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
You know

365
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
From the moment you hurt your hand

366
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Since you know

367
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
Then why don't you tell you

368
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
I was just suspecting

369
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Now it's really confirmed

370
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
No one has the obligation to help you

371
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
To deal with these things

372
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
All things

373
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
You have to find it yourself

374
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
To experience

375
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Including being betrayed?

376
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Of course

377
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Every time I encounter difficulties

378
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
The teacher looks at me with a straight face

379
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
Walk into the deadlock

380
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Now I have to be a teacher for Shen Yan

381
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
You are my teacher

382
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
I have always been grateful to you

383
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
But sometimes

384
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
I really don't know

385
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
What you think

386
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Jianxi

387
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
You have to face this reality yourself

388
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
You have to understand

389
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Only a determined, smart and decisive person

390
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Can achieve success

391
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Like you, so impulsive

392
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Will only touch the head

393
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
From today

394
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
You are no longer my student

395
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Why?

396
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Because you are too ungrateful

397
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
What I need

398
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Always the best student

399
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Teacher

400
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Shen Yan

401
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Teacher

402
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
You are here

403
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Which part do you not understand?

404
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Which part?

405
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
This part

406
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
I have been holding you back

407
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Teacher Lu

408
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
I am now

409
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
A formal actress

410
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
I know

411
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Actually, getting the role is not so important to me

412
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
The important thing is

413
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
I am one step closer to you

414
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Teacher Lu

415
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
I have been holding back a lot of words

416
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
Never told you

417
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
I don't know if I can say it today

418
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Don't be angry

419
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Ok

420
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Come, you say it

421
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
I listen

422
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
When I first met you

423
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
I was still a trainee at the bar

424
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
I was bullied

425
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
I dare not say it

426
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
You stood up to help me solve the problem

427
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Really?

428
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
I don't remember

429
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Besides, this is a small thing

430
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
It doesn't matter if you don't remember

431
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,440
Actually, not everyone

432
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Don't want to help me

433
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
I just

434
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
I hate their sympathy

435
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Only you

436
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Only you are different

437
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
I don't think there is any difference

438
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
I feel it

439
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
I know

440
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
You are different from them

441
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Because you didn't use the eyes of the low class

442
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
To look at me

443
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Then I saw you again

444
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I am really very very happy

445
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
It's a pity that my identity is low

446
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Just a little assistant

447
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
It's different now

448
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
I am already a female actor

449
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
I can play movies

450
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
I know

451
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Jianxi is your most proud student

452
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
You put all your heart and soul

453
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
On her

454
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
But she is now

455
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Stop talking, I understand

456
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
You want to be my student, right?

457
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
I

458
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Not

459
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
But

460
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
My admiration for you

461
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Not only

462
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Is the student's teacher

463
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
I actually

464
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
I have always secretly liked you

465
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Like me?

466
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Why?

467
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
I never even paid attention to you

468
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Never paid attention to me

469
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Never paid attention to me, it doesn't matter

470
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
You just have to pay attention to me from now on

471
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
Okay

472
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
You want me to act well

473
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
I will work harder

474
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I will not be like Jianxi

475
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Half-hearted

476
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Can you start now

477
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Just look at me

478
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Just look at me

479
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
I will definitely let you see

480
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
I deserve your love

481
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Are you done?

482
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
I think you misunderstood me

483
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Yes

484
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
I am looking for an excellent student

485
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Teaching them

486
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
But the problem is

487
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
I never plan to accept you as my student

488
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Not to mention liking you

489
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Teacher

490
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Do you hate me?

491
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Is it because you listened to Jianxi

492
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Those are all slandering me

493
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Her business really has nothing to do with me

494
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
This has nothing to do with her

495
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Of course

496
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
I didn't blame you

497
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
The reason I helped you

498
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Was entrusted by Qi Wensen

499
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Nothing else

500
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
Start class

501
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
I don't understand

502
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
I don't understand

503
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
I am working so hard to get close to you

504
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Why are you not willing to

505
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Say I am your student?

506
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
You should give me a reason

507
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Is it because

508
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
You still have hope for Jianxi?

509
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
But she is dead

510
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
She can't get up again

511
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
I believe

512
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
She will get up

513
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
No, it's impossible

514
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
She is now in a state of panic

515
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
No one will use her anymore

516
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
I don't know when

517
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
I believe I am right

518
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
She must be the most dazzling star

519
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
I really like you

520
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
I really like you for a long time

521
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Teacher

522
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
And your piano

523
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
I can only understand your piano

524
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
I am your student

525
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Xianyan

526
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Xianyan

527
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
If I were you

528
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
I would put my time

529
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
On learning

530
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
Not on my life

531
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
But I really like you

532
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
I am sorry

533
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
I never paid attention to you

534
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
I will not do that again

535
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
If you are studying

536
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
I can stay

537
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
If there is anything else

538
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
I am sorry

539
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I should go to class

540
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
See you

541
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
Jianxi

542
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Jianxi

543
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
They all like Jianxi

544
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
I must be the most

545
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
The most

546
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
The most

547
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
What do you want from me

548
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Ke Lu

549
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
These days

550
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
I feel very terrible

551
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
I never thought

552
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
I want to replace Jianxi

553
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,040
How righteous and kind.

554
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,440
I treat him as my best friend.

555
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,240
How could I hurt him?

556
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,840
We didn't expect this to happen.

557
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,440
The crew couldn't find the right person

558
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
to push me up.

559
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,640
I didn't want to hurt Jiansi.

560
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,640
But he made a bigger misunderstanding

561
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,440
because of me.

562
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,840
Kelo, do you know?

563
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,240
Jiansi actually...

564
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,840
She actually thought it was me

565
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,440
who exposed Jiansi and made her lose her role.

566
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,840
Since then, she has been hating me.

567
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,840
I've been lying to her.

568
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,240
But she didn't even give me a chance to explain.

569
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,440
Jiansi is very stubborn.

570
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
She won't be angry with others easily.

571
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,440
And she won't forgive me easily.

572
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,440
But I'm innocent.

573
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,240
I'm innocent.

574
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,840
I don't know why things have turned out this way.

575
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,240
We're so close.

576
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,240
I really don't know what to do.

577
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,240
What should I do?

578
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,040
Caifeng.

579
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,240
Believe me.

580
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,040
I really don't know anything.

581
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
I don't know anything.

582
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
But...

583
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,840
Can you help me ask her out?

584
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,840
Jiansi won't see you in this situation.

585
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,440
And she's angry with me.

586
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,440
I know.

587
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,240
I know she's angry with you.

588
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,440
But she still treats you as a friend.

589
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,840
As long as you bow to her first,

590
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,840
she'll come out.

591
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
Let me think about it.

592
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,640
Kelo, I'm begging you.

593
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,840
I'm begging you.

594
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,440
When I was in the most difficult time,

595
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,240
Jiansi gave me warmth.

596
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,640
I really don't want to lose her.

597
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,840
I'm begging you, okay?

598
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,840
What do you want me to do?

599
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,240
You're great.

600
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,840
You're great.

601
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,840
Tomorrow is the movie's kill-game.

602
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
I want to ask Jiansi out

603
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,640
at the kill-game.

604
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,440
I want to get rid of all the misunderstandings.

605
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Okay.

606
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,640
Thank you.

607
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,440
Now, she's completely replacing Jiansi.

608
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,240
Look at her.

609
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,640
Xiaoxiao, do you think Jiansi is that kind of person?

610
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,040
What kind of person?

611
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,640
Miss Ji,

612
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,240
do you think all girls are as kind and cute as you?

613
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,640
Girls like them

614
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,240
can do anything.

615
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
To get a role,

616
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
they go to the director's house at night.

617
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
I've seen a lot of girls like this.

618
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Otherwise, she can't play the piano.

619
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,240
How can she stay until now?

620
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,840
She's already replaced her.

621
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
Ji Qing,

622
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,840
she's in this state

623
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
because she saved herself.

624
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
She deserves it.

625
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,240
Don't take her in your heart.

626
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,440
Is that true?

627
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,440
She even posted a picture.

628
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,040
How can it be fake?

629
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
In my opinion,

630
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,640
Miss Shen is much better than Jiansi.

631
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,240
She's smart and obedient.

632
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,040
We all like her.

633
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,240
Jiansi.

634
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,440
Walk slowly.

635
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Jiansi.

636
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,640
Jiansi, wait for me.

637
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Jiansi.

638
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
Are you still mad at me?

639
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,240
No.

640
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
It was my fault last time.

641
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,840
My語氣 is too strong.

642
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,440
I want to apologize to you.

643
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,200
I...

644
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,240
Just like what you said, we are friends.

645
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,360
We are old friends now.

646
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,600
You won't forgive me for making such a small mistake?

647
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,400
I...

648
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,680
As your friend, I should trust you.

649
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,320
If you are still angry,

650
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,720
why don't you calm down and calm down?

651
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,440
Forget it.

652
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,280
I'm not angry at you.

653
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,200
I'm angry because I'm too stupid.

654
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,600
You're not stupid.

655
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,440
I'm too stupid.

656
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,120
I'm stupid.

657
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,640
To apologize,

658
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,440
I'll treat you to dinner at 7 p.m.

659
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,160
I have to work at 8 p.m.

660
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,400
Just one hour?

661
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,640
I accept your apology.

662
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,080
I don't need to eat.

663
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,240
If you don't want to go,

664
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,960
I'll pretend that you still won't forgive me.

665
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,800
Then just one hour.

666
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,360
Come on.

667
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,000
Cheers.

668
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,720
Come on.

669
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,560
Cheers.

670
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,680
Drink more.

671
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,960
Come on.

672
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,280
Come on.

673
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,880
Come on.

674
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,280
Cheers.

675
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,640
Cheers.

676
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,680
Thank you for your support.

677
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Thank you.

678
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,040
Come on.

679
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,880
Come on.

680
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,440
Let's drink.

681
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:06,960
Thank you.

682
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,120
Thank you for your help.

683
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,280
I hope you can have fun.

684
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Cheers.

685
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,160
Yeah.

686
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,800
What?

687
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,600
He's so drunk.

688
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
He's so drunk.

689
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
He's so drunk.

690
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
He's so drunk.

691
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,360
He's so drunk.

692
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,840
Jianxi is here.

693
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,160
Today is the anniversary.

694
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,240
Why is she here?

695
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
What else can she do?

696
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,560
She must be here to make trouble.

697
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,360
Brother Jiang,

698
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,000
thank you for making me look so beautiful.

699
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,440
Thank you.

700
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,360
You're welcome.

701
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,160
Shen Yan.

702
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,560
Why?

703
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,480
There's a misunderstanding between you two.

704
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,880
I hope you can get rid of the misunderstanding

706
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,160
and make good friends again.

707
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,880
Jianxi.

708
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,400
I didn't expect you to come.

709
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,200
I'm so happy.

710
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Kelo, thank you.

711
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,040
Just say it out loud.

712
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,120
Jianxi is here.

713
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,080
I don't know why she's here.

714
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,520
She's still not convinced.

715
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,480
I don't know what she's doing here.

716
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,880
If she makes trouble here,

717
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,080
it'll be a good show.

718
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,720
Sha Qingyan.

719
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,960
You two are here to stimulate me, right?

720
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,080
Jianxi.

721
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,920
How can you think so?

722
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,720
You really misunderstood me.

723
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,400
I was really sad before.

724
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,360
I accidentally took your role.

725
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,400
The director is about to start a new play.

726
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,760
He's looking for an important role.

727
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,800
I want to recommend you to him.

728
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,920
Is that right?

729
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,600
Jianxi.

730
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,640
I believe Shen Yan is sincere.

731
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,480
You two used to be good friends.

732
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
You've been helping each other for so long.

733
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,080
Do you want to give up this friendship so easily?

734
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,360
Kelo.

735
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,920
Let's have a chat alone.

736
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,680
Okay.

737
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,800
What are you doing?

738
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,240
Doing what I should do.

739
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,440
Do you know what you're doing?

740
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,840
What do you mean?

741
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,800
Did I do something wrong?

742
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,560
I just hope they can get back together.

743
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,360
Look.

744
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,640
The few girls in the team are about to turn their faces.

745
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,600
They're more exciting than TV dramas.

746
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,280
Why did you call me here?

747
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,160
Are you here to show your victory

748
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,640
or to trample on my dignity again?

749
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,880
Jianxi, don't think like that.

750
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,880
I really want to help you.

751
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,320
I really want to help you.

752
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,960
Introduce me to a new director?

753
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,600
Of course.

754
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,560
As long as you want.

755
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,360
Your face is so innocent.

756
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,560
You're so ungrateful.

757
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
I was fooled by your face.

758
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,880
I did stupid things.

759
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,120
But I believe

760
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,320
you can't rely on your face to eat.

761
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,040
How can you say that to me?

762
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,480
Don't pretend to be innocent in front of me.

763
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,200
I have immunity against you.

764
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,320
Jianxi.

765
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,520
Today is the wedding banquet.

766
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,760
Please be patient even if you test me again.

767
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,440
The wedding banquet is so stupid.

768
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,880
It's so ungrateful.

769
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,640
Hong Jiu, thank you.

770
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,480
It's so ungrateful.

771
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,640
You're right.

772
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,120
I should have been more generous.

773
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,440
Congratulations.

774
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,680
Jianxi, what are you doing?

775
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Jianxi.

776
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,840
I don't regret to be your friend.

777
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,080
You let me know the meaning of the word, ungrateful.

778
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,280
I did this

779
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,040
just to remember my great moment.

780
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,680
Jianxi, how can you be so cruel?

781
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,240
Shen Yan is so nice to you.

782
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,680
So I'm sorry for that.

783
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,680
She's so cruel.

784
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,440
Shen Yan, don't cry.

785
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,240
Yeah, why do you have to do this for that kind of despicable friend?

786
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,160
Yeah, she's so kind to invite him.

787
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,600
She doesn't appreciate it.

788
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,360
Yeah, she's so cruel.

789
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,160
Sorry, Shen Yan.

790
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,760
She's so shameless.

791
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,480
Sorry.

792
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,400
Shen Yan can't be interviewed now.

793
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,640
Tell me the truth.

794
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,160
What does it have to do with me?

795
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,560
I don't.

796
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,440
Who else can it be?

797
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,920
We saw it with our own eyes yesterday.

798
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,680
You spilled the wine on Shen Yan.

799
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,680
You're a driver's revenge.

800
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,360
I can't say it.

801
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,840
Luckily, I'm not badly injured.

802
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,960
Please don't blame Jianxi.

803
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,600
I...

804
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,480
She just wanted to be famous

805
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,600
and made the wrong decision.

806
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,240
Anyway,

807
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,400
she's my best friend.

808
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,160
I won't blame her.

809
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,080
I knew it.

810
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,960
Even if I don't bother her,

811
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,520
I'll find her myself.

812
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,640
All right, Zuo.

813
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,720
She's already pitiful enough.

814
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,680
Can you be a little sympathetic?

815
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,520
Dad, she's not your daughter.

816
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,480
She's not anxious.

817
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,320
Why are you so anxious?

818
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,080
All right, let's talk about something else.

819
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,040
Zuo,

820
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,240
eat your meal.

821
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
You're very unruly.

822
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
You're very heartless.

823
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,400
You're a new actress.

824
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
You're struggling with the price.

825
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Do you know what you've done?

826
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,240
I said I didn't do it.

827
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,280
If it weren't for you,

828
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,480
how could Shen Yan get hurt?

829
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,680
You want to tell me

830
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,920
that everyone is lying to you?

831
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,000
Yes, they're all lies.

832
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,440
Why would Shen Yan lie?

833
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,120
He has a doctor's diagnosis.

834
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,480
If he keeps lying,

835
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,160
he'll be in a critical condition.

836
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,440
He's a good man.

837
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,960
He's a good man.

838
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,560
He has a doctor's diagnosis.

839
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,920
If he keeps lying,

840
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,240
he'll be blind today.

841
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,600
Will he hurt himself

842
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,040
to frame you?

843
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,960
Every word he says is a lie.

844
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,880
I haven't hurt anyone.

845
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,160
He wants my role.

846
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Can't you see it?

847
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,720
You're so naive.

848
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,360
With the popularity and popularity of variety shows,

849
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,320
it's all in the news of the night.

850
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,880
Now there's a business case.

851
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,280
Do you really think you can be an actor?

852
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,320
Do you want me to

853
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,080
admit my mistakes?

854
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
The public has been against you.

855
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,920
I want you to take a break.

856
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,280
From now on,

857
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,120
you don't have to come to the company.

858
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,320
Do you hear me?

859
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,520
Go.

860
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,880
Shen Yan.

861
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,840
It's you again.

862
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,000
What are you doing?

863
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,760
It's okay.

864
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,680
You can go.

865
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,400
I can't leave you

866
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,800
to such a vicious woman.

867
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,720
It's okay.

868
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,800
But...

869
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,320
Go to the dressing room.

870
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,560
I want to talk to her alone.

871
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,280
Okay.

872
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,480
If you dare to do anything,

873
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,240
I'll call the police.

874
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,560
There's no one here now.

875
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,720
Can you tell me the truth?

876
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,240
What do you want to know?

877
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,680
Why?

878
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,200
You want to know

879
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,040
why I framed you.

880
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,400
Yes.

881
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,280
I've been thinking for a long time.

882
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,120
I don't understand.

883
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,080
For a role,

884
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,440
you can say that.

885
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,200
Do you have to force me to the end?

886
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,600
You're right.

887
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,320
I only needed a female piano player.

888
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,160
I can give up.

889
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,960
Then why are you

890
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,360
doing this to me now?

891
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,000
Since you have to answer,

892
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,720
I'll tell you.

893
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,000
I was poor and homeless.

894
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,600
I was a waitress at the bar.

895
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,240
I was bullied.

896
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,320
I didn't dare to say anything.

897
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,880
I just told myself,

898
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,000
I have to endure it.

899
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,360
I'll be able to get over it one day.

900
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,200
Then I met you.

901
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,600
Jianxi.

902
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,400
Actually, I used to like you very much.

903
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,520
You worked harder than me.

904
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,560
You forced me to fight for my life.

905
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,360
In order to realize your dream,

906
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,400
you can persist.

907
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,080
Don't say that anymore.

908
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,400
Why?

909
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,600
Because you're so lucky.

910
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm lucky?

911
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,960
Yes.

912
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,520
We're living in the bottom of society.

913
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,680
We're looked down upon.

914
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,600
Why are you being hit

915
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
and you can stand up again and again?

916
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,280
Why can you realize your dream?

917
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,360
I can only be a little assistant.

918
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,120
Ridiculous.

919
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,200
Is that the reason?

920
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,880
Yes.

921
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Even more ridiculous is that

922
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,960
you got me.

923
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,000
You got me.

924
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,800
I've been waiting for you for so long.

925
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,120
What?

926
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,440
Lu Zhu's relationship?

927
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,720
Lu is her.

928
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,400
I want her to care about me.

929
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,760
I want her to like me.

930
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,720
I'm so eager for her every day.

931
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,760
As long as I become as good as you,

932
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,320
she'll look up to me.

933
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,640
But...

934
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,200
But she's not.

935
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,800
Why?

936
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,280
Why can't I be as good as you

937
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,440
in her heart?

938
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,600
I don't believe you.

939
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,760
I must prove to her

940
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,920
that I'm a hundred times better than you.

941
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,800
So you used this despicable trick to win me.

942
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,960
Do you think you can be better than me?

943
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,240
Losing is losing.

944
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,000
Winning is winning.

945
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,160
The fact proves

946
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,280
that I'm better than you,

947
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,240
smarter than you,

948
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,960
and more suitable for this circle.

949
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,000
I really admire you.

950
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,880
You can say such shameless words.

951
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,160
People are all kind and kind.

952
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,720
Now they believe me.

953
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,040
And you?

954
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,920
You're the despicable and shameless person.

955
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,160
What should I do?

956
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,560
They'll never know

957
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,600
that I locked you up in the storage room.

958
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,640
I can't attend the interview.

959
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,280
It's you.

960
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,520
From that moment on,

961
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,040
you're destined to fail.

962
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,480
What?

963
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,560
You must be very sad now.

964
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,280
As a friend,

965
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,840
I can share an experience with you.

966
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,400
If someone claps at you,

967
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,800
you must shout loudly

968
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,000
so that everyone can see your wound.

969
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,400
That's how people will sympathize with you.

970
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,800
If you hold on to it,

971
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,520
no one will look at you.

972
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,200
Because people

973
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,840
only like to pity others in high places.

974
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,160
You gave them a chance,

975
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,400
and you got a chance.

976
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,200
Why not?

977
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,000
You're so disgusting.

978
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,800
Thank you for your compliment.

979
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Wait and see.

980
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,600
I must take everything away from you.

981
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,600
I can't stand being with you.

982
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,800
You have to let me go.

983
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,800
You'll never forgive me.

984
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
I'm sorry.

985
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,600
I'm sorry.

986
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm sorry.

987
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm sorry.

988
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm sorry.

989
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm sorry.

990
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm sorry.

991
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm sorry.

992
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You did wrong again.

993
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,800
Why should I apologize?

994
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,400
I'm doing this for your own good.

995
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,400
I...

996
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,000
Ke Lu.

997
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,600
Don't worry.

998
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,800
Although Jian Xi

999
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,200
did such an ungrateful thing,

1000
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,200
I won't blame him.

1001
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
After all, he helped me once.

1002
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,400
Judging from the past,

1003
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
I will try to forget him.

1004
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,600
Shen Yan.

1005
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,000
By the way,

1006
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm lucky.

1007
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
The doctor told me

1008
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,200
that I didn't get any injuries on my face.

1009
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,400
And the wounds are very shallow.

1010
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,600
I will recover in a month.

1011
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
But Jian Xi,

1012
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,800
I hope you won't do this again.

1013
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
I really feel bad for you.

1014
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,600
Shen Yan.

1015
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,000
Thank you for forgiving Jian Xi.

1016
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,400
Ke Lu, you're crazy.

1017
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,800
I did nothing to him.

1018
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
Jian Xi, it's too late.

1019
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
You still won't admit it?

1020
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You can sneak into the director's room to act.

1021
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
You can hurt your friend to act.

1022
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,800
Wake up, will you?

1023
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,600
You never believed me

1024
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,200
from the beginning.

1025
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,600
I treated you as my best friend.

1026
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,200
But you're like others.

1027
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,800
You were deceived by his weak appearance.

1028
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
I know he forced you to leave.

1029
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,200
In your heart,

1030
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,600
I'm also a kind of greed and humiliation.

1031
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
I'm a woman who doesn't know what to do, right?

1032
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,600
I'm sorry.

1033
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
I'm sorry.

1034
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm sorry.

1035
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
I'm sorry.

1036
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,600
I'm sorry.

1037
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,600
I'm sorry.

1038
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
I'm sorry.

1039
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
I'm sorry.

1040
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
I'm sorry.

1041
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
I'm sorry.

1042
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,600
I'm sorry.

1043
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
I'm sorry.

1044
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
I'm sorry.

1045
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,600
I'm sorry.

1046
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
I'm sorry.

1047
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
I'm sorry.

1048
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm sorry.

1049
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,600
I'm sorry.

1050
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
I'm sorry.

1051
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,600
I'm sorry.

1052
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
I'm sorry.

1053
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
I'm sorry.

1054
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
I'm sorry.

1055
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
I'm sorry.

1056
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
I'm sorry.

1057
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
I'm sorry.

1058
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
I'm sorry.

1059
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
I'm sorry.

1060
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
I'm sorry.

1061
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
I'm sorry.

1062
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
I'm sorry.

1063
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
I'm sorry.

1064
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,600
I'm sorry.

1065
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
I'm sorry.

1066
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
I'm sorry.

1067
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
I'm sorry.

1068
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,600
I'm sorry.

1069
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
I'm sorry.

1070
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
I'm sorry.

1071
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
I'm sorry.

1072
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
I'm sorry.

1073
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
I'm sorry.

1074
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
I'm sorry.

1075
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,600
I'm sorry.

1076
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
I'm sorry.

1077
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
I'm sorry.

1078
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
I'm sorry.

1079
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
I'm sorry.

1080
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
I'm sorry.

1081
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600

1086
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600

1088
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
I'm sorry.

1089

I'm sorry.
