1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far or far away

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, in the second year

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will be a magical eye

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,760
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Hold the weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Use all your strength to fight against the most real you

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
No matter what the little tricks

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,080
No matter what rumors

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,000
I will definitely be invincible

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't care if you are willing

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,320
In the past, I kept the sweet

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
My heart is here

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,120
Even if the world is invincible

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,880
I'm only one you

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Episode 16

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
What is he doing?

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,720
Isn't it a performance?

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Quiet

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,520
Ji Qin has a quiet and harmonious smell

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,920
It seems to be in another world

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,520
A virtuous person

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
As long as he reads quietly

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,520
It's as beautiful as a painting

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Now, after a day of reading

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,520
I can't help but feel the pain

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
I can't help but feel the pain

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
I can't help but feel the pain

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
I can't help but feel the pain

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
I can't help but feel the pain

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
I can't help but feel the pain

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
After a day of waiting

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
Sister Rong Ling is back

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Very good

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Remember this feeling

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
De Ling is like autumn

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,320
Gentle and elegant

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,720
His noble background is not from his birth

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
But the cultivation of the heart

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Yes

52
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Why hasn't Jian Xi come yet?

53
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Director, if Jian Xi gives up

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Can I try to play Rong Ling?

55
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Director, Jian Xi will definitely come

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
He must not be able to grasp the role

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
So he automatically gave up

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Where is Jian Xi?

59
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Tang Fei

60
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Jian Xi locked himself in the room

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Three days and three nights, he didn't eat or drink

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
I don't know if something will happen

63
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Open the door

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
It's locked

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
Jian Xi, open the door

66
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Jian Xi, are you okay?

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
I can't find Rong Ling's feeling

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Look at you now

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
How do you find the feeling?

70
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
Don't look, throw it all away

71
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Come on, get up

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Don't care about me

73
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Be clear, okay?

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Jian Xi

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
What are you doing?

76
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
What are you doing?

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Sun

78
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
It's the feeling of the sun

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Director

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
I remembered all the lines in Rong Ling

81
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Let me try to play it

82
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
Let me try

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Even if it's just once

84
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
I only played one scene

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
I can find someone to replace

86
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Let me try to play Rong Ling

87
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
If it's not good, I'll give up immediately

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Then you go change your clothes

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Thank you, director

90
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Director

91
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
I know

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
I know

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Director

94
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
We found Rong Ling's feeling

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Let her try

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Let me try

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Then try

98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Thank you, director

99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Go

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Go

101
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Go

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Director, what about me?

103
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
If Jian Xi still can't

104
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
You can replace her

105
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
Okay

106
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Why is she back?

107
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Didn't she give up?

108
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Enough, mom

109
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Stop talking

110
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
If you can't do it after half of the shot

111
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Isn't that a waste of time?

112
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
I believe her

113
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Since she's here

114
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
She can play well

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
It's not that easy

116
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Okay, let's go

117
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
24 scenes, one scene, one shot

118
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Action

119
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Why are you laughing?

120
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
What are you laughing at?

121
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Are you acting?

122
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Be quiet

123
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
You're just kicking

124
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
I've never seen a woman like you in the palace

125
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
This is the emperor

126
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Your majesty

127
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Your majesty, you don't know

128
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,920
There are too many rules in the palace

129
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
It's very slow

130
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
So I can only kick the stick to ease the boredom

131
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
You must not tell the ancestors

132
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Otherwise I can't stay in the palace

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
I heard

134
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
You can speak English

135
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
In English

136
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
What do you say in one point and three seconds?

137
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Your majesty, you don't know

138
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
In English, no one says one point and three seconds

139
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
They say two points and one second

140
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Really?

141
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I think you're naughty

142
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Yes

143
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,720
I'm naughty at home

144
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Okay

145
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
I'll call you naughty in the future

146
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Trash

147
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
No

148
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Trash

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
What's wrong with you?

150
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,720
I always say trash when I promise someone

151
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Then mom always scolds me

152
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
She said you always say trash to others

153
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Who do you want to kill?

154
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Do you want to kill your master?

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
How dare you

156
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
It's okay

157
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
You're giving me a name

158
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
You can't just promise

159
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
You have to thank me

160
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Thank you, master

161
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Your name is naughty

162
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
I like it very much

163
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Let me teach you to kick the stick

164
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Come

165
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Let me teach you

166
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Is he stupid?

167
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Isn't the real Rong Ling like this?

168
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Naive and reckless

169
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Didn't you find it?

170
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
When he first appeared

171
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,320
He lit up the whole yard

172
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Cut

173
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Come

174
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Okay, next scene

175
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Director

176
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Am I really over?

177
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
How did you capture Rong Ling?

178
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Sunshine

179
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Sunshine

180
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Happy, passionate

181
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Bright

182
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Like the sun

183
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
As soon as he appears

184
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
The clouds in the Forbidden City will be blown away

185
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Even if the sky falls

186
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
He is also carefree

187
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Director

188
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Although I'm sure this character

189
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
There will be some pressure

190
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
But I will work hard

191
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
Please believe me

192
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Thank you director

193
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Jian Xin

194
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Jian Xin

195
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
You will sit in this position later

196
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I know

197
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Suo Suo

198
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
You sit there

199
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Sit in the front

200
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Ok director

201
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Ok, everyone, hurry up

202
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
The shoot is about to start

203
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
All confirmed

204
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Ok, everyone

205
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Ok

206
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Director Luo

207
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Have you remembered the lines?

208
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Of course I remember

209
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Yan Xi

210
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I think this paragraph is not good

211
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
You follow this line

212
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Editor Mu

213
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
You and Suo Suo

214
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
quarreled

215
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Is it so obvious?

216
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Of course

217
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
On your face

218
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Two words

219
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Do you need me to help you?

220
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
You

221
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
I am Suo Suo

222
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
The most hated person

223
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Is there any inevitable connection?

224
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Sometimes you have to retreat

225
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
The sacred quiet

226
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
I will tell you

227
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,420
I took your hand

228
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,320
What are you doing

229
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
So fierce

230
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
I

231
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
I tell you

232
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
He is mine

233
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
You don't touch it

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
What I said is right

235
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Yes

236
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
What did you say

237
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,320
I say it is yours

238
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I don't believe it

239
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
What did he tell you

240
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,960
What?

241
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,000
Nothing.

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm asking you, what did he say to you?

243
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,240
Nothing.

244
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm going to change the script.

245
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,120
Don't follow me anymore.

246
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,240
Why are you so fierce?

247
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,840
What did he say to you?

248
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,200
I said nothing.

249
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,920
Just say it.

250
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Wait for me.

251
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,680
Here.

252
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,160
Okay.

253
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,040
How is it?

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,600
Is it going well?

255
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,000
It's going well.

256
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,160
Watch your play.

257
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,840
Come on.

258
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,920
I believe you can do it.

259
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,800
Ready to shoot.

260
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,840
Everyone, enter the scene.

261
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,960
Come on, seven o'clock.

262
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,400
Okay, let's start.

263
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,040
Director.

264
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,840
Got it.

265
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,640
Shut up.

266
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,360
Shen Yan.

267
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,560
Ke Lu.

268
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,000
What are you doing here?

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,080
Why are you here?

270
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,360
I just passed by.

271
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,520
I didn't come to see you.

272
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,920
I only have a few scenes.

273
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,080
I don't need to bother you.

274
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,040
Go back to your work.

275
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,280
Let's have dinner together.

276
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,480
What's wrong?

277
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,440
I'll stay here

278
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
to finish the play with you.

279
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,160
It's okay.

280
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,000
We can make an appointment

281
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,640
and have dinner together.

282
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,160
It seems that

283
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,880
you don't want me to stay with you.

284
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
No.

285
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,320
How could it be?

286
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,600
I see that you have been

287
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,400
preparing for the concert.

288
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,560
I'm worried about you.

289
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,360
Since I'm here,

290
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,720
I have to say hello to Jin Xi.

291
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,560
Okay, come on.

292
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,240
Everyone.

293
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,520
Ready to start.

294
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,840
He has started shooting.

295
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,000
Why is he saying hello?

296
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,760
Twenty-three scenes.

297
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,720
Idiot.

298
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,640
Your Majesty.

299
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,360
Sit down.

300
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,840
Sit down.

301
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
What's the matter today?

302
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,920
Nothing.

303
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,520
Then why are you smiling so happily?

304
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,160
I'm happy every day.

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,080
When will you make me osmanthus cake?

306
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,000
The osmanthus cake you make

307
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,280
is the best in the palace.

308
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,280
Wu, you're the best.

309
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,440
I'll come to see you another day.

310
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,600
I'll make you some.

311
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,200
It's not easy.

312
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,040
The last time you taught me to be a western girl,

313
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,800
it was so hard.

314
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,680
Damn it.

315
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,160
Damn it.

316
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,400
Jin Xi.

317
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,000
Come on.

318
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,400
Are you okay?

319
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm fine. How about you?

320
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm fine, too.

321
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,280
Let's get up first.

322
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,400
I'm fine.

323
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,040
Ke Lu.

324
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Your hand is bleeding.

325
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm fine.

326
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,320
Are you okay?

327
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,880
How can he be okay?

328
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
He's bleeding.

329
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
Why are you so stupid?

330
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,680
Why did you come out?

331
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,320
Jin Xi.

332
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,880
Are you okay?

333
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,560
How are you?

334
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,480
I'm fine.

335
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,120
But Ke Lu...

336
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,520
How could the pole fall down?

337
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
I checked it at noon.

338
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,560
It's impossible.

339
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,840
Send someone to

340
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,880
treat his wound.

341
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,240
I'll take you to treat the wound.

342
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,880
Okay.

343
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
Sit down.

344
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,560
Are you scared?

345
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,400
Let's go see him.

346
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,880
Yes.

347
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,760
I'm so scared.

348
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,560
It's weird.

349
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,120
Why did the pole fall down?

350
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,800
Who knows?

351
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,640
Sit here.

352
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,880
Ke Lu, are you okay?

353
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm fine.

354
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,320
I'm fine.

355
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,080
Director.

356
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,240
Leave it to us.

357
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,480
We'll take care of it.

358
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,520
You can go back to work.

359
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,320
Okay.

360
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,680
Others can go back to work.

361
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,440
Have a good rest.

362
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,040
Why did you rush here?

363
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,640
If he didn't rush here,

364
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,240
he would have hit your head.

365
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,960
You're the one who's going to the hospital now.

366
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,680
Are you okay?

367
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,080
I'm fine.

368
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,160
This is all I have.

369
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,840
I'll send you to the hospital first.

370
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,120
It's okay.

371
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,120
We'll go to have dinner after work.

372
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,200
We can go to the hospital first.

373
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,160
Let me help you clean it up.

374
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,680
Why are you still standing here?

375
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,480
I want to see if Ke Lu is really okay.

376
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,680
If it weren't for you,

377
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,720
how could he be okay?

378
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,200
I don't want to see you.

379
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,880
Go away.

380
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,920
No one wants that.

381
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,120
Can you talk to me?

382
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,800
Get out.

383
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,040
Lan Xi.

384
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,680
Ke Lu.

385
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,960
Thank you for today.

386
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
If you need anything,

387
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,240
just call me anytime.

388
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
I'll go to the hospital with you.

389
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,880
Ke Lu.

390
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Thank you.

391
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,680
Take care.

392
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
What kind of person is this?

393
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,840
Why are you so stupid?

394
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
Why did you rush there?

395
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
Jian Xi is my friend.

396
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,480
I'll do this even if she's not my friend.

397
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,080
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

398
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,680
I'm still not thinking about your feelings.

399
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,160
What do you mean?

400
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
When I came to the training class today,

401
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I saw you rush out of there.

402
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,520
Maybe no one noticed your expression.

403
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
But I noticed it.

404
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,520
What do you mean?

405
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,320
Nothing.

406
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,840
Maybe I was just thinking too much.

407
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,480
You're doubting me.

408
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,880
How could I doubt you, Shen Yan?

409
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
You still have feelings for Jian Xi, right?

410
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,040
You're in a panic when you see her injured.

411
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,680
That's not what I mean.

412
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,360
I do envy Jian Xi.

413
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,600
But no matter how much I envy her,

414
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,040
I can't do such a despicable thing.

415
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm not that kind of person.

416
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,840
Shen Yan.

417
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,440
It's my fault.

418
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,320
I shouldn't have doubted you.

419
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,320
The whole world can hate me.

420
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
But you can't.

421
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,800
Why do you doubt me?

422
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,560
It's all my fault.

423
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,840
I'm sorry.

424
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,800
I just saw you injured.

425
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,320
I was scared.

426
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,760
That's why I said something so harsh to her.

427
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,840
I didn't expect you to doubt me like this.

428
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,840
You never trusted me from the beginning to the end.

429
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,360
You...

430
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,640
I'm sorry.

431
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,240
It's all my fault.

432
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't be mad at me, okay?

433
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,960
You'll look ugly when you put on makeup.

434
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,200
But I have to act.

435
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,640
Don't cry, okay?

436
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,160
I came to see you today

437
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,560
just because I picked a good place to eat.

438
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,240
Okay.

439
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,720
Shen Yan.

440
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,760
This is the script that the scriptwriter recently changed.

441
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,280
Take a look.

442
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,040
Jin Xi.

443
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,120
It's normal for things like this to happen in the crew.

444
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,920
Even if there's a problem, it's not managed well by the crew.

445
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,400
But Ke Lu was injured because of me.

446
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,360
We have to go to the hospital with him.

447
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,160
He has a girlfriend. Why do you go?

448
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,720
I still want to go with him.

449
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,280
What if something happens?

450
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,800
Okay.

451
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,160
Look at you.

452
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,840
Okay. I'll go with you.

453
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,400
Okay?

454
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,680
Okay.

455
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,600
Okay.

456
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,120
You asked the scriptwriter to delete my play, right?

457
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,280
What?

458
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,760
I had four plays.

459
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,800
Now I'm half done.

460
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,920
Why should I do such a thing?

461
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,800
Don't always wrong others like this.

462
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,440
If it's not you, who else will it be?

463
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,000
There are only two plays left.

464
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,560
Jin Xi, you're so hard.

465
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
Why do you go to the scriptwriter

466
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,440
and us for such a thing?

467
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,840
You're just lucky.

468
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,720
Rather than saying that it's good luck,

469
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,520
it's better to say that it's related.

470
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,920
If it's not Tang Fei,

471
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,720
will Huang Yu choose you?

472
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,760
I don't want to argue with you.

473
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
This is the first play on the scene.

474
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,200
Don't look down on me.

475
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,280
I know.

476
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
I'm not as popular as you.

477
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,600
But I'm more patient than you.

478
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,400
I'll wait slowly

479
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,160
until the day you fall

480
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,400
from the altar.

481
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,160
What did you say?

482
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,080
I heard a point.

483
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,760
He's more popular than you now.

484
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,360
You're right.

485
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,240
Your face is like a flower.

486
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,240
On the surface,

487
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,480
you look gentle and kind like an angel.

488
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Actually, you look like a devil in your heart.

489
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,560
You must pack yourself well.

490
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,520
Don't show your face if you're all dressed up.

491
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,320
If others see your true self,

492
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,920
maybe the other two plays

493
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,200
will be gone.

494
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,920
You...

495
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,040
There are only two plays left.

496
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,400
You even came to talk to Zhao Lian.

497
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,560
It's not embarrassing.

498
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,520
In this field,

499
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,240
strength is the most important.

500
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,640
He spent all his time

501
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,200
on framing others.

502
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,760
How can he improve his acting skills?

503
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,200
But we have to be careful.

504
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,760
After all,

505
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,160
he's a woman with many means.

506
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
People have limited energy.

507
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,400
Just like before,

508
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,440
I fought with Zuo Zuo for a little thing.

509
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
I almost got kicked out of school by the teacher.

510
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,880
Then I realized

511
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,040
if I put all my attention

512
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,640
on useless things,

513
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll be in trouble.

514
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,920
I'll lose my chance.

515
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,800
Right.

516
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,640
We can't compete with

517
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,080
a small actor who has two plays, right?

518
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,200
Naive.

519
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,720
He pushed his father down the stairs.

520
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,680
And he even framed me.

521
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,880
He came to steal my role

522
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
because he couldn't get the best actress.

523
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,800
This kind of woman

524
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,840
is a beautiful snake.

525
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,720
If she bites you,

526
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,920
she'll eat you.

527
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,400
Are you caring about me?

528
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
I'm not caring about you.

529
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I...

530
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm afraid that

531
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,640
you'll make us shoot again

532
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,080
after you get kicked out.

533
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,880
Zuo Zuo.

534
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,200
It's not a bad thing to care about others.

535
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,920
It's not embarrassing to say it, right?

536
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,080
Why are you looking at me?

537
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,240
I don't have any flowers on my face.

538
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,320
Don't say that.

539
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,640
He's right.

540
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
You'd better not go there in person.

541
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,120
It's not good to meet him.

542
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,600
Buy some fruits for me

543
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,920
and send them to Kele.

544
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,360
To express my apology.

545
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,520
Don't worry.

546
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,320
Let's go.

547
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,160
Didn't you just get a wound?

548
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,120
Why don't you go home and have a good rest?

549
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,280
I did something wrong today.

550
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,880
I'm here to apologize to you.

551
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,680
You don't have to apologize.

552
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,280
I'll never blame you.

553
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,600
Actually,

554
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,680
your suspicion is right.

555
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,240
If it were me,

556
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,920
I would think so.

557
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,040
Shen Yan.

558
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,000
I've always envied Jian Xi.

559
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,800
I've been living a hard life.

560
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,160
I long to be cared by others.

561
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,120
But if it were like Ji Qing,

562
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,800
a princess who grew up in the Wen family,

563
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,240
I wouldn't be jealous at all.

564
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,200
Jian Xi is different.

565
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,760
He's just like me.

566
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,360
Why does everyone like him?

567
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
Jian Xi has suffered a lot of pain.

568
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,280
Yes.

569
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
You're right.

570
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,840
But he stood up.

571
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,360
And he got something better.

572
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,360
What about me?

573
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,240
I've been working hard.

574
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,080
But I'm not talented.

575
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
I'm just Jian Xi's substitute.

576
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,600
Who said you're his substitute?

577
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,000
Isn't it?

578
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,480
From the piano player to the official friend,

579
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
you're all my substitute.

580
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm his substitute.

581
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,800
It's all my fault today.

582
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,320
I've made you sad.

583
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,040
It doesn't matter how others misunderstand me.

584
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,560
Only you.

585
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,320
Only you are different.

586
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,600
I want you to trust me wholeheartedly.

587
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,880
Can you do that?

588
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Okay.

589
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Hello?

590
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,960
Okay.

591
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,240
I have time.

592
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,680
I'll be there soon.

593
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Okay.

594
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,240
Ke Lu.

595
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,560
I have an emergency.

596
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,440
I have to rush there.

597
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,720
I'll send you there.

598
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
No need.

599
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,120
You're injured.

600
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,040
You can't drive.

601
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,240
I'll take a taxi.

602
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Call me.

603
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,080
Help.

604
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,800
Okay.

605
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,300
For the medicine, it's vanilla.

606
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,700
Natural medicine is all basically good for you.

607
00:22:47,700 --> 00:23:13,160
How do you know how to make

608
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Why are you here?

609
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,560
I hurt my hand.

610
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,160
I thought I asked you to go home and rest.

611
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Why didn't you call me when you came?

612
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
I saw it.

613
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
You saw it?

614
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
What did you see?

615
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,160
After I saw the restaurant,

616
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,560
you went to that Osles.

617
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
You followed me?

618
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,960
How could I follow you?

619
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I just saw it so late.

620
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,760
I was afraid you would be alone and not safe.

621
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
I didn't expect that.

622
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Kelo.

623
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
You misunderstood.

624
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,760
I didn't do what you saw with Kelo.

625
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,760
We...

626
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
We were just talking about business.

627
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
You think I'm blind?

628
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,160
How did you get your role?

629
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
I almost forgot.

630
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,960
Kelo invested a lot of money, right?

631
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,160
No, Kelo, you misunderstood.

632
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,760
Why don't you believe me?

633
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Believe you?

634
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Can you change the line next time?

635
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,360
You've fooled me enough.

636
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,560
I...

637
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
I've never fooled you.

638
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,960
Jansi asked me not to believe you.

639
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,560
I regret why I didn't believe her.

640
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,360
I believed you, poor thing.

641
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,360
Kelo.

642
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,960
Jansi is doing well in the crew.

643
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I think so.

644
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
I heard that Director Li is very impressed with her.

645
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,560
She must have fallen asleep by now.

646
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Alright, alright.

647
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
Go back and rest early.

648
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
We have to shoot the sunrise tomorrow morning.

649
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,360
We have to leave early.

650
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Tang Fei.

651
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Tang Fei.

652
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,560
I'm sensitive to your stomach.

653
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Remember to wear more clothes.

654
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Don't eat too much.

655
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,560
Your stomach will be warm.

656
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,160
My heart will be warm.

657
00:25:47,760 --> 00:26:04,920
Your three-leafed

658
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
It's okay.

659
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,560
It's okay.

660
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,560
We have three hours before the next scene.

661
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,560
Come on.

662
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Where are we going?

663
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,960
We're going on a date.

664
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
You're jealous, aren't you?

665
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,360
This is what people live for.

666
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
We're not.

667
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,160
You're so sweet.

668
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,560
You're so annoying.

669
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,160
You're so pitiful.

670
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
I feel sorry for you.

671
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,960
I'm not pitiful.

672
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Basically,

673
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,360
a stupid woman like you

674
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,360
will have no other man

675
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,160
who likes you except me.

676
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,160
A man with a sharp mind

677
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
and a bad heart like you

678
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,560
will probably have no other woman

679
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
who likes you except me.

680
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
Why are you so talkative?

681
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,560
Tang Fei, you scared me.

682
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,560
I'm pushing you down.

683
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,360
Okay, okay.

684
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,160
Stop it.

685
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,960
Let me tell you something.

686
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,160
Let's go see your aunt.

687
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,360
My mom?

688
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,160
She must be lonely

689
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
in the hospital alone.

690
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,360
We can go see her once a week.

691
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,960
You're so impatient

692
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,360
to be her daughter-in-law.

693
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
What?

694
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,160
I don't think so.

695
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,360
Okay, I promise you.

696
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
Next week,

697
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
I'll take the time

698
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,960
to introduce you to my mom.

699
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
I'll tell her

700
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
that you're my girlfriend.

701
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
So soon?

702
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,960
Stop pretending.

703
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,160
You've been thinking about it for a long time.

704
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
What's the point of pretending?

705
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,560
Who's thinking about it?

706
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,960
You're the one who's thinking about it.

707
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,760
Jianxi,

708
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,960
you're really capable.

709
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,360
What do you want to say?

710
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,160
I thought you'd be sad

711
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,960
if you took away Keruo.

712
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
I didn't expect you to find Xia Jia so soon.

713
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
What do you mean Xia Jia?

714
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,360
Don't be so mean.

715
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,360
I've never dated Keruo.

716
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,560
It has nothing to do with me.

717
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,360
Although Keruo is very thin,

718
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,560
she's not as good as Consort Tang.

719
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Everyone knows that

720
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,560
she's rich and powerful.

721
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,160
She's also a major shareholder of Gongyule.

722
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,360
I really have to learn from you.

723
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,760
She looks so pure.

724
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
But her ability to be a high-class person is top-notch.

725
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,760
She chose Consort Tang

726
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,960
because she got love

727
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,760
and power.

728
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,960
Don't think everyone is as powerful as you.

729
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
Aren't you?

730
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,760
I'm not.

731
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,560
Then break up with Consort Tang.

732
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,560
Why?

733
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,760
You've always been

734
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,360
insisting that everything depends on yourself.

735
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,160
Then break up with her right now

736
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,360
and prove it to everyone.

737
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,760
You're sick.

738
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,360
I don't want to talk to the patient anymore.

739
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,560
You should cherish the present.

740
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,360
Because

741
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,960
I'll take everything you have now

742
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,960
and take it all.

743
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,960
Including your beloved

744
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,560
Consort Tang.

745
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,160
You're already hopeless.

746
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
How do you feel?

747
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,160
Pretty good.

748
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,560
Keruo.

749
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
These...

750
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,960
Let me talk to her.

751
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,160
Let's talk.

752
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,560
Call me if you need anything.

753
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,960
Keruo.

754
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,360
How's your injury?

755
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,760
I wanted to see you.

756
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
I didn't come to tell you about this.

757
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,360
You're dating with Consort Tang.

758
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,760
Right?

759
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
The outside world

760
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,760
doesn't know about this?

761
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,160
I understand your concern.

762
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,560
I'm just envious.

763
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,160
Envious?

764
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,560
I like you very much.

765
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,160
But... But I missed the chance.

766
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,960
Keruo.

767
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Jianxi.

768
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,360
I want to know

769
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,160
if when those things happen,

770
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
if I stand by your side firmly,

771
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,760
will you like me?

772
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,560
Stop mentioning it.

773
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,560
It's all in the past.

774
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,960
Right.

775
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,560
It's all in the past.

776
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,560
Did something happen to you?

777
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,160
It's all my fault.

778
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,560
You...

779
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,560
Keruo.

780
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
You should have told me

781
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,960
not to believe Shen Yan.

782
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,360
But you never believed

783
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,560
what I said.

784
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,160
I'm sorry.

785
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
She's your girlfriend.

786
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,360
I went too far.

787
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,960
Go back early.

788
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,360
Because I don't believe it.

789
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,760
Why do you always

790
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,960
put Yanxi in the first place?

791
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
I don't believe it.

792
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,960
I just don't believe it.

793
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
I'm always fighting with myself.

794
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,360
My previous life,

795
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,160
I told myself

796
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,160
since you're not with me,

797
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,760
I can stop loving you.

798
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,160
Even if you tell me again and again

799
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,160
that Shen Yan is a liar,

800
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,360
I don't want to admit it.

801
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,560
Because I know

802
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,360
I don't want to admit defeat.

803
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I don't want to lose my dignity in front of you.

804
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,960
I want to tell you

805
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,160
even if you don't care about me,

806
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
I can still find

807
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,160
a better love.

808
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Keruo.

809
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
You're right.

810
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
It's no use saying these now.

811
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,360
I can't lie to myself anymore,

812
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,160
right?

813
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,760
It's all my fault.

814
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,760
It's not your fault.

815
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,760
Yanxi.

816
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
I want to know

817
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
if these things didn't happen,

818
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,760
would I still have a chance?

819
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,360
I'm sorry.

820
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,960
I drank too much.

821
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,160
I'm leaving now.

822
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Keruo.

823
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,160
No matter when,

824
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,960
I'll treat you as a good friend.

825
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,560
My best friend.

826
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Episode 4

827
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,760
Let me record a song?

828
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,560
Yes.

829
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,760
Director Li and the company have decided

830
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,960
to let you sing the theme song of De Ling and Rong Ling.

831
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,960
Why don't they find a violin?

832
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
There are a lot of violin commercials.

833
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
How can they have time?

834
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,960
I don't have any singing experience.

835
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
What are you afraid of?

836
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,760
The company has already arranged it.

837
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,760
But...

838
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
No buts.

839
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
We've all evaluated it.

840
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
We think your tone is very good.

841
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,260
Besides,

842
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,960
actors nowadays are developing more.

843
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Isn't it good?

844
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Besides, this is an opportunity.

845
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
We have to go.

846
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,160
I...

847
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,760
I'm not here.

848
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,360
Hurry up.

849
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,160
Everyone is waiting for us.

850
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,560
Let's go.

851
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,160
Hey.

852
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,560
I'm not confident.

853
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,160
I said you can do it.

854
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,160
Keruo.

855
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,360
How is it?

856
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
Are you relieved now?

857
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

858
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,560
I told you earlier.

859
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Why are you still here?

860
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,760
I was scared to death.

861
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,560
Don't worry.

862
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,960
I thought I was the only one

863
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,160
singing the theme song.

864
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,760
I heard your voice.

865
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,960
It's not bad.

866
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,360
And the post-production this time

867
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,160
will be great.

868
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Don't worry.

869
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,160
But I...

870
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
No buts.

871
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,760
It's all arranged by the company.

872
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,560
Besides,

873
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,960
you have to believe me.

874
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
I'll call the car.

875
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
Wait for me.

876
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,960
Go back and read the music score.

877
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
If you have any questions,

878
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,360
just ask me.

879
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,360
Okay.

880
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,160
Thank you.

881
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,760
You don't have to be so polite to me.

882
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,560
I hope we can be like before

883
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
and be good friends.

884
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,960
I'm leaving.

885
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,960
Okay.

886
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,560
I'm tired.

887
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,960
I'm going.

888
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,560
Ke Lu.

889
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,560
Can I have a word with you?

890
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,760
Sorry, I'm busy.

891
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,760
You can go.

892
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,960
Ke Lu.

893
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Stop pretending.

894
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,960
Zhen Yan.

895
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,760
Do you want me to tell the truth?

896
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,760
If you hurt anyone else again,

897
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,160
I won't keep it from you.

898
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,760
You broke up with me for Jianshi.

899
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
I won't forgive you.

900
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
This is too much.

901
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
This is too much.

902
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Are you crazy?

903
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Hey, Keluo.

904
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Shen Yan, are you okay?

905
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Keluo, Shen Yan loves you so much.

906
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
You kicked him.

907
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
You are so heartless.

908
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

909
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
It has nothing to do with me.

910
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,760
But I love you.

911
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
We are done.

912
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Keluo.

913
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Keluo.

914
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Keluo, Keluo, don't go.

915
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Keluo.

916
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Jianshi.

917
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Jianshi, I beg you.

918
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Give Keluo back to me, okay?

919
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
Jianshi, I don't know what you are talking about.

920
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
What are you talking about?

921
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
I beg you.

922
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Let me go.

923
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
I beg you.

924
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
What are you doing?

925
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Let me go.

926
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
I am his girlfriend.

927
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Why are you so bad?

928
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
I...

929
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Is it because I stole your role?

930
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Then I will say sorry to you.

931
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
I am sorry, okay?

932
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Let me go.

933
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
Are you crazy?

934
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
If you keep doing this, I will call the police.

935
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Jianshi, you can ask me to do anything.

936
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
As long as you don't bother him anymore.

937
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,760
I don't understand what you are talking about.

938
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
I beg you.

939
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Shen Yan.

940
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
I beg you, okay?

941
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Shen Yan, get up.

942
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
I am not as bad as him.

943
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
I really love him.

944
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
I beg you to give him back to me.

945
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Your relationship with Keluo has nothing to do with me.

946
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Because he likes you.

947
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,760
That's why he abandoned me.

948
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
It's all because of you.

949
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
Because of you.

950
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
Let me go.

951
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Shen Yan, are you crazy?

952
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Shen Yan.

953
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Crazy.

954
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
Shen Yan.

955
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Shen Yan, don't be angry.

956
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
They are too much.

957
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
I am sorry.

958
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Jianshi.

959
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
You will regret it.

960
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
I will let you know.

961
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,760
The price of betrayal.

962
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Shen Yan, don't be sad.

963
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Sit here and have a rest.

964
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
I will get you a glass of water.

965
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Here.

966
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Drink some water.

967
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Put it here.

968
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Shen Yan,

969
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
I won't let you be too mad.

970
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
It's not my fault.

971
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
I will be nice to you.

972
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
Don't be mad.

973
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Let me get some water.

974
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
I will get some water.

975
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Come on.

976
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Drink water.

977
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Put it here.

978
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Shen Yan,

979
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,760
I'll go to the bathroom for a while.

980
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Okay.

981
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Okay.

982
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,880
Shen Yan, don't be sad anymore.

983
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,720
It will all pass.

984
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,120
Thank you.

985
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,840
You go back first.

986
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,000
I'd better stay and stay with you.

987
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,520
I want to be alone.

988
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,480
Okay.

989
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,120
Call me if you need anything.

990
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,920
Class Temporary Conf執行

991
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,120
Action.

992
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,560
Greetings to Your Majesty.

993
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,040
What is this?

994
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,080
Bicycle.

995
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,240
Bicycle?

996
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,160
It's a self-driving car that can move by itself.

997
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,520
Then, how do I move this?

998
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,680
I'll show you.

999
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,840
Okay.

1000
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,520
It really moves.

1001
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,680
What is this?

1002
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,200
It doesn't move.

1003
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,520
Look, it can turn.

1004
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,680
Your Majesty, is it fun?

1005
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,080
This is so interesting.

1006
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,440
Your Majesty, try it too.

1007
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,000
Come on, try it again.

1008
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,960
I can't, Your Majesty.

1009
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,320
It's too dangerous.

1010
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,680
You're right.

1011
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,720
Then you try it.

1012
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,000
I... Your Majesty, I...

1013
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,680
Go ahead.

1014
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,000
Try it.

1015
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,200
I'll teach you.

1016
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,000
The small one is here.

1017
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,280
Be careful of the balance.

1018
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,680
Go.

1019
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,400
You're so stupid.

1020
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,520
You're so stupid.

1021
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,560
Let me try it.

1022
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,440
Okay.

1023
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,280
It's...

1024
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,160
Like this.

1025
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,560
You have to...

1026
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Get on it.

1027
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Step on it.

1028
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,280
One, two, go.

1029
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,280
Be careful, Your Majesty.

1030
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,000
I...

1031
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,320
Your Majesty, you're so good at it.

1032
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
Come on.

1033
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,680
Your Majesty, be careful.

1034
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,880
Come here.

1035
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,440
Actually, it's easy.

1036
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,760
Your Majesty, you're so good at it.

1037
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,520
Come on.

1038
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,760
Take me to ride it.

1039
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,520
Okay.

1040
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,360
Come on.

1041
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,920
Your Majesty.

1042
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,400
Be careful, Your Majesty.

1043
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,720
Sit tight.

1044
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,760
Be careful.

1045
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,840
Be careful, Your Majesty.

1046
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,000
Let's go.

1047
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,280
Let's go.

1048
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,480
Let's go.

1049
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,240
Let's go.

1050
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Be careful, Your Majesty.

1051
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,120
Be careful.

1052
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,960
Be careful.

1053
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,680
Let's go.

1054
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,840
Your Majesty, be careful.

1055
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,800
Cut.

1056
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,600
Okay, next scene.

1057
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,880
Director.

1058
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,120
What did I do just now?

1059
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,520
Do I need to do it again?

1060
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,440
You've mastered Rong Ling completely.

1061
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,000
Thank you, Director.

1062
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,640
Okay.

1063
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,200
Come on.

1064
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,440
The next scene we'll shoot is

1065
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,920
the scene where Rong Ling dances.

1066
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,800
Although we've asked a professional teacher to teach you,

1067
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,200
the youthful energy in Rong Ling

1068
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,960
needs your help to protect it.

1069
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,000
I want the kind of relaxed,

1070
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,240
emotional,

1071
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,920
not a show that requires a lot of effort.

1072
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,840
Do you understand?

1073
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
I understand.

1074
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Where's Shen Yan?

1075
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,920
We'll shoot him and Guang Xu later.

1076
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,520
Director.

1077
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,320
Oh, no, Director.

1078
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,520
Why are you so scared?

1079
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,120
Shen Yan.

1080
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,760
What?

1081
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,440
Shen Yan.

1082
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,360
Shen Yan committed suicide.

1083
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,120
Suicide?

1084
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,480
There's a self-making signing event this afternoon.

1085
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,920
It's at four o'clock in the afternoon.

1086
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,080
Then we'll go...

1087
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,440
Wait.

1088
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,280
Shen Yan, the famous actress who played the real consort in this drama,

1089
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,760
has been admitted to the hospital recently.

1090
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,120
According to reliable news,

1091
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,000
she's been admitted to the hospital

1092
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,680
because she broke up with her ex-boyfriend,

1093
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,720
and it seems that she's been hurt by love.

1094
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,040
The reporter contacted her agent,

1095
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,080
but there's no news yet.

1096
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,480
The director hasn't revealed

1097
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,480
whether he'll change the actress.

1098
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,120
We'll keep following up.

1099
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,720
It's my turn.

1100
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,600
Stop.

1101
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,240
Miss Shen.

1102
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,000
It's said that you committed suicide.

1103
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,760
Is it true?

1104
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,360
What's wrong with your relationship with Kolo?

1105
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,920
Miss Shen.

1106
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,760
There's a fierce conflict between you and Jinxin at the company gate.

1107
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,640
Did Jinxin get involved with your third party?

1108
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,760
Everyone.

1109
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,720
Shen Yan just got discharged from the hospital.

1110
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,800
Please don't make it hard for him.

1111
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,720
Please tell us, Miss Shen.

1112
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,920
It's true.

1113
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:41,140
przykład

1114
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:50,120
upgrade

1115
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,520
你知道

1116
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
I'm afraid that I'll be hurt

1117
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,520
Tonight the moonlight shines on my friendship

1118
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:06,520
With loneliness and my endless loyalty

1119
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,520
Watching the prosperity and prosperity

1120
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Watching loneliness turn into frost

1121
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
Watching the tide rise and fall

1122
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,520
The people are warm, the sky is dark and the sky is bright

1123
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
Too much hope

1124
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,520
In the end, you become desperate

1125
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
Watching you come and go

1126
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,520
Hugging you tightly and everything is in a trance

1127
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,520
Too stubborn to be young

1128
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,520
There is a lie that never forgets the fire

1129
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,520
Looking back, there will always be regrets

1130
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,520
You and I, we are gradually lost on the road

1131
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:02,520
The typhoon is going to blow everything away

1132
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:08,520
Where is the new red sea going to hit?

1133
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,520
Just like this, wait until dawn

1134
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,520
Just like this, wait for the dawn

1135
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:28,520
Just like this, wait until dawn
