1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Miss you

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Love you

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who you are

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
At that moment

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
A long age

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,240
Turned into a magical eye

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,920
Pass through the loneliness to find you

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,040
Wear the most solid gold armor

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,920
Hold the weapon in your hand

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Use all your strength to fight for the most real self

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the little tricks

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what rumors

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,080
I will definitely be invincible

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't want you to be willing

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,720
Where is the gold?

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,440
In the past, I kept this sweet

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,760
No matter where your heart is

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,080
My heart is here

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
Even if the world is invincible

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,440
It's just one

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Episode 16

30
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Ji Qin, please have afternoon tea

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Here, Tang Fei

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Thank you

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Thank you

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Here, Ji Qin, please have afternoon tea

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Thank you, Ji Qin

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Why are you here so early today?

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
I came to see how you are doing

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Didn't you shoot the last farewell today?

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Xiaoxiao, script

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
You give this to Jansi

41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Tang Fei, I want to ask

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
Look at this place

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Will the old woman's uncle be more reasonable?

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
You two

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Thank you

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
I think it's okay

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Thank you for what?

48
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Not bad

49
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
It's a good thing

50
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
Do you have to make others unhappy?

51
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Did I say something wrong?

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Lan Xi

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Don't worry, I won't fight with a thick-skinned person

54
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Thick-skinned? Who are you talking about?

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
I've heard of saving money

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
I haven't heard of saving money

57
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
You don't drink?

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
If you don't drink, you don't drink

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
You sent it yourself

60
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
Who likes to drink?

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Lan Xi

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
I'm not angry with her

63
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
What is it?

64
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Just an assistant of a thick-skinned person

65
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
She is just a mouthful

66
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Not bad

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
It's okay, it's okay

68
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
It's okay

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
What's wrong with you?

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Are you uncomfortable?

71
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
I also suddenly have a little pain

72
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Do I want to buy you some medicine?

73
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
It's okay

74
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
It's an old problem

75
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Just take a break

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
You have to shoot the rain scene later

77
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
How can I hold on?

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Everyone is ready

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
Don't bother everyone

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Finish this scene first

81
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
How about this? I'll pour you some hot water to drink

82
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
Okay?

83
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Ready

84
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Action

85
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Baojun

86
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,440
I know you can hear

87
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Open the door for me, okay?

88
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Baojun

89
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
I know I wasn't brave enough before

90
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm not persistent enough

91
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Give me another chance

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Can you give me another chance?

93
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Baojun

94
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
What's wrong with you?

95
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Are you uncomfortable?

96
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
You are sick

97
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
It's the cut-off

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
The cut-off is uncomfortable

99
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Wasn't he fine just now?

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
What's wrong with him?

101
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
I have a stomachache

102
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
This kid is very stubborn

103
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
It's okay, you don't have to worry about it

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Actors are busy shooting the day and night

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Can't afford three meals

106
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
Stomachache

107
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
It's a very common thing

108
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm worried he can't stand it

109
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Anyway, as long as he thinks it's okay

110
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
There must be no problem

111
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Don't worry, okay?

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
What do you know?

113
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Don't guess what the girl is thinking

114
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Baojun

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Open the door, Baojun

116
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Baojun

117
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
Go out and see him

118
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Open the door, Baojun

119
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
I've said everything I should say

120
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Nothing to say

121
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Baojun

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
If you don't go to see him

123
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Please

124
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
He will stay until dawn tomorrow

125
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Open the door

126
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Even if you don't see him

127
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Tomorrow's disaster relief meeting will also meet

128
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Don't treat me like this

129
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
No

130
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
I will never see you again in my life

131
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Baojun

132
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Leave here with me

133
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Baojun

134
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Leave with you

135
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Yes, with me

136
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Since the first day I saw you

137
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
I fell in love with you

138
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
I also swore on the case

139
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,440
I must pull you into my arms

140
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Otherwise, I'm not Gu Yunsheng

141
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
I've been waiting for four years

142
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Baojun

143
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
This vow has finally been fulfilled

144
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
I will not marry you

145
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
Baojun

146
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Baojun

147
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Okay, cut

148
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
What are you two acting?

149
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Can you do it?

150
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
I said, Jianxi

151
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
You are too cold-hearted

152
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Yu Yaojun doesn't dislike Shen Lan

153
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
He loves her too much

154
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
It's all because of despair, you know

155
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
So I need you to show extremely

156
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,440
The feeling of suppressing your excitement

157
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Just that kind

158
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
You think about it

159
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Despair, you know

160
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
That kind of excitement

161
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
You know

162
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
I'm sorry

163
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm sorry

164
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
I'm sorry

165
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Despair, you know

166
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
That kind of excitement

167
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
What are you doing?

168
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
He is sick, he can't be in the hospital

169
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Don't worry, director

170
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
You are his agent

171
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
You should respect his opinion

172
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
I am his agent

173
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
I am his friend

174
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Don't be emotional, okay?

175
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Then I am such a person

176
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
If you really know him

177
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
You should know that you can't stop him

178
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Let's do it again

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Okay, do it again

180
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Okay, do it again

181
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Okay

182
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Jianxi

183
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Jianxi

184
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
What's going on?

185
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Go drive, take him to the hospital

186
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Okay

187
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Hurry, go

188
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Tang Fei

189
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
What's going on?

190
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Yes

191
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
What's going on?

192
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Tang Fei

193
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Tang Jian

194
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
You know you are sick

195
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
And you need to be on standby

196
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Do you know that

197
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
This will delay

198
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
The progress of the whole crew

199
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
If you are sick

200
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Just stay at home

201
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
And let me take care of you

202
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
You are strong

203
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,440
But people will hate you more

204
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
I'm sorry

205
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
I'm sorry

206
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
I'm sorry

207
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I'm sorry

208
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
I'm sorry

209
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm sorry

210
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
I'm sorry

211
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm sorry

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
I'm sorry

213
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
I'm sorry

214
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
I'm sorry

215
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Until you get it wrong

216
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Until you get it wrong

217
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
You have to change next time

218
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
You don't want everyone to worry about you

219
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
You don't want everyone to worry about you

220
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Why do you look at me like this?

221
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Here

222
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
What do you want to say to me?

223
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,860
For taking care of princess Qingyi!

224
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,580
But why

225
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,940
Are you leaving now?

226
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,480
I'll go.

227
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,720
You see?

228
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,720
Your girlfriend is in the relationship

229
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,160
between you and this man…

230
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,080
Yuan activists suffer!

231
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
I know you're not asleep.

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Listen to me carefully.

233
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Listen to what I'm saying.

234
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Love is like stomachache.

235
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
The more you endure it,

236
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
the more it hurts.

237
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
No matter how good the air is,

238
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
you can't hide it.

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
So don't listen to others.

240
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Respect your heart.

241
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
You will know that you should leave.

242
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
You will know that you should leave.

243
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
You will know that you should leave.

244
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Yanxi.

245
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Director.

246
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
How are you feeling?

247
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Much better.

248
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Great.

249
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
We care about you.

250
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
By the way,

251
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
today is the last scene of our play.

252
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
It's also Yu Yaojun's solo play.

253
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Look, you left Shanghai with Gu Yingsheng.

254
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
But you didn't stay with him.

255
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
You chose to sing alone.

256
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
You didn't get married.

257
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
After the plot developed for many years,

258
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Shen Lan asked to see you again.

259
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
After you heard the news from the servants,

260
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,440
you cried with sadness.

261
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
I cried with sadness?

262
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
You want to show the character's

263
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,440
indecision and sorrowful mood.

264
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Director.

265
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Can I play this scene by myself?

266
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Play by yourself?

267
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Yes.

268
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
I want to try.

269
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Okay.

270
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
You can do it.

271
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Thank you, director.

272
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Okay.

273
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
All the parts are ready.

274
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Ready.

275
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Action.

276
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Director.

277
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
He didn't play the role.

278
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Let him play by himself.

279
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Okay.

280
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Madam.

281
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Mr. Shen insists on seeing you.

282
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
He said

283
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
he wants to see you.

284
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
He said he wants to see you.

285
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
He said he wants to see you.

286
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
He said he wants to see you.

287
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
He said he is old.

288
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Maybe it's the last time we meet.

289
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Let him go back.

290
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Madam.

291
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Do you want to sing another song?

292
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Where is the zither?

293
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Isn't the zither there?

294
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,440
How can I sing without the zither?

295
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Madam.

296
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
The zither is there.

297
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
The zither

298
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
is gone.

299
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Okay.

300
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Cut.

301
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Let's go.

302
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Jianxi.

303
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Director.

304
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
I think we should discuss this part.

305
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Your performance and the plot are too big.

306
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Director.

307
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,440
But I think Jianxi played it right.

308
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Why?

309
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
Because I think

310
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
the plot of the play is too big.

311
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
I think the plot of the play is too big.

312
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
I think the plot of the play is too big.

313
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Jianxi,

314
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,440
how do you feel now because What kind of management you are holding?

315
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
I'm an adult.

316
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
What kind of management are you having?

317
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Sheng Zhenyu said you work fast.

318
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Yes.

319
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,240
replicate after you упyette.

320
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
How do you feel now?

321
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,440
I feel happy now.

322
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
I feel happy now.

323
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Even if the zither is deep, I must be able to cut it off.

324
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,320
Even if people say it's delicious, I must keep my dignity.

325
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,320
I think this is the real Yu'ao Jun.

326
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,600
But don't forget,

327
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
your family still has Shen Lan's photo.

328
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,920
In the vending machine, there is the farewell of the king.

329
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,280
Have you really forgotten it?

330
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,840
Yes.

331
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
I will never forget it.

332
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,520
When I look back,

333
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,320
there is only a heart-full of sorrow.

334
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
I won't cry anymore.

335
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,320
Because the zither has been broken,

336
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,880
and the tears have dried up.

337
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,160
Let me think about it.

338
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,160
It makes sense for you to say that.

339
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,800
Director,

340
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
if that's the case,

341
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,200
can we finish it?

342
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,200
Okay.

343
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,960
Okay.

344
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,120
Thank you all for your hard work.

345
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Everyone, finish it.

346
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,680
That's great.

347
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,360
Thank you.

348
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,920
Thank you.

349
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,840
Thank you, director.

350
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank you.

351
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,040
Yanxi.

352
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,120
Thank you, director.

353
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,840
Thank you, director.

354
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,160
That's great.

355
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,920
Thank you, everyone.

356
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,520
There are people over here.

357
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,360
Come on.

358
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,040
Good.

359
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,480
Yanxi.

360
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,640
There is a wedding banquet tonight.

361
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,280
Don't be late.

362
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,720
Don't worry.

363
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,680
We will be there on time.

364
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,480
Okay.

365
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,480
Yanxi.

366
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,000
Let's go home and rest.

367
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,800
What's wrong with you?

368
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,840
You should rest when you should.

369
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,120
You shouldn't rest when you shouldn't.

370
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,720
Why?

371
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,360
I don't like that kind of occasion.

372
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,600
You can't say that.

373
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,320
You are a girl.

374
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Can you not show up?

375
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,760
But...

376
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,520
No buts.

377
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,480
Don't say that.

378
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,720
It will be bad if it gets out.

379
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,520
You must go.

380
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,040
Then I will ask my teacher.

381
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,120
Don't ask him.

382
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,880
He doesn't like that kind of place.

383
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,040
It's like you didn't ask him.

384
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,000
You can have fun tonight.

385
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,560
Be happy.

386
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,320
That's it.

387
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Clean up.

388
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Make yourself pretty.

389
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,400
Come on.

390
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,120
Take a picture.

391
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
Cheers.

392
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,040
Good wine.

393
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,840
Thank you, Meidao.

394
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,280
Come on.

395
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Congratulations, Meidao.

396
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,120
Congratulations, Meidao.

397
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,280
Thank you, Meidao.

398
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,080
Meidao, you have worked hard.

399
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,920
Meidao, you have worked hard.

400
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,960
We are also working hard.

401
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
We are working hard.

402
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,440
Come on.

403
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,280
Let's walk a little.

404
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There are so many people.

405
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,600
Over there.

406
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,080
Let's go.

407
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,800
Come on.

408
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,080
I heard that

409
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,360
there are more and more people coming to your place.

410
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,800
Is it okay?

411
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,200
Yes.

412
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,760
I'm lying here.

413
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,320
The board of the tour is not bad.

414
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,480
What are you doing?

415
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,520
Let's sit here.

416
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,280
They are all sitting over there.

417
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,480
Why are we sitting here?

418
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
There are too many people over there.

419
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,240
It's too noisy.

420
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,520
I think we should sit here.

421
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,240
They are all sitting over there.

422
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,720
You forgot what we are doing.

423
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,120
Let's go.

424
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,480
Listen to me.

425
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,840
I don't want to go.

426
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,320
Finish what you should do.

427
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,720
Come on.

428
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,120
I...

429
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:23,760
Listen to me.

430
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,160
I really don't want to go.

431
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,960
I mean it.

432
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,400
I think this school is not bad.

433
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,360
We can develop our own

434
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,440
in the future.

435
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,840
Director Mei.

436
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,960
We are here.

437
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,560
Let's sit here.

438
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,800
Jianshi.

439
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,280
Come on.

440
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Is Jianshi a good person in the drama?

441
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,920
Of course.

442
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,960
We should use her next time.

443
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,680
We will.

444
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,400
Definitely.

445
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Come on.

446
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,080
I toast to you, Director Mei.

447
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,360
Happy cooperation.

448
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,000
Cheers.

449
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,520
Cheers.

450
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,840
Fei.

451
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,400
When will the next play begin?

452
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,640
Our Fei's next play

453
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,720
is to make a movie with our Ji Qin He.

454
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,480
It's called The Love of Qingcheng.

455
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,880
The Love of Qingcheng.

456
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,160
Why is the name so vulgar?

457
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
What did you say?

458
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,720
I said why is the name so vulgar?

459
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,640
Are you filming a story about the countryside?

460
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,200
Take a break.

461
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,040
Anxin.

462
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,720
We are a big production.

463
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,120
Some people can't make it if they want to.

464
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,760
You are jealous again.

465
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,000
Can you stop

466
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,320
looking at your eyes?

467
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,640
Your eyeballs are almost on the ground.

468
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,440
I envy you.

469
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,280
I don't want to make a movie

470
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,320
that makes me tired.

471
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,000
Fei.

472
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,760
When will you and Ji Qin

473
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,040
send sugar to the others?

474
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Yes.

475
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,960
What do you know?

476
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
They must have been engaged.

477
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,760
You know,

478
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,240
Ji loves his daughter so much.

479
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,600
How could he get married so easily?

480
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,160
Right.

481
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,960
Last time,

482
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,800
I saw Fei at the jewelry store.

483
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,400
He must have gone to buy diamond rings.

484
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,040
So sweet.

485
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,880
Yes.

486
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,960
And he even goes to the hospital to see Ji Qin every day.

487
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,320
You said it's okay.

488
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,200
Yes.

489
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,120
If you are good friends,

490
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,600
how can you be so close?

491
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,320
Ji Qin.

492
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,240
Ji Qin, tell me.

493
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,040
Then, don't be a celebrity.

494
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,600
Be a reporter, okay?

495
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,560
Don't be so stingy.

496
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Yes.

497
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,160
I'm just kidding.

498
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,960
Don't be stingy.

499
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,120
I'm a little tired today.

500
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,800
I'll go first.

501
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,920
He's leaving again.

502
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,720
Ji Xin.

503
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,360
Ji Xin.

504
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,000
So boring.

505
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Right.

506
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,520
Why does he always

507
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,880
stay out of the show?

508
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
What's wrong with him?

509
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,400
Mei.

510
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,280
He's so lucky.

511
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,400
Jian Xu is too tired recently.

512
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Let him go back and rest.

513
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,520
I'll drink with you.

514
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,280
It's really hard.

515
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,320
Let's go.

516
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,640
Come on.

517
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,160
Come on.

518
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,920
Let's drink.

519
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,600
Cheers.

520
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
He's going home

521
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,200
after the hot pot party.

522
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,720
Yes.

523
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,920
He's playing hard to get.

524
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
Why is Jian Xu like this?

525
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,400
So many rumors.

526
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,640
He should be more open.

527
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,880
He's a weirdo.

528
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,320
Come on.

529
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,480
Come on.

530
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,320
Let's drink.

531
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,720
Right.

532
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,240
Let's drink.

533
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,720
It's okay.

534
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,120
Come on.

535
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,880
Let's drink.

536
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,120
Cheers.

537
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,800
Cheers.

538
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,320
Cheers.

539
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,000
Cheers.

540
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
Miss, are you okay?

541
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm fine.

542
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,640
Anxin asked me to bring you this.

543
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,320
Actually, I've thought about it these days.

544
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,160
Let's be friends.

545
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,600
But this circle is really small.

546
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,480
We can't meet face to face.

547
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,680
What if we work together again?

548
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,160
You said we can't talk when we meet.

549
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,840
We should be more open.

550
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,600
Right?

551
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,320
Right.

552
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,000
Right.

553
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,600
Right.

554
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,320
Right.

555
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,960
Right.

556
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,560
Right.

557
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,280
Right.

558
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,880
Right.

559
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,400
Right.

560
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,080
Right.

561
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,640
Right.

562
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,160
Right.

563
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,680
Right.

564
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,320
Right.

565
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,920
Right.

566
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,680
Right.

567
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,480
Right.

568
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,200
For sweetie pie.

569
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,240
Was I 50?

570
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,360
I don't need to be 50.

571
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,640
I'm really well-off.

572
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,400
What about Yuwen Lin?

573
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,280
Is he still in the Ji 막ia guys?

574
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,360
How can you say so?

575
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,440
Those areUNKNOWN.

576
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I think what you mean

577
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,680
is we don't have to talk all the time.

578
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,920
You know that.

579
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,360
I don't understand.

580
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,560
We don't stand home and do nothing.

581
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,560
We act this way.

582
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
I have something important to tell you.

583
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Is that really the case?

584
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Are you crying?

585
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
I'm not crying.

586
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Yes, I'm not a mature person.

587
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,560
I'm the kind of person who can write whatever she wants on her face.

588
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,560
I've already worked very hard,

589
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,560
I've already worked very hard to pretend that I have nothing to do with you.

590
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
They're right.

591
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Ji Qin is the most suitable person for you.

592
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
She's pretty and gentle.

593
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,560
What about me? I'm stupid, stupid and ridiculous.

594
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
I'm nothing compared to her.

595
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
And...

596
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
I'm not going to be your friend.

597
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Why?

598
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Because...

599
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,560
I...

600
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
I still like you.

601
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,560
What are you meidän is...?

602
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
You're in my heart?

603
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,240
I couldn't believe that you were Eagle Plus,

604
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
why do you...

605
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,900
You only bicycles,

606
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
What I said just now,

607
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
is not true.

608
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
What you said just now,

609
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
you won't take it back, right?

610
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
What did you say?

611
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
You said you like me.

612
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
I won't take it.

613
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,900
Then I'll ask you,

614
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
why did you run away?

615
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
They said you already bought the ring.

616
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
You already bought it for Ji Qing.

617
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
Did you see it?

618
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
I went to that kind of place

619
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
to buy this necklace.

620
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
The only person I love in my heart

621
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
is you.

622
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
I've never loved anyone else.

623
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
You won't take it off again, right?

624
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
It depends on your performance.

625
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Does it still hurt?

626
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
It hurts.

627
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
It still hurts?

628
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
Then drink some medicine.

629
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
I don't want to drink today.

630
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
Drink some.

631
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
If you're so painful, I'll really worry about you.

632
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
I don't want to drink today.

633
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
Your health is important.

634
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Then you give me a bath.

635
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Okay.

636
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Good morning.

637
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
You look in a good mood.

638
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
What kind of script do you want to see in the future?

639
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Am I qualified to choose?

640
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
Usually, the characters come to pick me.

641
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Come, come, come, look.

642
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
What?

643
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
You're in love?

644
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
You introduced it.

645
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
Then this is for you.

646
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
For me?

647
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,900
Yes.

648
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
You are my only one.

649
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
You won the global movie

650
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
public welfare love award.

651
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,900
These are all gifts from fans.

652
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Are you happy?

653
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Really? Of course it's real.

654
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,900
Do you know?

655
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
When the movie was released,

656
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,900
I got a lot of ads.

657
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
But I've already paid for it.

658
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
Do you know why?

659
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
Because now, it's not others picking us,

660
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
it's us picking others.

661
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Really? Of course.

662
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Let's go to battle.

663
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Where to battle?

664
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Qi Wen Sen later

665
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,900
doesn't know what to ask you for.

666
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,900
But no matter what he sends you,

667
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
you have to return it all.

668
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
Why? Because you have to give him some color.

669
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,900
You can be a good actress.

670
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
That's not good.

671
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Nothing is bad.

672
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
Remember what I said.

673
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
All of it.

674
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,900
No more.

675
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Let's go.

676
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Mr. Qi, today's audition is still in the process.

677
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
We don't have much time.

678
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
I know he's busy.

679
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
You have to see him.

680
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Let me introduce.

681
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
This is Director Li.

682
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Director Li.

683
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
I really like your movie.

684
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
Jian Xi, let me introduce.

685
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
This is the famous director Li Hong.

686
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
His movie is in the Venice International Film Festival.

687
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
He won the best director and the best screenwriter.

688
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
He's the director of the movie.

689
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Director Li.

690
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,900
Hello.

691
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Let's sit down and talk.

692
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Please.

693
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Miss Jian.

694
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
I want to invite you to act in my movie.

695
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,900
Me?

696
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,900
But...

697
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,900
Director Li, you have a good taste.

698
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
Our film is great.

699
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Do you want to see the script?

700
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,900
We'll take any role.

701
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,900
Director Li.

702
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,900
Thank you for giving us this opportunity.

703
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
We will do our best to play this role.

704
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,900
Thank you.

705
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Why are you laughing like this?

706
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
Who made you laugh?

707
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
It's a matter of life and death.

708
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Li Hong.

709
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Did you see Qin Wen Sen's expression?

710
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
So happy.

711
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,900
I've never seen you so excited.

712
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,900
Do you know?

713
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Many people want to go to Li Hong's movie.

714
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,900
But he chose us.

715
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,900
I'm so happy.

716
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Drive carefully.

717
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
You're so excited that your eyes are closed.

718
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
You're the one who's holding me.

719
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,900
So I'm in a good mood.

720
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
I mean it.

721
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
You must believe me.

722
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,900
After you play Li Hong's movie,

723
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
you will be famous.

724
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
I don't know what role it is.

725
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,900
It doesn't matter.

726
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900
We'll play it well.

727
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
De Lin.

728
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,900
He was born in the capital.

729
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
He came from abroad.

730
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,900
He came back to the country at the age of 17.

731
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
He speaks many languages.

732
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
He was recruited by Zi Xi.

733
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
He became a pre-eminent official.

734
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Here you are.

735
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Let me introduce.

736
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
This is the film writer, Mu Ge.

737
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
This is...

738
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Leader, we're old friends.

739
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
Leader, come in.

740
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
Sit down.

741
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Why is he here?

742
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
Zuo Zuo.

743
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
I don't want to play with him.

744
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
Did you forget what I told you?

745
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,900
Actors need to cooperate with anyone.

746
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
I don't care if you're so willful.

747
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Zuo.

748
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
Zuo Zuo.

749
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Can we start?

750
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
One more is not here.

751
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Who?

752
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Director Li.

753
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Aren't you shooting the movie, The Love of My Life?

754
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Yes.

755
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
But he had a car accident.

756
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,900
So he was delayed for three months.

757
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
So he came here.

758
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
Since everyone is here,

759
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
let's talk about the script.

760
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,900
The leading actress is De Lin and Rong Lin.

761
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,900
Please introduce the screenplay.

762
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Okay.

763
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
The story happened in the time of Lie Qiang's pregnancy.

764
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
Empress Dowager Zi Xi knew Yu Geng's daughter

765
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,900
was pregnant.

766
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
So she asked De Lin and Rong Lin to join the palace.

767
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
She was a translator.

768
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,900
They lived in the old Qinghuang Palace

769
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
in a fashionable suit.

770
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
It was the first time they introduced modern dance and ballet to China.

771
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,900
It was the first time they taught porcelain painting and portrait painting.

772
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
It was also the first time

773
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,900
they used the female identity to win the favor of the strong.

774
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
It brought a fresh atmosphere

775
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
to the old Qinghuang Palace.

776
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
So it's a wonderful story

777
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
that's different from the old times.

778
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,900
So, Director Li,

779
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,900
is our Jansi not De Lin's?

780
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,900
De Lin's role

781
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
is played by Ji Qing.

782
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
I play De Lin.

783
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Rong Lin's role is played by Jansi.

784
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
Director Li, are you kidding me?

785
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
I said before that

786
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Jansi is De Lin's role.

787
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,900
And Ji Qing is Rong Lin's role.

788
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,900
Yes. De Lin's play is very complicated.

789
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
I'm suitable for this role.

790
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,900
And when Director Qi talked to me before,

791
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
he asked me to play Rong Lin.

792
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,900
So I play Rong Lin.

793
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,900
This is my decision.

794
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
But, Director,

795
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
as an actress, you should play various roles easily.

796
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
Right?

797
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,900
Zuo Zuo plays the empress of Guangxu, Jin Fen.

798
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,900
Director Li, what about me?

799
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
You play Zhen Fei.

800
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
Zhen Fei?

801
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Zhen Fei only exists in Guangxu's memory.

802
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
There are only a few scenes.

803
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
I'm not a director who lets investors do nothing.

804
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
If you don't want to,

805
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,900
you can't.

806
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,900
I'm not a director.

807
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
I can only help you.

808
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,900
If you want to play Rong Lin,

809
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,900
you can play him.

810
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,900
I'll help you.

811
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
You can't play him.

812
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
You must play him.

813
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,900
I won't play him.

814
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Zuo Zuo is not my character.

815
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,900
I'm not a director.

816
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,900
I'm a good actor.

817
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
I'm not a good actress.

818
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
Zuo Zuo is not my character.

819
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,780
I just don't understand.

820
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,620
What don't you understand?

821
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,300
What do you think about Director Li?

822
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,860
He totally messed up our plan.

823
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,860
Jian Xi is always good at creating complicated characters.

824
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,220
What's the point of this silly girl?

825
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,700
What's silly?

826
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,900
It's called being naive and romantic, okay?

827
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,380
That's silly.

828
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,620
I'm not silly.

829
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,940
I'm just convinced.

830
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,300
Jian Xi.

831
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,820
I think Ji Qin is more suitable for this role.

832
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,100
How about we change with him?

833
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,900
Didn't Director Li say that he has made up his mind?

834
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,900
But I don't think you're suitable for this role.

835
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,700
Rong Lin is naive and romantic.

836
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,780
He's passionate.

837
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,140
Jian Xi has never played a similar role.

838
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,660
This role is like a blank paper.

839
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,500
I don't know how to draw it.

840
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,940
Look.

841
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,940
The light of the night.

842
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,580
I hope you can integrate into Rong Lin's life.

843
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,140
Only then can you understand her.

844
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,260
Integrate into Rong Lin's life?

845
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,620
Or what do you want to change?

846
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,140
We live in the same environment.

847
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,380
But Rong Lin and De Ling are different.

848
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,860
Rong Lin is younger than her.

849
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,540
So she's been favored by her parents.

850
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,620
She's not like De Ling.

851
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,620
De Ling is strict with her.

852
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,860
She's gentle and introverted.

853
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,940
I've never been favored.

854
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,420
How do I know what it feels to be favored?

855
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,180
Are you trying to tell me something?

856
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,260
Of course.

857
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,780
What is it?

858
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,260
I'm sorry.

859
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,860
Are you trying to trick me?

860
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,260
Little beauty.

861
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,940
This girl.

862
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,860
Here.

863
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,060
You two try it first.

864
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,220
Take me as a magnet.

865
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,620
Walk two steps in front of me.

866
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,820
From here to there?

867
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,500
Yes.

868
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,060
Don't forget to match the identities of the two sisters.

869
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,860
Stop dawdling.

870
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,660
Hurry up.

871
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,420
You go first.

872
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,260
She's so elegant.

873
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,020
Yes.

874
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,460
Look at her walking in shoes.

875
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,660
She's so professional.

876
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,180
She knew it was a mistake at first sight.

877
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,140
Yes.

878
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,540
You go to the side first.

879
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,520
You go to the side first.

880
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,780
Jinahi, there you are.

881
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,820
This is wrong.

882
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,580
Jinahi, although you've done Yokohama Riki,

883
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,460
the fear is covered in it in your eyes.

884
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
What is it like?

885
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,620
I...

886
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,940
What's the use of the bow?

887
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,860
It's empty, dull and dull.

888
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,340
There's no smell.

889
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,740
This is not the De Ling and Rong Ling.

890
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,220
At least, it's not what I want.

891
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:52,860
Come on.

892
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,020
You two try again.

893
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,580
Jian Xi, you go first.

894
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,220
I...

895
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:09,820
No.

896
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,180
I've told you many times.

897
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,500
I can't feel your happiness at all.

898
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,820
Rong Ling is not like that.

899
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,020
Forget it.

900
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,140
You stay here.

901
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,500
Ji Qing, you go first.

902
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,380
Your Highness.

903
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,380
Rong Ling is naive and romantic.

904
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,180
She's as beautiful as spring.

905
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,020
If she offended you,

906
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,420
please forgive her.

907
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,900
What did you call me?

908
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,220
Your Highness.

909
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,740
You must be confused by those shallow and light tools.

910
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,460
Your Highness is indeed a name.

911
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,020
But this is the teaching behind eunuchs and officials.

912
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,700
Behind?

913
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,460
Have you ever seen a student from the Imperial School

914
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,420
call Jiang Jie as an old man in person?

915
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,020
You two are not good at all.

916
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,980
This is not De Ling and Rong Ling at all.

917
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,500
You two are like a bunch of fools.

918
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,100
I'm really crazy.

919
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,780
I thought your eyes could overcome the difficulties.

920
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,380
You two go back.

921
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,940
Director.

922
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,100
I'll tell Qi Wen Sen to change you two.

923
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,380
Director.

924
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,780
Calm down.

925
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,700
If you need anything,

926
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,300
tell them they can do it.

927
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,780
I can't understand the role.

928
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
I can't act well.

929
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,580
I don't accept a professional actor.

930
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:28,980
Director.

931
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,900
Give us more time.

932
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,900
Let's think about the script.

933
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,020
Yes, director.

934
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,540
Give us another chance.

935
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,180
Three days.

936
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,060
I'll give you three days.

937
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,380
If you still can't catch the character in three days,

938
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,820
just give up.

939
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,380
Shen Yan.

940
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,660
Director.

941
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,180
Let's shoot your scene today.

942
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,780
I've already prepared it.

943
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,580
You two really let me down.

944
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,740
Qi Qing.

945
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,660
I think you're doing a great job.

946
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,020
You're acting well.

947
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,700
You're gentle, modest, noble and generous.

948
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,140
I wonder what kind of mother Li Dao has.

949
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,940
What does the real De Ling look like?

950
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,380
What else do you want?

951
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,940
To play De Ling,

952
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,780
you hired a teacher to learn etiquette.

953
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,260
You also learned French.

954
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,620
What else do you want?

955
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:22,900
Not enough.

956
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,180
That's not enough.

957
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,100
Qi Qing.

958
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,980
Red light.

959
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,820
What are you doing?

960
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,900
Qi Qing, what's wrong with you?

961
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,340
You seem to be living in another world.

962
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,900
There are so many cars on the road.

963
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,980
If one of them is not careful...

964
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,940
What did you say?

965
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,620
There are so many cars on the road.

966
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,740
If one of them is not careful...

967
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,260
Not that sentence.

968
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,500
I said...

969
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,300
I said you seem to be living in another world.

970
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,620
Yes.

971
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,940
Another world.

972
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,660
Qi Qing.

973
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,420
What's wrong with you?

974
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,820
De Ling knows the language of the five countries.

975
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,900
He can draw, plant flowers,

976
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,860
dance the Western dance, and take pictures.

977
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,940
He has a Western life experience.

978
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,100
But he is quiet and gentle.

979
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,500
So he is different from Rong Lin who is carefree.

980
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,780
It's hard for him to understand his inner heart.

981
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,980
If you want to understand this person,

982
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,180
you have to understand his inner world first.

983
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,140
In his own world,

984
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,940
he is silently in love with Guang Xu.

985
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,380
But in real life,

986
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,620
he has buried his love.

987
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,580
He never showed it to anyone.

988
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,620
Right?

989
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,220
Yes. Yes.

990
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,820
I understand. Let's go.

991
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,940
Rong Lin.

992
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,220
Jian Xi.

993
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,820
Jian Xi, come out for dinner.

994
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,540
Jian Xi.

995
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,460
It's really Rong Lin.

996
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,060
What's wrong?

997
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,860
Shouldn't he be practicing?

998
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,940
When he first got the script,

999
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,940
he learned Japanese and French,

1000
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,660
practiced etiquette every day,

1001
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,500
and danced in Western clothes.

1002
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
But now,

1003
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,740
he has let it all go.

1004
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,940
Let it all go?

1005
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,860
These three days,

1006
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,860
he played the zither and planted flowers.

1007
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,660
Even the script is not good enough.

1008
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
He has to practice.

1009
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,260
He has to practice.

1010
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,540
He has to practice.

1011
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,940
He has to practice.

1012
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,140
He has to practice.

1013
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,460
He has to practice.

1014
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,900
He even stopped reading the script.

1015
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,900
But Li Hong is going to face him tomorrow.

1016
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,380
What does he think?

1017
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,820
Will he give up completely?

1018
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,420
You go with him.

1019
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,140
I'm leaving.

1020
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,100
Bye, boss.

1021
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,340
Love is blind.

1022
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,380
Jian Xi.

1023
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,760
As a result of their other commonción,

1024
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,480
這個是運 身 生 的 了!

1025
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,220
Disneyland Beautiful Lesbians

1026
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,240
Vijayities of innocent and everything else

1027
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,840
I can make you happy

1028
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Okay.

1029
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,460
Ji Qing! Ji Qing!

1030
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,220
Why are you still drawing? We're leaving soon.

1031
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,340
Ji Qing!

1032
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,260
De Ling.

1033
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
De Ling.

1034
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,020
People in the palace won't call her De Ling.

1035
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,700
What is it then?

1036
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Third Miss.

1037
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,420
Because she ranks third,

1038
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,220
that's why they call her Third Miss.

1039
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,420
Third Miss?

1040
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,940
Director, have some tea.

1041
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,220
Okay, thank you. Leave it there.

1042
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,460
Director, we're here.

1043
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,860
Then let's start the performance.

1044
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,460
Let me see your results.

1045
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,460
What is she doing? Isn't it a performance?

1046
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,460
Quiet.

1047
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,460
The more I think of you, the more I feel lost

1048
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,460
I'm too crazy to think about anything

1049
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:13,460
Where should I put the red heart?

1050
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:19,460
Just like this, I wait for someone until dawn

1051
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:25,460
Just like this, I wait for someone until dawn

1052
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:32,460
Just like this, I wait for someone until dawn
