1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,480
Go down your own path

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't want

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,280
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is willing to give you strength

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, the standard age

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,240
Transformed into magical eyes

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,880
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
Put on the most solid gold armor

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
Hold the weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,800
Use all your strength to fight for the most real you

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,440
No matter what the little trick is

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,160
No matter what rumors are

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,840
I will definitely do it

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,080
World is invincible

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,400
I don't want you to be willing

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,880
Where is the gold

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,680
In front of the falling tree

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,400
The sweet

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,720
Where is your heart

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,000
My heart is here

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
Even if the world is invincible

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,880
It's just you

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Episode 2

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,240
Let me see

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,280
Look

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,120
I have drawn the lines in the script for you

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,880
I have been reading it recently

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,320
I will help you memorize some characters' psychology later

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
It will be easier to understand

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,320
So you have all been connected

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
Then why are you asking me?

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,720
Zuo Zuo

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,640
Brother Mu is so good to you

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,280
Don't always be angry with him

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,440
He is willing to

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,680
If he is not willing, he can leave

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Zuo Zuo

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,880
Aunt

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,560
It's okay

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,560
You guys talk first

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm going to work

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,760
Zuo Zuo

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
Did you go too far just now?

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm telling the truth

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Brother Mu is so good to you

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,440
How can you treat him like this?

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,080
Don't think that I have a few good looks at you

54
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,680
You can just criticize me

55
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,200
Aunt

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,680
If I didn't do this for your good

57
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,880
I wouldn't say these things

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,600
He doesn't deserve me at all

59
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
There is no such thing as love

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,920
It doesn't matter if he deserves it or not

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Moreover

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,480
Brother Mu is now a gold-ranked screenwriter

63
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,280
And he looks so elegant

64
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,880
How many girls like him?

65
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
How does he not deserve you?

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,920
But don't forget

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
He is my dad's adopted son

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,720
If it wasn't for our Zuo family

69
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,240
How could he have today?

70
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,200
In my eyes

71
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,040
He is always a

72
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,440
homeless wanderer

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,960
Zuo Zuo

74
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,480
Times are different now

75
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,960
I like

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,480
A man with personality

77
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,520
I don't like this kind of

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,640
A man who is weak

79
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
What I hate the most is

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,320
He always follows me

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,320
Can't even dare to go

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Like a dog

83
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,360
So I tell you

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,640
I will never fall in love with him

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,560
Let him give up on this

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,320
Brother Mu

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,080
My phone is here

88
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,840
You have completely hurt his heart this time

89
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,560
I just want him to know

90
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,800
Don't dream in the daytime

91
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,640
Face reality earlier

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,720
Aren't you afraid that he

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,080
Really no longer cares about you?

94
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm not afraid

95
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,840
Even if the sky falls down

96
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,760
He will not ignore me

97
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Ok

98
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,680
Brother Mu

99
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,960
Brother Mu

100
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,280
I'm calling you

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,000
What's up?

102
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,400
That script

103
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,920
I still have some places

104
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,880
Don't understand

105
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,360
Say it

106
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,040
Isn't Ximen a psychopath?

107
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,800
His character is hard to grasp

108
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
Ximen has been with his sister since childhood

109
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
Depend on each other

110
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,760
Until one day his sister

111
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,080
Being invaded by a group of

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,160
Social bandits

113
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,640
So he gave up

114
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,920
Original peaceful life

115
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,320
Set up the sky and the earth

116
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,760
Until I found this group

117
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,360
The killers who forced his sister to commit suicide

118
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,840
Kill them one by one

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,080
This terrible original motivation

120
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,520
Not because of hatred for the enemy

121
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,800
But for sister's love

122
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,080
So you also think this movie

123
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,320
Very good, right?

124
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,000
The audience is tired of your love story

125
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,560
So this kind of

126
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,200
Pleasant revenge

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Should be more visible

128
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,840
Do you have anything else?

129
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,520
I just want to say

130
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,240
I

131
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,240
What I just said

132
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,280
Not on purpose

133
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,280
It's ok

134
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm used to it

135
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,640
What do you mean it's ok?

136
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,840
Are you angry?

137
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,560
No

138
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,840
You are angry

139
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,640
Then you say you are angry

140
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,000
Why do you look like

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:36,360
It's like a

142
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,320
You hit me once, you scold me once

143
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,960
All can

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,360
I don't like you like this

145
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
Sorry i'm tired

146
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
Ok, ok

147
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,680
I go

148
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,640
Obviously you are bothering me

149
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,640
Why do you make it like me

150
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,560
I'm so sad that I chase you

151
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,160
Ok

152
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
You ignore me, right?

153
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,040
I don't care about you either

154
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,120
If you have the ability

155
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,960
You will never care about me in the future

156
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,680
Come

157
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,240
Thanks

158
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,400
Give you water, I don't drink it

159
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,280
Give you water, take it

160
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,960
Jianxi, still?

161
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
Since you are here, just try it

162
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,440
So many people still

163
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,560
rest assured

164
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
Come on. Don't be nervous.

165
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,360
Number 1, please come in.

166
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Yes.

167
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,760
Just take a look.

168
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,960
You have to have confidence.

169
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,360
Number 1, Yueyue.

170
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,360
Let's start.

171
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Chang Fei, go to hell!

172
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,960
As long as you're dead,

173
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,360
our family will be free.

174
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,160
It's all your fault.

175
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Chang Fei, go to hell!

176
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,760
Don't drag us into this anymore.

177
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Sister.

178
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,760
Please go.

180
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Because only if you die,

181
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,560
our family will be at peace.

182
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,360
I'm so painful.

183
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,160
Next, Jianxi.

184
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
Coming.

185
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,560
Don't be nervous. Relax.

186
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,160
You have the best condition.

187
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,760
Go.

188
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,960
Who is she?

189
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,960
Please.

190
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,960
Number 19, Jianxi.

191
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Jianxi's behavior is too cruel.

192
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,560
I'm really scared.

193
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,960
I don't want to be in the same movie with her anymore.

194
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,560
But I've promised Anxin

195
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,960
to give her a chance.

196
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Since you've promised,

197
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,160
I'll be patient.

198
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Forget it.

199
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,360
When I'm out of my mind,

200
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,560
I'll find a way to push her away.

201
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,960
This may be the last chance.

202
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,760
Jianxi, you must succeed.

203
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,560
Let's start.

204
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,360
Let's start.

205
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,160
Xiao Xiao,

206
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,760
really?

207
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:16,160
If it's what you want me to do,

208
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,760
I don't want you to consume it.

209
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
This isn't money.

210
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,760
I don't have money on me.

211
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,160
Why aren't you intimidating her?

212
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Why should I go to work and take care of my family?

213
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
I also want to have my own life.

214
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
But everything

215
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,160
was ruined by you.

216
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
What is he doing?

217
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Medication.

218
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Medication?

219
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Yes.

220
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,160
But isn't this attitude too quiet?

221
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
I don't dare to believe it.

222
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Compared to the explosion of the evil spirit,

223
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
I don't have my own dream.

224
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
this kind of calm performance

225
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
feels even more scary.

226
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I don't want to live like this forever.

227
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
What is this?

228
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Under the calm lake,

229
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
there is a hidden whirlpool.

230
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,160
This is the charm of performance.

231
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Chang Fei,

232
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
only when you die

233
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
can the whole family be at peace.

234
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Only when you die

235
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
can I not have to suffer so much.

236
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
I don't have to suffer like this anymore.

237
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Not pitiful.

238
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
You are not pitiful at all.

239
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Not pitiful at all.

240
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
I am so tired.

241
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
I am so tired.

242
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
I am really so tired.

243
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
I am really so tired.

244
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
I didn't mean to do it.

245
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
I don't want to kill you.

246
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
This is...

247
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
What is he doing?

248
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Isn't he going to kill Chang Fei?

249
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Why are you crying?

250
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Basically,

251
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
does your mother have such a description?

252
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
No.

253
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
No.

254
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
I really didn't mean to do it.

255
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Cut.

256
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Thank you, everyone.

257
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Why did you act like this?

258
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Because I think

259
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Chang Ran

260
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
is not that kind of

261
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
evil and scary woman.

262
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
You only got a part of the script.

263
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Why do you think so?

264
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
What I saw was Chang Ran

265
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
studying hard,

266
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
living hard,

267
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
and taking care of his parents.

268
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
But no matter how hard he tried,

269
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
everyone only had sick Chang Fei in their hearts.

270
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
So he always thought

271
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
his misfortune

272
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
was because of his sister.

273
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
So he hates Chang Fei

274
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
and hopes that he will disappear.

275
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
This is the evil of humanity.

276
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
But at the same time,

277
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
I saw

278
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
that Chang Ran also loved his sister.

279
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
He even loved her more than anyone else.

280
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Otherwise,

281
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
he wouldn't have taken so much time

282
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
and care so much

283
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
to take care of his sister.

284
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
You are not afraid

285
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
of taking the medicine,

286
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
but because you love her.

287
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
That's why you are crying.

288
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
I think so.

289
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Chang Ran has been taking care of his sister.

290
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
When time passes,

291
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
he will get tired

292
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
and tired.

293
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
This is the love of humanity.

294
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
But a real family

295
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
will not abandon each other

296
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
no matter what.

297
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
This is an indescribable loss.

298
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
You understand very well.

299
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Thank you, producer Liu.

300
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
I thought

301
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I would never

302
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
stand here

303
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
and perform again.

304
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
I admire your acting.

305
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
I'll leave this role to you.

306
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Thank you.

307
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
But

308
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
I want to try

309
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
another role.

310
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Another role?

311
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
I want to try Chang Fei again.

312
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Are you thinking about the future?

313
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Chang Fei has already decided the candidate.

314
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
I believe I can act better than him.

315
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm sorry. Please leave.

316
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Producer Liu,

317
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
I can act as a role.

318
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
I can act as a role.

319
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Producer Liu,

320
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I can act as the real Chang Fei.

321
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Please give me a chance.

322
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Please leave.

323
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
The 20th is coming soon.

324
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Who is the best candidate?

325
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Don't you want to see it yourself?

326
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
She is so bold.

327
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Yes.

328
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
She dares to come to the world to be the heroine.

329
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
I've never seen such a fairy.

330
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Naive.

331
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Miss Jin.

332
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
To play Chang Fei,

333
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
I tied a bandage on my body every day.

334
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
I even felt like I was in the cold.

335
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I know what she is thinking.

336
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
What are you thinking?

337
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Producer Liu, I'm begging you.

338
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Please give me a chance.

339
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
I don't care if it's a chance to lose my memory.

340
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Let me go.

341
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Don't do this.

342
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Let me go.

343
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Wait.

344
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Why hasn't she come out yet?

345
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Next.

346
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
No. 20, Huang Bingbing.

347
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Come on.

348
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Come on.

349
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Come on.

350
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
How is it?

351
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Say something.

352
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm so nervous now.

353
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Hurry up.

354
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
What's the result?

355
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Thank you all for coming to the world to be the actress.

356
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
I see you all worked hard.

357
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Look, the movie is here.

358
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
After the screening of me and many judges,

359
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
What happened?

360
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Now the list of actors in the movie has been set.

361
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Next, I officially announce

362
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
the main cast list of my soul 21 classes.

363
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
The first female lead,

364
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Chang Fei,

365
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
will be the audition.

366
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
The list of main actors has been announced.

367
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Today's press conference ends here.

368
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Thank you all for coming.

369
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
What are you looking at?

370
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Next, the reporters can...

371
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Liu Neng.

372
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Liu Neng.

373
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Liu Zhitian, please accept our interview.

374
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Sure.

375
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Please ask.

376
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
How could it be the audition?

377
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Why is it the audition?

378
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
It's not compatible with the previous news.

379
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Yes.

380
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
It was decided temporarily.

381
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Didn't you say that the audition was already set?

382
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
What's going on?

383
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Yes.

384
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Why did you let the audition replace Shen Yan?

385
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
For the producer,

386
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Can the most famous actor be selected?

387
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
But I'm not just a producer.

388
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I'm more passionate about creating beauty.

389
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,160
What I want is not the most famous actor at the moment,

390
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
but the most suitable one.

391
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
When the audition appeared,

392
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
his performance

393
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
brought Chang Fei back to life.

394
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,160
This is the reason why I changed my mind.

395
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Miss Neng, please make a comment.

396
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Be quiet.

397
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
This kind of thing

398
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
often happens.

399
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Impossible.

400
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
It's impossible.

401
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Calm down.

402
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I've done a lot of homework.

403
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
I've done a lot of experiments.

404
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Let's go.

405
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I also experienced the feeling of being frozen.

406
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
So I understand Chang Fei's heart.

407
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
I also hope that more people can understand

408
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
people like Chang Fei to help them.

409
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
By the way, Yu.

410
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Help me find a house.

411
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
The closer to my house, the better.

412
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
What are you going to do? Change the house?

413
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Don't ask so much.

414
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
It's best to move into my house.

415
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Okay, no problem.

416
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
The information on this living room

417
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
is still quite large.

418
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
I'll find it.

419
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Your house downstairs

420
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
is also on sale.

421
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Please help me get it done.

422
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Hello.

423
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I saw your house on Anju Ke

424
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
was on sale.

425
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Have you sold it yet?

426
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Jian Xi is really too much.

427
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
He actually took away

428
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
your role halfway.

429
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
What should I do now?

430
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
I just called Liu Zhi Pian.

431
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
He said he would not change his mind

432
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,160
no matter what.

433
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
No.

434
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
He will definitely change his mind.

435
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Help me with something tomorrow.

436
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Coming.

437
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Coming.

438
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Who is it?

439
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
It's you.

440
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Why did you knock on the door?

441
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Come with me.

442
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Where to?

443
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Don't ask so much.

444
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Come with me.

445
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
I'll go with you.

446
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
I'll go with you.

447
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
I'll go with you.

448
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
I'll go with you.

449
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
I'll go with you.

450
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
You are too much.

451
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Come with me.

452
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
If you don't make it clear,

453
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
I won't go with you.

454
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Are you afraid I'll sell you out?

455
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Maybe.

456
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
What are you doing?

457
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Give me back my bag.

458
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
You crazy.

459
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Give me back my bag.

460
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Hey.

461
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Hey.

462
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Hey.

463
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
My bag.

464
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Hey.

465
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Hey.

466
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Come in.

467
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Where is this?

468
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
From today on,

469
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
you will live here.

470
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
What?

471
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Can't you hear me?

472
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
I said from today on,

473
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
you will live here with me.

474
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Why?

475
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
How long are you going to live in the garage?

476
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
You dare to leave after being exposed by the reporters?

477
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I know I've been living there.

478
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Anxin is already helping me move.

479
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
So you said

480
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
it's not better for you to move here.

481
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
But this is not my house.

482
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
You can live wherever I ask you to.

483
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

484
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
What do you mean?

485
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Don't put it in my bag.

486
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
It's just on the paper.

487
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Listen to me.

488
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
I ask you.

489
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Who helped me clean up after you moved away?

490
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
You stay here.

491
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
At least help me clean up.

492
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
It's convenient for you.

493
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I didn't understand before.

494
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Now I understand.

495
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
I want to maintain my image.

496
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,160
If others see me living with you in a building,

497
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
what will others think?

498
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
What do you think this is?

499
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Can the reporters just go in and out?

500
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Tang Fei, but this is not my house.

501
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Enough.

502
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I won't let you live for nothing.

503
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
I will take your rent every month.

504
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Okay?

505
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
But...

506
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

507
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
This gift is for you.

508
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
For me?

509
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
It's so nice suddenly.

510
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Wait.

511
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Open it after I leave.

512
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Secret.

513
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Tang Fei.

514
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
How can you give me such a gift?

515
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Look at her.

516
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
She looks like you.

517
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Stop.

518
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
You're a bad guy.

519
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Jian Xi.

520
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Really?

521
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Jian Xi.

522
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Shen Yan.

523
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
You're so popular now.

524
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
You should be very busy.

525
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Why are you here?

526
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
You know everything.

527
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
It's all because of you.

528
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
You took my role.

529
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Now Liu Tao won't let me play the leading role.

530
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Everything was going well.

531
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
After I play the leading role,

532
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
my career will go up a level.

533
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
For this day,

534
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
I've been practicing every day.

535
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
I've been working hard.

536
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Yes.

537
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
You're practicing.

538
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
In addition to practicing,

539
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
in order to let everyone know

540
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
that you played a top movie,

541
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
you also released the news to the media.

542
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
You know I'm going to play Chang Fei.

543
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
So you're so jealous.

544
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
You took the role with a despicable means,

545
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
right?

546
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Despicable means?

547
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Do you think I'm like you?

548
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
I won't do those things like you.

549
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
I'm a decent person.

550
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
I get what I deserve.

551
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
We're all the same.

552
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Don't be so arrogant.

553
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Who's the same as you?

554
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
Can you stop being so arrogant?

555
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Jian Xi wants to win.

556
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
That's also about his strength.

557
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
He's deliberately weak in front of me.

558
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
He's weak.

559
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
And he's playing tricks behind my back.

560
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,160
You're not human at all.

561
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Can you talk to me nicely?

562
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
If you keep talking like this,

563
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
I'll call the security.

564
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Do you know how much effort I've put in

565
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
to make Liu Tao learn martial arts to be the leading actress?

566
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Now it's all gone.

567
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
You've ruined it.

568
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Give me back the mirror.

569
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Let go.

570
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
It's okay.

571
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
It's okay.

572
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Let me see.

573
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Shen Yan.

574
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
How are you?

575
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Jian Xi.

576
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
How can you hurt people on purpose?

577
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Jian Xi.

578
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160
I was the one who introduced you to the mirror.

579
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
I didn't expect you to be behind the scenes.

580
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
But now

581
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
I've given you the role.

582
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Why are you still treating me like this?

583
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Jian Xi used despicable means to take the role.

584
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
Now he's hurting people.

585
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
How can a person like him

586
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
deserve to continue being an actress?

587
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
You're going to be a star.

588
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
You're going to be an actress.

589
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
You're going to be a star.

590
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
I'll give you everything.

591
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
I'll give you everything.

592
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
But why are you still hurting people?

593
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
I treat you as my best friend.

594
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Why are you treating me like this?

595
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Is it fun to be like this?

596
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Stop shooting.

597
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Stop shooting.

598
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
It's all my fault.

599
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
It's all my fault.

600
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
It's all my fault.

601
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
I shouldn't have fought with him for the role.

602
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Jian Xi finally got the role.

603
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Don't write nonsense.

604
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
I beg you not to write nonsense.

605
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Who knows what despicable means he used

606
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
to take the role?

607
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Have you forgotten

608
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
the thing between him and Yuan Liang last time?

609
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
If the negative news is exposed now,

610
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
am I going to lose

611
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
the female lead I just got?

612
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,160
He deliberately angered me

613
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
and forced me to do it.

614
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
He made a fake smile that was bullied.

615
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
He pretended to be poor in front of the public.

616
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,160
He used tears every time to make sympathy.

617
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,160
But it's not every time that he can succeed.

618
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
What a coincidence.

619
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Today, I asked Liu Zhi Pian to come and talk about the role.

620
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
He happened to catch up with a good play.

621
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
The performance is really wonderful.

622
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Liu Zhi Pian, you have to believe me.

623
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
You have to believe me.

624
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
It's him. He's lying.

625
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
This is all his game.

626
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
Liu Zhi Pian,

627
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
you just saw a wonderful performance.

628
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
What do you think of Miss Shen Yan's acting?

629
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
She's too cunning.

630
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
I suggest we change the role.

631
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Let me explain it to everyone.

632
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Miss Shen Yan wants to take the opportunity to take the role

633
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
and pretend to be poor again.

634
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Unexpectedly, she was caught.

635
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Shen Yan, stop shooting.

636
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Shen Yan.

637
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Thank you, Liu Zhi Pian.

638
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
I didn't expect her to be like this.

639
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
But fortunately, she was at ease.

640
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Thanks to the press conference,

641
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
she was able to get the news.

642
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
That's why she didn't succeed.

643
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Of course.

644
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
I'm a professional agent.

645
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
But we have to be careful.

646
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Because I don't think she'll give up easily.

647
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Move aside. Stop shooting.

648
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Stop shooting. Stop shooting.

649
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Shen Yan is not going to be interviewed now.

650
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Move aside. Stop shooting. Stop shooting.

651
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Why are the reporters here today?

652
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,160
Today, I was supposed to go to the public theater to see the play.

653
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Who knew that she called a group of reporters to humiliate me.

654
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
That's not possible.

655
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Jin Xi is not that kind of person.

656
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
She has misunderstood me too deeply.

657
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
She thought I was the one who did it.

658
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
No matter what I do,

659
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
I can't change her opinion of me.

660
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Actually, I made up for her.

661
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Make up for her?

662
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Otherwise,

663
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,160
how could she get the role of the leading actress in the movie?

664
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Oh.

665
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
I gave her the role.

666
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
She said I was a fake star.

667
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Is there any misunderstanding between you two?

668
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,160
I really don't understand why she hates me so much.

669
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
I lost my best friend.

670
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Do you think the reporters will dislike me?

671
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Don't worry.

672
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Everything will pass.

673
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Ke Lu.

674
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Ke Lu.

675
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Can you stay with me?

676
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
I'm really scared.

677
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
I'm scared.

678
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
I'll send you back first.

679
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Man Xin.

680
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Someone sent it this morning.

681
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Really?

682
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Please cheer up.

683
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
I'm waiting to watch the new movie.

684
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Mr. T.

685
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Get ready.

686
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
We're about to start shooting.

687
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
For this friend who has always supported me,

688
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I should work hard too.

689
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
Action.

690
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
What?

691
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
You don't even know how to drink porridge.

692
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
And you want me to feed you?

693
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Sister.

694
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I don't want you to give up your job at the hospital.

695
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
I have to quit my job.

696
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
You don't belong to me alone.

697
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,160
I don't want you to give up your dream of being a doctor because of me.

698
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
I can do anything.

699
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I can live my own life.

700
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
It's all your fault.

701
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
The more you work hard,

702
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
the more painful I feel.

703
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
I want to leave this family.

704
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
I don't want to see you again.

705
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Sister.

706
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Sister.

707
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Let go of me.

708
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Sister.

709
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Sister, you can't go.

710
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Don't abandon us.

711
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
It's all my fault.

712
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,160
As long as you don't go, I can do anything.

713
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
I can do anything.

714
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
I can live my own life.

715
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Even if I leave this family.

716
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Yes.

717
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
You deserve to die.

718
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
If you die,

719
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I'll be the one who will die.

720
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
If you die,

721
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
the whole family will be free.

722
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
I'm going crazy.

723
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
I'm sorry.

724
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
I'm sorry.

725
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I don't know how to answer you.

726
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
It's all my fault.

727
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
As long as I don't go, I can do anything.

728
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,160
As long as I don't go, I can do anything.

729
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Cut.

730
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Cut.

731
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Okay.

732
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Next scene.

733
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Yanxi.

734
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Director.

735
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Why do you want to make such a movie?

736
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
It's so sad.

737
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
I make this movie.

738
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
To give people hope.

739
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
For the patient,

740
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
the disease is getting worse.

741
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
But even if you can't smile,

742
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
you have to stick to the last moment.

743
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
This is what I want everyone to see.

744
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Even if you work hard,

745
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
it's meaningless.

746
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Break through the obstacles of the disease.

747
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Rebuild the lost relatives.

748
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Spend time and again

749
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
to support the life of the poor.

750
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,160
This is an encouragement for everyone.

751
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,160
But I still don't understand.

752
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
People who see this movie in the future

753
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
will think for themselves.

754
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Children who are sick like that

755
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
can live with full strength.

756
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
I want to cherish life more.

757
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Love my family.

758
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
As long as everyone has this idea,

759
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
the movie will be successful.

760
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
I just want everyone to know

761
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
that life itself

762
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
is a kind of happiness.

763
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Then why did you give up Shen Yan

764
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
and choose Jian Xin?

765
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Action.

766
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Sister.

767
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
A doctor in the United States said

768
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
that after a person dies,

769
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
his weight will be reduced by 21 grams.

770
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
That's the weight of the soul.

771
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Do you believe it?

772
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Don't think about the day.

773
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
What should be lost is water.

774
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
How can it be the weight of the soul?

775
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
I thought

776
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
people really have souls.

777
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
It's a man's dream.

778
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
The weather is good today.

779
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
I'm going out for a walk.

780
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
Don't tell your parents.

781
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
Listen.

782
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,720
I'd like to be with you now.

783
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
I will have the time I want.

784
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
I as well.

785
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
When she looks on my face

786
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
I'll be happy.

787
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Just as Dad didn't get two eggs,

788
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
It's Chang Fei.

789
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,760
The way he did his leg just now

790
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,160
looked totally stiff.

791
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,760
Don't look at this small detail.

792
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,160
It directly relates to the success of the performance.

793
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,360
This shows that he put his heart

794
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
into the performance.

795
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,360
I'm willing to give the chance

796
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,560
to such a hard actor.

797
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,360
I'll pour it for you later when you want to drink.

798
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,360
Jianxi.

799
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,560
Ji Qin.

800
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,360
You were really great today.

801
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,760
Thank you.

802
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,160
If it weren't for the fact that Liu Zhiping

803
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
was willing to give you the chance,

804
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,360
you would still be running around.

805
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,560
The chance is only for those who are prepared.

806
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:27,960
Jianxi.

807
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
I will definitely wait for you

808
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
at this year's Film Festival.

809
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm looking forward to

810
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
having a good match with you.

811
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
He just said

812
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,160
this year's Phoenix Film Festival.

813
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,560
Do your best.

814
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,560
I...

815
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,360
Ji Qin.

816
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,760
What's wrong with you?

817
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,960
You haven't spoken since just now.

818
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
He's coming after me.

819
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,560
Just when I thought

820
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,960
I was winning,

821
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,960
he was about to come after me.

822
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,160
I think he's quite ordinary.

823
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,760
You're thinking too much.

824
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
Didn't you see?

825
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
His tears,

826
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,960
his despair,

827
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,160
are all real Chang Fei.

828
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:12,960
But

829
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,760
I will not lose to him.

830
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,160
I will never lose to him.

831
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,760
I will never lose to him.

832
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,160
Xiao Xiao.

833
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,160
Xiao Xiao.

834
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
What's wrong with Ji Qin?

835
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,960
To play the role of Fat Girl,

836
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,360
he's been respecting her every day.

837
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,960
Eat, sleep, sleep, eat.

838
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
It's too scary.

839
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,960
But...

840
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Isn't there a special effect?

841
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:47,960
I told you.

842
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,360
If you're a little fatter,

843
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,760
you'll look more real.

844
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,560
Then you're eating so much.

845
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,360
Is there any problem?

846
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,360
Ji Qin.

847
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,560
Ji Qin, what's wrong?

848
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,760
You really can't eat anymore.

849
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:00,960
I'm fine.

850
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,560
Ji Qin.

851
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,760
I'm fine.

852
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,160
I'll go to the hospital with you, okay?

853
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
It's not over yet.

854
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,560
How can I leave the scene?

855
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,960
But you've already vomited.

856
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,560
You're already like this.

857
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Okay, okay, stop talking.

858
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,560
Xiao Xiao, go tell the director

859
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,960
that the previous scene was not good.

860
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,960
I want to do it again.

861
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,960
The previous scene has been shot so many times.

862
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,960
The director said it was okay.

863
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
But the scene is not good enough.

864
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
The meeting is not in place.

865
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,760
Stop talking.

866
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Do as I said.

867
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,360
Go.

868
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,560
Boss.

869
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,560
Yes.

870
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,360
What's going on?

871
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,760
Ji Qin is not satisfied with a scene.

872
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,360
He shot it many times.

873
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,560
He's not feeling well.

874
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,960
But he just doesn't want to rest.

875
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
He insists on holding on.

876
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,560
What are these?

877
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Ji Qin worked hard to make this role more important.

878
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,160
But the pressure is too great.

879
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,360
The fatter you want to be, the fatter you can't be.

880
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,960
He vomited in the morning.

881
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,360
But he just doesn't want to rest.

882
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,360
Boss, if this goes on, he will fall ill.

883
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,360
What should we do?

884
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,760
It's not that I haven't played this kind of role before.

885
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,960
There are many ways to hide it.

886
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
This time is different.

887
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Tell me honestly.

888
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,360
Why is he so hardworking?

889
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,760
I think he doesn't want to be surpassed by anyone.

890
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Who is he afraid of?

891
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,760
Jiang Xin.

892
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,760
Since Jiang Xin left Changfei,

893
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,760
Ji Qin has been working hard like crazy.

894
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
Someone should persuade him.

895
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,160
So I asked you to come.

896
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,560
He won't listen to me.

897
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,160
What should we do?

898
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,360
In the Phoenix Film Festival,

899
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,960
I will make him win.

900
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,160
What you said has nothing to do with me.

901
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,360
Please don't bother me again.

902
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,160
What's wrong?

903
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,160
Nothing.

904
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,360
Come.

905
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,160
Director, is the scene ready?

906
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,160
Can we start shooting?

907
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,360
Director Han.

908
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Dad, are you feeling better?

909
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,560
There are too many things going on in the company.

910
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
I'm too busy to have any time to spare.

911
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,960
So I didn't come to see you.

912
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,960
I'm sorry.

913
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,960
What's going on in the company?

914
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,160
Yang Mingyi's contract expired.

915
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
The public entertainment company is on a high price.

916
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,160
They want to get him.

917
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,560
He obviously wants to make a big deal.

918
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,760
But don't worry.

919
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,960
I will definitely settle this.

920
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,760
There's nothing to be afraid of.

921
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,360
That guy

922
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,160
always makes some

923
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,360
nonsense rumors.

924
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
If I hadn't helped him,

925
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,560
he would have been dead by now.

926
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,360
So you can tell him

927
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
that he can cancel the contract.

928
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,560
But if he can't,

929
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
his future

930
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,360
will be up to him.

931
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Dad, don't worry.

932
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,560
I will definitely settle this.

933
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,560
Where's Brother Li?

934
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,560
I've told you many times.

935
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
I have to see him.

936
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,960
Dad,

937
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
you know that

938
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,360
he has a deep misunderstanding about us.

939
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
You're a piece of crap.

940
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,760
Give me the phone.

941
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,360
Dad.

942
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,960
Give me the phone. I'll call him myself.

943
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,560
No.

944
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
What do you want?

945
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,560
If you hang up on me,

946
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,760
I'll go to the box office to get you.

947
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,160
I've told you many times.

948
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,160
As long as you can come, I can give you the shares and money of Hanyu Company.

949
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,080
I have made many mistakes before.

950
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,160
But we are father and son.

951
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,600
You can't hate your father forever.

952
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,560
I really want to see you now.

953
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,280
Can't you come over to see me?

954
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,400
It's almost done. You can start shooting.

955
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,920
Thank you.

956
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,840
Hello? Hello?

957
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,880
Pang Fei, have you ever heard me?

958
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,160
Pang Fei, have you heard me?

959
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,000
Pang Fei, Pang Fei.

960
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,480
What's wrong with you?

961
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,160
Pang Fei, Pang Fei.

962
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,760
Hello? Have you ever heard me?

963
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,800
Pang Fei.

964
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,320
Hello?

965
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,360
Hello? Who are you?

966
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,080
You're so bad.

967
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,680
I'm here.

968
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,680
Come on. Three, two, one. Action.

969
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,600
Dad.

970
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,480
Hurry up and think of a way. I have to see him.

971
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,560
Dad, give me some more time.

972
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,760
What time do I give you?

973
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,360
You're all young and can wait.

974
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,080
But what about me? Can't I get out of bed when I'm in a panic?

975
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,360
I have to think of a way to get out of the hospital.

976
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,760
Dad, you're so weak. How can you get out of the hospital?

977
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,360
Then you know that's my lifelong wish.

978
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,120
I have to fulfill it.

979
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,360
Go. Hurry up and get me out of the hospital.

980
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,920
Dad.

981
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,520
Hurry up.

982
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,000
I heard that you're brave enough to do anything as long as you have money.

983
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,600
That's right. I'm not brave enough to kill people and set them on fire.

984
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,080
I just want you to teach me how to be a girl.

985
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:44,320
You just need to use a knife to cut through her face.

986
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,600
Even if you get caught,

987
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,400
you'll be the one who will be the one to be punished.

988
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,200
No problem. Wait for my news.

989
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,640
Go.

990
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,120
I'll give you any amount you offer as long as you can come here.

991
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,760
I did do a lot of bad things,

992
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
but we are blood.

993
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,160
You can't hate your father forever.

994
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,160
Your highness.

995
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,840
Tomorrow morning, we're going to take a photo.

996
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,560
Then we'll go to the company's board meeting at 10 o'clock.

997
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,120
And then we have to go to the city's outdoor photo shoot at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

998
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,920
You Le, I'm so bored.

999
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,640
Let's go out and take a walk.

1000
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,960
Don't worry.

1001
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,760
Have a good rest. I'm fine.

1002
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,680
Okay, bye.

1003
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,680
The only thing that Chang Fei likes is painting.

1004
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,640
In his 19 years of life,

1005
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,920
the only thing he has is painting.

1006
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,440
What are you doing?

1007
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,560
Miss, don't blame me.

1008
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,080
Someone is trying to ruin your face.

1009
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,560
Help!

1010
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,040
Someone!

1011
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,800
Why aren't you cooking? I'm hungry.

1012
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,600
Have you ever seen a man fight?

1013
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,400
Ni Chang, grant me a wish to concrete the brick crane.

1014
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,320
I love this.

1015
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,560
You made a lot of tar.

1016
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,060
A light

1017
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,060
With loneliness

1018
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,560
And my endless feelings

1019
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,760
Look at the prosperity and prosperity

1020
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,060
Look at loneliness and sadness

1021
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,460
Look at the tide and the people

1022
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,560
The cold and the dark

1023
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,060
There are too many expectations

1024
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,060
In the end, there is despair

1025
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,060
Look at you coming and going

1026
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,560
Hold on to the wind and frost

1027
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,560
All are wandering

1028
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:29,060
Still stubborn, but still young and crazy

1029
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:35,060
There is absurdity, don't forget the fire

1030
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,060
Looking back, there will be grudges

1031
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:47,060
You and I, we are getting lost on the road

1032
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,060
The typhoon is going, don't think about anything

1033
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,060
Where is the new red sea going?

1034
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:05,060
Just like this, wait for a person until dawn

1035
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:11,060
Just like this, wait for a person until dawn

1036
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:19,060
Just like this, wait for a person until dawn
