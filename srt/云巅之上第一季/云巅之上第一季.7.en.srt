1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,960
Look at me with strange eyes

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,840
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't want

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far away

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
In that moment, in the second year

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will be a magical eye

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,800
Pass through the loneliness to find you

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Hold the weapon in your hand

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,760
Use all your strength to fight for the most real you

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,360
No matter what the little tricks

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what rumors

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,960
I will definitely be invincible

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't care if you are willing

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Where is the gold?

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,320
In the past, I kept the sweet

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,600
No matter where your heart is

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
My heart is here

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
Even if the iron armor is invincible

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm only one you

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,920
The end

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Is it that easy?

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
What is the reason for you to work so hard?

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
To make everyone applaud you,

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
to cheer you up,

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
to be sure that you will act, right?

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Why did you win the award at the film festival?

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,320
It's also a kind of confirmation for the audience to give you a performance, right?

34
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Jianxi,

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
there's only one step left.

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
As long as you climb to the top,

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
you will become the most famous actress,

38
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
become the best actress,

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
and get the best opportunity.

40
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
You must win.

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
You must win.

42
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
You must let everyone know

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,320
that everything you've done is not easy.

44
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Do you understand?

45
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Recently,

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,580
the

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:41,320
The

48
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
It's Jianxi.

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
By the way,

50
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
where are we going to eat today?

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:03,320
The

52
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
Jianxi,

53
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
thank you for your hard work.

54
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Why are you being polite to me?

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm not tired at all.

56
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Hi.

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Hi.

58
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
You don't even say hello to me.

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
I don't know.

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
I'll go first.

61
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Why are you so cold to me?

62
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
It's okay.

63
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Let's go.

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Tang Fei,

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
you should say hello to me.

66
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
You don't have to be so rude.

67
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
I'm talking to you.

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
The further I am from her,

69
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
the better.

70
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Don't get involved in any relationship.

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
But she doesn't know your intentions.

72
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
She will misunderstand.

73
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
I don't care.

74
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
But...

75
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Get in the car.

76
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,320
The

77
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Jianxi,

78
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
thank you for your hard work.

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
I've been asking you to act with me.

80
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
It's not acting.

81
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,320
It may be a show for you.

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
But for me,

83
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
I'm very happy these days.

84
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Actually,

85
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
even if I don't stand out,

86
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
she won't let me go.

87
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Don't forget,

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,320
the first gift is for me.

89
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
So,

90
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
I'm not just helping you,

91
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
but also helping myself.

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Of course,

93
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,320
I still want to be selfish.

94
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
What selfishness?

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
I want to be with you.

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
No matter what way,

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
what reason,

98
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
I don't care.

99
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
And,

100
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
didn't you find out?

101
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
What?

102
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,320
I dumped all the people from Qi Wensen.

103
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,320
They are also to protect you.

104
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
They are really annoying.

105
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
They've been staring at me for 24 hours.

106
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Once,

107
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
they went to the bathroom.

108
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
But,

109
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
I think it's been peaceful recently.

110
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Nothing happened.

111
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Someone must be playing a prank on me.

112
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Answer the phone.

113
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Hello.

114
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Hello, Tang Fei.

115
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Did you see Jansi?

116
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
She's been missing for a whole day.

117
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Missing?

118
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Yes.

119
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
She didn't answer my call.

120
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
She left the studio.

121
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
I can't find her.

122
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Okay.

123
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
I'll call her.

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Hello.

125
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Please redial later.

127
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Qi Qing,

128
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
I have to go back now.

129
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
What's wrong?

130
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Sorry.

131
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
There's an accident.

132
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
What happened?

133
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Tell Xiaoxiao to pick you up.

134
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
You call her.

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
I really have to go.

136
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Tang Fei.

137
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Jansi.

138
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Jansi.

139
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Hello, Yue Le.

140
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Are you in the company?

141
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
Yes.

142
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Four, four, five, six, seven, eight,

143
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
four, five,

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
four,

145
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Jansi.

146
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Why didn't you tell me you were practicing dancing?

147
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
I'm practicing here.

148
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Nothing happened.

149
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
What's wrong?

150
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Do you know that Anxin said that you were missing?

151
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
How is that possible?

152
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
I told Anxin that I was practicing martial arts here.

153
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
It's really this guy who did it.

154
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
He did it on purpose, right?

155
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
What happened?

156
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Hello?

157
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Tang Fei, it seems like someone is following me.

158
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Come in.

159
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
What are you doing?

160
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Ji Qin!

161
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Let go of me!

162
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Let go of me!

163
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Ji Qin, marry me!

164
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Ji Qin!

165
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I love you!

166
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Marry me!

167
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Call the police!

168
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Marry me!

169
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Ji Qin!

170
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
What's going on?

171
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
It hurts.

172
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Don't look.

173
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I...

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Jianxi, why are you here?

176
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
This happened today.

177
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
You should tell me the reason.

178
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Just like what you saw,

179
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
she doesn't want to get you involved.

180
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
That's why she's keeping distance from you.

181
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
What's wrong?

182
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
She doesn't want to get me involved.

183
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
She doesn't trust me.

184
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Otherwise,

185
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
she wouldn't let Ji Qin help me.

186
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
No, don't misunderstand.

187
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Thank you for coming to see me today.

188
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
I'll go first.

189
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Jianxi.

190
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Mr. Yue,

191
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
don't worry, leave it to me.

192
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Let's go.

193
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Why did you do that?

194
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Why did you come back so early?

195
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
What's wrong?

196
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Why are you so angry?

197
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
You know I'm practicing at the company.

198
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Why did you lie to him?

199
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Why did you bring Tang Fei here?

200
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
I just want to see if he values you.

201
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Okay, you succeeded.

202
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Do you know that your boring experiment

203
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
has scared Ji Qin?

204
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Ji Qin?

205
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
What does it have to do with him?

206
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Please don't get angry.

207
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
What does it have to do with him?

208
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Please don't bother about Tang Fei and me anymore.

209
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Okay?

210
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
I'm just concerned about you.

211
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
You're absent-minded every day.

212
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
I called Tang Fei and asked him.

213
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Didn't you just get the test result?

214
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
He values you.

215
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I'll tell you clearly.

216
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Ji Qin is Tang Fei's girlfriend.

217
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
We're just friends.

218
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Please don't worry about it.

219
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Jianxi, what are you doing?

220
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
So fierce.

221
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Just friends?

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
Just friends?

223
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Just friends?

224
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
You're a ghost.

225
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Teacher.

226
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Let's go.

227
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Where?

228
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
I'll take you to a place.

229
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Aren't you going to teach me today?

230
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
What you need now is not a lesson,

231
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
but a heart.

232
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Teacher.

233
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
I've already told you.

234
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
I can work hard on acting.

235
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
But the award...

236
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Let's talk about it after you finish.

237
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
I...

238
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Aren't you leaving?

239
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Where is this?

240
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Today is the last show for each of us.

241
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Go and watch Zuo Zuo's performance.

242
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
It won't waste your time.

243
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Hurry up.

244
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Mr. Zhang.

245
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Mr. Zhang.

246
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Mr. Zhang.

247
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
What's wrong with you?

248
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Wake up, Mr. Zhang.

249
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Mr. Zhang.

250
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Xiwen, stop.

251
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I've already investigated it.

252
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
You changed the medicine

253
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
for Mr. Zhang's heart disease.

254
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
That's why he died of heart disease.

255
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
You're not deliberately killing people.

256
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
I really didn't expect

257
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
a pretty girl like you

258
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
to do such a vicious thing.

259
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Tell me.

260
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Why did you kill so many people?

261
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Because

262
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
they deserve to die.

263
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Do you know

264
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
how Mo Li died?

265
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
It was them.

266
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
They forced my sister to die.

267
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
They violated her.

268
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
And that damn Li Ping Sheng.

269
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
He used the name of Mo Li

270
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
to check her.

271
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
He humiliated her over and over again.

272
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
After humiliating her,

273
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
he even used the word

274
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
to say these words on the wine table.

275
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
He took them out over and over again.

276
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
So,

277
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
I cut his throat

278
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
with a knife.

279
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
My Mo Li,

280
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
she didn't want to go to school.

281
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
So I transferred her to a school.

282
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm the one who deserves to die.

283
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
She promised to protect my Mo Li

284
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
in front of me.

285
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
But she turned her back on me.

286
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
She turned her back on me over and over again

287
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
to tell everyone how she was violated.

288
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
And she.

289
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
She deserved to die.

290
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
She forced my Mo Li to die.

291
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
Do you know

292
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
those days

293
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
when I was Mo Li,

294
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
she would have nightmares every day.

295
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
When she had nightmares,

296
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
she would wake up and say,

297
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
sister,

298
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
I'm so scared.

299
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Can you save me?

300
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Save me, please!

301
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Then,

302
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
she ran from the upstairs

303
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
and fell down.

304
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
She fell down

305
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
and broke her bones.

306
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
She was clearly bullied.

307
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
But no one cared about her.

308
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
No one.

309
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Everyone was

310
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
laughing at her

311
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
and being shameless.

312
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Being shameless.

313
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
She was being humiliated.

314
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
She was humiliated.

315
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
They were the accomplices of the murder.

316
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Since this is a world

317
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
that can't be divided by right or wrong,

318
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
I will take them

319
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
to hell from heaven.

320
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Look. Good acting.

321
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Thank you, Brother Bei.

322
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Do you know Zuo Zuo?

323
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
You've seen it all.

324
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
When you were in a state of disquiet

325
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
and swayed,

326
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
your opponents were working hard.

327
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
The movie of Love Has Began

328
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
was the best.

329
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Including the former Xiu Hua pillow, Zuo Zuo,

330
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
now he has become your strong opponent.

331
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
You should think about what you should do.

332
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Come on, Jian Xi.

333
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
You must get the best female lead

334
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
in Phoenix Film Festival.

335
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Stand at the top.

336
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Come on, Jian Xi.

337
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
You must get the best female lead

338
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
in Phoenix Film Festival.

339
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Stand at the top.

340
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Here. Ten shots.

341
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Ready.

342
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Action.

343
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Sister.

344
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Why are we here?

345
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
You like painting.

346
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
But since you were sick,

347
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
you never came to the gallery.

348
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
You used to come here to visit.

349
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
That's...

350
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
This is the work

351
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
you got from the newspaper when you were six.

352
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Tong Nian.

353
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
These are all my works?

354
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
Yes.

355
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
All the paintings you painted when you were six

356
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
are all my works.

357
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Mom.

358
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

359
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Your sister said she would give you a surprise.

360
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
But a painting

361
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
costs a lot of money.

362
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
I really want to do my best

363
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
to help you realize your dream.

364
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
The whole family raised the money together.

365
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
But I

366
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
dance on the street.

367
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Let's go. I'll show you something.

368
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
Ice Queen.

369
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
This is the work you just completed.

370
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
It's the most beautiful work.

371
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Xiao Fei.

372
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Please live on.

373
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
No matter how painful it is,

374
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
you must live on.

375
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
I will.

376
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
I will live on.

377
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Even if

378
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I can do less and less,

379
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
even if

380
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
my breathing hurts,

381
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
even if I can only live for one day,

382
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
even if I can only live for one day,

383
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
I will live for an hour.

384
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Jin Xi played so well.

385
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
This kind of

386
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
anxiety of wearing ALS

387
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
and the pain of trying to hold it in

388
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
and not wanting to show it

389
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
will bring a strong emotional shock to the audience.

390
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
This will be the most popular movie this year.

391
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
You have such acting skills.

392
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
And you are much better than her.

393
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
But this is not acting.

394
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
So what?

395
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
A good actor

396
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
not only needs to have acting skills,

397
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
but also a sincere heart.

398
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Just watching this part

399
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
can tell that

400
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
Jin Xi wants to

401
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
convey her feelings to the audience.

402
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
So what?

403
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Your rating must be higher than her.

404
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
You should know that comedy

405
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
is always more popular than tragedy.

406
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Although my rating is higher than her,

407
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
my artistic ability is not as good as hers.

408
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Let's not talk about this.

409
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Do you want to try a new dress?

410
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
I specially hired a French designer for you.

411
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
I believe that on the day of the award ceremony,

412
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
you will be the most kind person in the whole scene.

413
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Award ceremony?

414
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
I thought I could win the award.

415
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
But after watching her performance,

416
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
I am really not sure.

417
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
You will win.

418
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
The best actress

419
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
is someone else.

420
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
She deserves it.

421
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Tang Fei,

422
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
it has been a long time. Did you apologize to Jin Xi?

423
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
I didn't do anything wrong.

424
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Why should I apologize?

425
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
I know you didn't do anything wrong.

426
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
But your way of handling

427
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
is too simple and rough.

428
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
If you do this, people will misunderstand.

429
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
What misunderstanding?

430
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Didn't you see Jin Xi has been hiding from you recently?

431
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Your way of liking someone is too strange.

432
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
You like her so much,

433
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
but you don't confess to her.

434
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
If you keep being arrogant,

435
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
she will be taken away by someone else.

436
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Who is so stupid to like her?

437
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
That's not necessarily.

438
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
If she gets the big award,

439
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
she will become a goddess.

440
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Then many people will chase her.

441
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Don't regret it.

442
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Don't regret that I didn't warn you.

443
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Yue Le,

444
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
you are here to see me?

445
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Yes.

446
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Do me a favor.

447
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
What is it?

448
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
I like this design.

449
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
You can choose one.

450
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Choose a dress.

451
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Welcome.

452
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Miss Shen An, long time no see.

453
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
I brought my friend here to see what new designs you have.

454
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
We have many beautiful dresses this year.

455
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
I will go and get them.

456
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
You can have a look.

457
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
What a coincidence.

458
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
Miss Mei,

459
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
I think the design here

460
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
is not suitable for you.

461
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
How about we change it?

462
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
No need.

463
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
You are the one who is fine.

464
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
I am not worried.

465
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Anxin, you have been with me for so long.

466
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
Why are you still so down?

467
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Miss Mei, you are joking.

468
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Anxin,

469
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
help me choose the dress.

470
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
I heard that your movie is in the top.

471
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Congratulations.

472
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Thank you.

473
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
As a newbie,

474
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
it is a great progress to be nominated.

475
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
But my goal is to be the best actress.

476
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
It is good to be confident.

477
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
But don't forget to be humble

478
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
to keep improving.

479
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
All the time,

480
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
I have a question

481
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
to ask you.

482
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Is fame and wealth really that important?

483
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
It can make you

484
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
give up your relatives without hesitation.

485
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
This question has been bothering me for a long time.

486
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
I have no answer.

487
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Do you really want to know the answer?

488
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
You have been kicked out of the door.

489
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
I have already

490
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
given up my hope.

491
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
But I really want to know the answer.

492
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
What can you do

493
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
if you know the answer?

494
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
You can't change the situation.

495
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
Instead,

496
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
you should forget the past

497
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
and live a good life.

498
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
You said that you gave up your hope

499
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
but it is a lie.

500
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
You have no hope, no doubt.

501
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Anxin,

502
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
I will tell you again.

503
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I can't accept you.

504
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Auntie,

505
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
do you think my dress is beautiful?

506
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Yes, it is beautiful.

507
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
The world is so small.

508
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
We meet again.

509
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Jianxi.

510
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Jianxi.

511
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
It is really beautiful.

512
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Jianxi.

513
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Jianxi.

514
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Jianxi.

515
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
I didn't expect them to be here.

516
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
I am sorry.

517
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
I was too impulsive.

518
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
It is my fault.

519
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
I shouldn't have brought you here.

520
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
I won't do it again.

521
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
What she said is right.

522
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
I said I didn't care.

523
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I didn't let go of it.

524
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Jianxi.

525
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Meizhuang, she is not that bad.

526
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
You want to say she has her difficulties?

527
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
I used to lie to myself.

528
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
But I won't do it again.

529
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Her only difficulty

530
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
is not knowing how to explain

531
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
my existence to her husband and others.

532
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
She never thought about the mission.

533
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Why should she be self-satisfied?

534
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Jianxi.

535
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
I will hold my hope.

536
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
I will not be sad.

537
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
I will remember this sentence.

538
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Anxin.

539
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Don't worry.

540
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
I won't follow those

541
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
without results.

542
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
This time,

543
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
I must get the best female lead.

544
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
I want her to see my value.

545
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
I believe

546
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
you will succeed.

547
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Goodbye.

548
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
What's up?

549
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
I'm going to the movie festival tomorrow.

550
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
I know.

551
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
I want you to go with me.

552
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
Sorry, I don't have the time.

553
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Why?

554
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Don't you want me to win?

555
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
I'm busy.

556
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Where are you going?

557
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I'm going to participate in a movie with China and America.

558
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
Because it's too early,

559
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
I have to rush over tomorrow to prepare.

560
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
Are you going to leave me?

561
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
You have an assistant.

562
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
You don't need me at all.

563
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Then...then when are you coming back?

564
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
After the project is completed,

565
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
I will stay there to continue the construction.

566
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
What?

567
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Yes. I won't come back to bother you.

568
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
From now on, you can live your life as you wish.

569
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Don't worry about me coming to bother you.

570
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
No one will bother you behind your back.

571
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
You will be very happy.

572
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
You...

573
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
It's late. Go back and rest.

574
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
You...

575
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Brother Mu.

576
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Zuo Zuo.

577
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Take care.

578
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
I'm going to participate in a movie with China and America.

579
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
Because it's too early,

580
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
I have to rush over tomorrow to prepare.

581
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
After the project is completed,

582
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I will stay there to continue the construction.

583
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
From now on,

584
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
I will live my life as I wish.

585
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
I'm going to leave you.

586
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
I'm going to leave you.

587
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
I'm going to leave you.

588
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
I'm going to leave you.

589
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
I'm going to leave you.

590
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
I'm going to leave you.

591
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
I'm going to leave you.

592
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
From now on,

593
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
you can live your life as you wish.

594
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Don't worry about me coming to bother you.

595
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
Why are you still awake?

596
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Why did you run off without your slippers?

597
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
You are too willful.

598
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
You will catch a cold easily.

599
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Brother Mu.

600
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Don't leave.

601
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
Don't go to America.

602
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Okay?

603
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Zuo Zuo.

604
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
I will never let you go.

605
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
I will never.

606
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Why?

607
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Because I don't want to be alone.

608
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
I don't want to stay here alone.

609
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
If you leave,

610
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
who will go to me

611
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
when I'm sad?

612
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Who will carry me home

613
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
when I'm drunk?

614
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
Zuo Zuo.

615
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Mu Gong.

616
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
Mu Gong, I...

617
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
I was wrong.

618
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
It's my fault.

619
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
It's all my fault.

620
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
I was willful and selfish.

621
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
I will never scold you again.

622
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
I will never say anything about you again.

623
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
I will never laugh at you again.

624
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Don't leave, okay?

625
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Don't leave me here alone.

626
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
I'm serious.

627
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Go to bed early.

628
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Don't say these silly things here.

629
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
Don't leave.

630
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
Don't go.

631
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
You promised me

632
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
that you would go to the movie festival with me.

633
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
You said you would watch me win the award.

634
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
You've been with me

635
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
since I was a kid.

636
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Anyone can leave.

637
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
But...

638
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
How can you...

639
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
leave me?

640
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
When my mom left,

641
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
didn't you promise her

642
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
that you would never leave me?

643
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
You will always take care of me.

644
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
You will always take care of me.

645
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Do you remember?

646
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Yes.

647
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
I did promise you.

648
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
But now you've grown up.

649
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Don't always drink and save yourself.

650
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Don't always drink and save yourself.

651
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
If you get caught by the reporters,

652
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
everything you have will be taken down.

653
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I will never be with you forever.

654
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
You have to learn to deal with things maturely.

655
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
But I...

656
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
I need you.

657
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
I need you.

658
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Zuo Zuo.

659
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
You're just too close to me.

660
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
You don't really need me.

661
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Loneliness.

662
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Because you lost your mother when you were a kid.

663
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
You've been busy since then.

664
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
You've been busy since then.

665
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
So you're so willful.

666
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
You think everything in the world belongs to you.

667
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
If something goes wrong,

668
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
you will be in a big trouble.

669
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Others don't understand you.

670
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
I understand.

671
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
You don't know how to get along with others.

672
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
You're just domineering and willful.

673
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
You're just domineering and willful.

674
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
And you're being watched by others.

675
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
So I've been protecting you.

676
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
I love you.

677
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
I want to make up for what you've lost.

678
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
I've been too high-minded.

679
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
I can't be your brother forever.

680
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
I can't be your servant forever.

681
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
You...

682
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
What are you talking about?

683
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
I don't understand.

684
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
Zuozhu.

685
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
You know I love you.

686
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
I love you.

687
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
I've always loved you.

688
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I just want to tell myself

689
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
no matter how you scold me,

690
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
I won't leave you.

691
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Until one day,

692
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
I found out that the person you like is Ke Lu.

693
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
No.

694
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
It's not like that.

695
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
It's really not like that.

696
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Ke Lu is quite outstanding.

697
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
You should like him.

698
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
It's really not like that.

699
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
I can't stay by your side.

700
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
I can't stay by your side.

701
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Because I'll be in great pain.

702
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Don't scold me.

703
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
Don't leave me.

704
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
You can't leave me.

705
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
There will be more and more people who like you.

706
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
It's okay if I'm not there.

707
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
But no matter where I go,

708
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
I'll be watching you.

709
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
I'll be blessing you.

710
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Don't go!

711
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
I don't want you to go!

712
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Don't go!

713
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Zuozhu.

714
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Didn't you always say

715
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
I was a dog

716
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
behind your ass?

717
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
You're a dog behind your ass.

718
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
You're a dog behind your ass.

719
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,560
You're a dog behind your ass.

720
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,320
You're a dog behind your ass.

721
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
You're a dog behind your ass.

722
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
You're a dog behind your ass.

723
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
I just want to cry.

724
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
Please don't go.

725
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
Please don't go.

726
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:10,060
Please

727
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,820
Group Queen,

728
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,060
But he told me last night that he would leave today.

729
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,420
Brother Mo.

730
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,220
Aunt.

731
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,900
I'm ready to go.

732
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,820
Isn't it too early?

733
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,220
I have an appointment with some friends.

734
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,020
We'll leave early to catch a train.

735
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,060
It's not easy to block the train.

736
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,180
That's good.

737
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,980
Aunt is going to the movie festival today.

738
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,140
So she can't see you off.

739
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,340
As for your uncle, you know that

740
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,100
he doesn't like this kind of farewell.

741
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,660
He won't show up.

742
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,820
I know.

743
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,220
Are you really leaving?

744
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,500
Get out of here.

745
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,300
I don't want to see you again.

746
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,580
Zuo.

747
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,500
Zuo.

748
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,220
Brother Lu.

749
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,380
Are you really not going to come back?

750
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,820
Don't you regret it?

751
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,500
Aunt.

752
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,220
I've made up my mind.

753
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,580
Okay.

754
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,980
Have a safe trip.

755
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,060
Please tighten this part a little bit.

756
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,420
Don't let it get too tight.

757
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,660
Okay. No problem.

758
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,900
Why is he here?

759
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
Shen Yan is an actor in the company.

760
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,300
And he also wants to participate in the movie festival's selection.

761
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,580
Why can't he use the company's resources?

762
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,820
I almost forgot.

763
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,220
He is also the candidate for the best female supporting role.

764
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,140
But

765
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,940
the female supporting role always has to give way to the female leading role.

766
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,220
I'm going to change my clothes now.

767
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,900
You guys get out of my way right now.

768
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,260
Everything has to come first.

769
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,860
Shen Yan came first.

770
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,540
Why are you so overbearing?

771
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,820
And

772
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,620
you're not an actor in the company anymore.

773
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,060
I'm sorry.

774
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,740
My dad has a company's shares.

775
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,700
You're lying.

776
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,740
I'm lying. What's wrong?

777
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,300
I've always thought that my clothes are not the right size.

778
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,540
I'm going out to change. It's too late.

779
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,860
Please help me change it.

780
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,300
Okay?

781
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

782
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,140
I'll help Miss Zuo first.

783
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,980
I'll be right back.

784
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,620
You can't go.

785
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,460
Five minutes is enough. Wait a minute.

786
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,820
Ke Le said he was going to pick me up.

787
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,540
You go down and wait for him.

788
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,460
Tell him I need a while.

789
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,580
Go ahead.

790
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,500
Okay.

791
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,460
Why are you here?

792
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,820
I want to see you pick up the goods.

793
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,260
Let's go.

794
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,500
Get in the car.

795
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,100
Get in the car.

796
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,860
It's you.

797
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,820
I have no time.

798
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,860
Now?

799
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,300
That's good. Thank you.

800
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,020
Okay.

801
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,660
No thanks.

802
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,180
Thank you.

803
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,900
Yan.

804
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:13,980
Yan.

805
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,100
I told you not to come to me.

806
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,580
If others see you,

807
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,540
it will be troublesome if the reporters take pictures of you.

808
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,620
I gave you money.

809
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,740
Why are you here again?

810
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,700
Yan.

811
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,780
Your mother is seriously ill now.

812
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,300
She just wants to see you.

813
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,700
Can't you go to the hospital?

814
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,180
Dad, I told you.

815
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,260
I got the title of the best female role

816
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,180
by myself.

817
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,900
If I don't go to the award ceremony,

818
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,980
I will quit automatically.

819
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,540
You don't want me to leave, do you?

820
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,500
Yan.

821
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,740
What is more important than your mother?

822
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,300
Yes.

823
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,540
But my mother is ill.

824
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,900
It's not a few days.

825
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,500
I can go to the hospital tomorrow morning.

826
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,860
But the doctor has said

827
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,060
your mother is very ill now.

828
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,540
I'm afraid she can't wait until tomorrow.

829
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,100
Yan.

830
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,500
Just listen to me.

831
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,940
Just take it as my father begging you.

832
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,700
Okay? Yan.

833
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,340
You just go to the hospital.

834
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,180
Your mother really wants to see you for the last time.

835
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,740
No.

836
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,140
I must go to the award ceremony.

837
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,460
What time is it, Yan?

838
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,580
Are you going too far?

839
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,380
Dad, you don't need to say anymore.

840
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,020
It will be too late if you go on.

841
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,380
I'm going to put on makeup now.

842
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,820
Once the award ceremony is over,

843
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,100
I will go to the hospital immediately.

844
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,380
No.

845
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,420
I will never listen to you today.

846
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,020
Anyway,

847
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,460
you must go to the hospital with me now.

848
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,100
Dad.

849
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,660
Go now.

850
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,420
Don't pull me.

851
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,620
Don't pull me, dad.

852
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,260
Let go of me.

853
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,780
Yan, run.

854
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,460
Let go of me.

855
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,300
Dad.

856
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,700
Dad.

857
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,180
Dad.

858
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,660
Dad.

859
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,620
Dad.

860
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,660
Dad.

861
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,500
Dad.

862
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:46,780
Dad.

863
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,780
Hurry, Yan.

864
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
Is there anyone?

865
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,300
Dad.

866
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,300
Someone fell down.

867
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:50,820
Help.

868
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,500
Yan.

869
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,420
Yan.

870
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,900
Don't scare me, dad.

871
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,420
What's wrong?

872
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,580
Dad, wake up.

873
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,140
Hurry.

874
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,980
Wake up.

875
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,140
I don't want to see him.

876
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,460
It's him.

877
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,300
It's him.

878
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,100
Zuo Zuo.

879
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,820
You pushed my dad down the stairs.

880
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,060
It's you.

881
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,060
It's not me.

882
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,900
How can you do this to me?

883
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,780
It's not me.

884
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,700
It's him.

885
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,100
I pushed him down.

886
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,620
Dad.

887
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,740
It was him who pushed me down.

888
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,700
Yan.

889
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,140
It was him.

890
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
It wasn't me.

891
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,100
Does this look too...

892
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,100
too...

893
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,460
too deliberate?

894
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,940
Deliberate?

895
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,660
Deliberate.

896
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,260
I should make it a little looser.

897
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,260
A little bit of a lazy beauty.

898
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,820
But today

899
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,500
seems to be a formal occasion.

900
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,900
It's because it's a formal occasion

901
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,300
that it's more casual.

902
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,740
It's going to make people feel like...

903
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,020
Why is it so casual and pretty?

904
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,660
And this hair

905
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,020
should be looser.

906
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,540
It looks sexy like this.

907
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,260
I don't think I have anything to do with sexiness.

908
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,900
You really have nothing to do with it.

909
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
But we have to wear high heels.

910
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,060
Yeah.

911
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,220
I didn't even see high heels.

912
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,260
Where did they go?

913
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,620
I remember.

914
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,140
You put them in the car and took them.

915
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,940
I'll go get them.

916
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,060
I'll go with you.

917
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,900
How can you go in that?

918
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,380
Hurry up.

919
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,020
Practice.

920
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,820
I'll be right back.

921
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,580
Hello?

922
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,180
I said I won't go tonight.

923
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,860
Why are you picking me up?

924
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,660
You don't have to go there yourself.

925
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,540
You don't have to pick me up.

926
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,540
I said I'll go there myself.

927
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,820
You don't have to pick me up tonight.

928
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,940
Okay. That's it.

929
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,580
Let's go.

930
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,180
Go to the right of the living room.

931
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,620
There's a table here.

932
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,820
Put a bunch of flowers.

933
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,340
The balloons on the ground

934
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,700
don't have to be too full to walk.

935
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,020
In addition to the balloons on the ground,

936
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,980
put some green balloons

937
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,100
on the ceiling.

938
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,860
There are candles on the side of the tea table

939
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,900
and the table.

940
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,700
Go around.

941
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,900
It's better to put them on.

942
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,620
Okay.

943
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,540
Okay.

944
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,140
And these tea tables

945
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,900
and the table next to the sofa

946
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,500
are all full of roses.

947
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,380
I've already put the roses

948
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,740
on the side for you.

949
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,260
You can move them later.

950
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,740
Okay.

951
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,100
Remember it.

952
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,380
You can only go there after 7.30.

953
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,340
Don't be too late.

954
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,500
And be careful.

955
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,780
Don't touch anything in the house.

956
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:50,740
Okay.

957
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,620
Do you remember?

958
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,180
Yes.

959
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,740
Okay.

960
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,460
Go back to the next room.

961
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,580
Okay.

962
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,660
Excuse me.

963
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,020
Please go upstairs

964
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,740
and have a rest.

965
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,460
Okay.

966
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,020
Okay.

967
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,660
Thank you.

968
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,540
Why are you here?

969
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,140
I...

970
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,460
I have a hair loss at your house.

971
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,740
I want to go in and look for it.

972
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,260
Come in.

973
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,660
The power is out.

974
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,740
The power is out.

975
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,100
Really?

976
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,060
How come?

977
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,580
I heard from Mr. Wu this afternoon

978
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,460
that the power is being fully restored.

979
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,580
Really?

980
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,620
I remember that

981
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,300
this neighborhood has never had such a thing.

982
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,460
I have a small power outlet.

983
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,380
Wait.

984
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,660
I remember it's here.

985
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,980
You don't?

986
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,500
No.

987
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,380
Look at this.

988
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,060
I remember I put it here last time.

989
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,020
Maybe you remembered it wrong.

990
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,980
It's really not here.

991
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,180
Impossible.

992
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,980
I'll look for it.

993
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:17,860
Say it.

994
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,120
Man Hu, are you free this morning?

995
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,440
I have a business to attend to.

996
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,420
You...

997
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:36,220
Are you free today?

998
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,300
No.

999
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:39,960
What?

1000
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,960
Today is my birthday.

1001
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,900
Today is your birthday.

1002
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,300
It's very soon.

1003
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,280
You didn't tell me about your empty files.

1004
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,260
Why are you still not home today?

1005
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:56,260
The moon shines a little bit brighter tonight

1006
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,260
With loneliness and my endless loyalty

1007
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,260
Look at the prosperity and the silence

1008
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,260
Look at loneliness and the frost

1009
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,260
Look at the tide and the cold and the cold

1010
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,260
The sky is dark and the sky is bright

1011
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,260
There are too many people

1012
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,260
There are too many expectations

1013
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,260
In the end, there is despair

1014
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,260
Look at you coming and going

1015
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,260
Hugging the wind and frost

1016
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,260
All are wandering

1017
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,260
Too stubborn and stubborn

1018
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,260
Young and crazy

1019
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,260
There is a lie that never forgets the fire

1020
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,260
Looking back, there will be regrets

1021
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:53,260
You and I are gradually lost on the road

1022
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:59,260
The typhoon does not think about anything

1023
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:06,260
Where is the heart still going to pretend?

1024
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,260
Just like this, wait for a person to dawn

1025
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:18,260
Just like this, wait for a person to dawn

1026
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,260
Just like this, wait for a person to dawn
