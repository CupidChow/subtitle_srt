1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Miss you

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Love you

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far away

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
At that moment

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
The old age

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,240
Turned into a magical eye

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,920
Pass through the loneliness to find you

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,040
Put on the most solid gold armor

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,920
Hold the weapon in your hand

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Use all your strength to fight for the most real self

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the little tricks

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what rumors

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,080
I will definitely be invincible

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't want you to be willing

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Where is the gold?

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,440
In the past, I kept this sweet

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,760
No matter where your heart is

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,080
My heart is here

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
Even if the world is invincible

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm only one you

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:02,440
The Long Ballad

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,920
Good evening, guests

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,440
Tonight, Gongyule donated 200,000 yuan

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,200
To buy a piano song by Miss Shen Yan

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
200,000 yuan

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,360
200,000 yuan

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,880
Thank you

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,080
I hope to do a great job for charity

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,520
So next, we will give the time to Shen Yan

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm sorry

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm sorry

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm sorry

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm sorry

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm sorry

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm sorry

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm sorry

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm sorry

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm sorry

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm sorry

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm sorry

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm sorry

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm sorry

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm sorry

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm sorry

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm sorry

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
I'm sorry

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
I'm sorry

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm sorry

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm sorry

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm sorry

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I'm sorry

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm sorry

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm sorry

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm sorry

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
I'm sorry

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
I'm sorry

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
I'm sorry

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I'm sorry

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Good evening, everyone

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
In the center, if you want to study,

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,920
You can follow myasa Yihong

70
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,660
Seems like once you know this,

71
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,880
You will get your nous

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Know it?

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,880
What?

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
Taylor Learner

75
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,440
Mr. Lu,

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,800
we can put the things I told you to do so.

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,800
All right. I'll do it right now.

78
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,720
Don't light the fire.

79
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,620
Quick, quick, chamberlain.

80
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,880
Yes, over here.

81
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Take a picture.

82
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,100
A photo.

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,180
Stop doing this,性ish.

84
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,400
Please take a picture.

85
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,920
Come on, miss.

86
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,580
One more.

87
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,160
Miss.

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,680
Is this fake?

89
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Yes.

90
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
What's going on, Miss Qin?

91
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
This is so ridiculous.

92
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
When did this happen, Miss Qin?

93
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Are these all fake?

94
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Who made these bad plays?

95
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
These photos are all fake.

96
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
This is too much.

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
So many.

98
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
This is not me.

99
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Stop taking photos.

100
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Stop taking photos.

101
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Stop taking photos.

102
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Stop taking photos.

103
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,960
This is too much.

104
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Stop taking photos.

105
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
This is not me.

106
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
This is not me.

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Where are you going?

108
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
I just saw the teacher.

109
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
You mean Lu Zhu?

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Yes. He's at the door.

111
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Why didn't I see him?

112
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
This...

113
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
He wouldn't come to this kind of place.

114
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
I think he came

115
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
only for one reason.

116
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Tang Fei, you said...

117
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
What do you want to say?

118
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Nothing.

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Actually, Shen Yan

120
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
saved herself this time.

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
I think you should be happy.

122
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
I just think this is very strange.

123
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
I don't know who

124
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,520
prepared these photos

125
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
and posted them on today's party.

126
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Actually, it doesn't matter who prepared them.

127
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
I think the most important thing now

128
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
is that you play this role well.

129
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm going to the hospital.

130
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Be careful.

131
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Okay.

132
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Thank you.

133
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Bye.

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Bye.

135
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Bye.

136
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Bye.

137
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Good night.

138
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Today I asked you all over here.

139
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Why? Tell me the reason.

140
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,120
Director Li, haven't you always not found a suitable candidate?

141
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,620
In the end, you even asked Shen Yan to play the role of Rong Ling.

142
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,820
This... Shen Yan can't do a duet with Jian Xi.

143
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,520
Rong Ling also has no charm to play.

144
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,620
This will drag the whole movie down.

145
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Ji Qing, I don't need to do a duet with Jian Xi.

146
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,320
Also, I can work hard.

147
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,920
Yes, you can work hard, but this has nothing to do with me.

148
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,020
Director, please give me a little more time.

149
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,920
I will definitely play the role well.

150
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,420
I acknowledge every hardworking actor,

152
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,920
but I will never accept a low-class partner like you.

153
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,820
Ji Qing, what do you mean?

154
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,120
Didn't what happened yesterday prove everything?

155
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,620
You've been lying.

156
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,020
In order to defeat your opponent, you got the role of Rong Ling.

157
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,320
You created such a big scandal,

158
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,820
and you even completely ruined your opponent's future.

159
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,520
Ji Qing.

160
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,020
Today is Jian Xi, who will be next?

161
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,820
I feel scared to work with someone like him.

162
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,420
Ji Qing, you don't have the right to be the role.

163
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,620
Moreover, Director and President Qi are both here.

164
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,820
You can't be so unprofessional.

165
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,220
If you don't leave, I will.

166
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,820
Director, thank you for your care and guidance.

167
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,220
Please contact us for further information.

168
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,620
I won't let the crew suffer any loss.

169
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,020
Wait.

170
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,620
Ji Qing is right.

171
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,820
I can't accept you anymore.

172
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,020
Director Li.

173
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,620
You're fired.

174
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,020
No.

175
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
No.

176
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,020
Director Li, President Ji has an investment.

177
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,620
He promised me that he would give me an important role.

178
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,820
Stop talking to my father.

179
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,620
As long as I say something,

180
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,220
he will never stand on your side.

181
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,420
Director Li, give me another chance. I will work hard.

182
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,220
Even if I don't play Rong Ling, I can play Zhen Fei.

183
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,420
Your behavior is too evil.

184
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,820
Our crew can't let you do this.

185
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,020
How could this happen?

186
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,420
Those are all conspiracy.

187
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,820
How could you believe the rumors?

188
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,620
I am innocent. I am innocent.

189
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,620
You will regret it.

190
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,820
President Ji. President Ji.

191
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,420
Let me go.

192
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,220
President Ji, you must help me.

193
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,220
Miss Shen, this is the office. Please don't do anything to your identity.

194
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,020
Let go.

195
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,020
President Ji, those photos are all fake.

196
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,820
Someone framed me on purpose.

197
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,420
Director Li wants me to leave the crew.

198
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,620
I don't want to lose this role.

199
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,020
I don't want to lose this role.

200
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
Miss Shen.

201
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,020
Get up.

202
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,420
This matter was already known to everyone.

203
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,820
Even my daughter knew about it.

204
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,620
I think you are asking for it.

205
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,820
I am not capable.

206
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
So from today,

207
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,220
please don't come to me again.

208
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,420
Please go home.

209
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,420
Miss Shen, let's go out.

210
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,420
Let go.

211
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,420
I will go by myself.

212
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
I'll go by myself.

213
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,420
Oh, right. Did you hear?

214
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,420
Last night, something big happened.

215
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
What happened?

216
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,420
I heard that Shen Yan

217
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,420
was dancing in the basement bar.

218
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,420
Really?

219
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
Really?

220
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
Really. I saw the picture.

221
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,420
I saw the pores on his face clearly.

222
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Oh my god.

223
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
Really?

224
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,420
He looked so pure.

225
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
I didn't expect that he was like that.

226
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
That's why

227
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,420
he's a dog that can't be bitten.

228
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
Right.

229
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Stop talking. Let's go.

230
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,420
It's you!

231
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,420
You put the picture on purpose, right?

232
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
You've already calculated it.

233
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
You didn't announce it early or late.

234
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,420
You just went to the charity party.

235
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,420
I didn't see it.

236
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,420
You pretend to know nothing.

237
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,420
But you're so cruel.

238
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,420
This has nothing to do with me.

239
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,420
Who else would it be if it wasn't you?

240
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Do you think everyone is as despicable as you?

241
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420
Don't pretend in front of me.

242
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
I have nothing to pretend.

243
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,420
Why should I admit to something I've never done?

244
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,420
Oh, right.

245
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,420
What do you think those pictures are?

246
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,420
They're from He Cheng.

247
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
Why are you so nervous now?

248
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
It's my reputation.

249
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
I'll...

250
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,420
Since you suspect me,

251
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
you can call the media now.

252
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,420
We'll confront them face to face.

253
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,420
And check the pictures.

254
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Are they real or fake?

255
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
You...

256
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Anxin, let's go.

257
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
You can't live on your own.

258
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
This is...

259
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,420
I won't lose to you like this.

260
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
I definitely won't.

261
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Teacher.

262
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,420
Jianxi?

263
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,420
Why are you here?

264
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,420
Teacher, I have something to tell you.

265
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Teacher is going to class soon.

266
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,420
You can go out.

267
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
But...

268
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,420
Go out.

269
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,420
You go out first.

270
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
Then you talk to him.

271
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,420
I'll go.

272
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
Do you want to ask me

273
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,420
if I arranged what happened last night?

274
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
Yes.

275
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
Because I saw it at the concert.

276
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,420
I want to know if you put that picture.

277
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,420
I arranged it.

278
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,420
Jianxi.

279
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,420
Only by exposing Shen Yan's fake mask

280
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,420
will people suspect him.

281
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
Don't forget.

282
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
What he did to you before.

283
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,420
And now.

284
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,420
Everything I did.

285
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
I didn't make any lies.

286
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Including this picture.

287
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,420
It's real.

288
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,420
Is there anything wrong?

289
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,420
These pictures are real.

290
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,420
I admit I used some means.

291
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,420
But I never make falsehood.

292
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
In your heart.

293
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Am I so shameless?

294
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
I didn't mean that.

295
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,420
That's good.

296
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
You just need to remember.

297
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,420
Everything I did.

298
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
It's for your own good.

299
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,420
I hope you can stand in front of the spotlight.

300
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,420
Because of the pressure of society.

301
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,420
The company has already helped you.

302
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,420
Don't do anything.

303
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,420
Wait for a few days.

304
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
Keluo.

305
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,420
What?

306
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,420
I just want to say something.

307
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
You go first.

308
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
I'll be back in a minute.

309
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
Keluo.

310
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
I've lost my way.

311
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,420
I really don't know who is so cruel.

312
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,420
Fake photos.

313
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Now because of this.

314
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
Now because of this.

315
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Rumors are everywhere.

316
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,420
The director wants to change me.

317
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,420
How much did I pay to have today?

318
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,420
But now.

319
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,420
But now everything is over.

320
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
I know.

321
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
I shouldn't have done that to you.

322
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
I'm just jealous of Jianxin.

323
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Jealous of her love for you.

324
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
I really regret it later.

325
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
Why?

326
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,420
Why did you hurt her?

327
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
What do you want me to do?

328
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,420
As long as you admit your relationship with Jianxin.

329
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,420
The direction will change.

330
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Even if they don't believe.

331
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,420
They won't put all the attention on me.

332
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Keluo.

333
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,420
I know.

334
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,420
I know you don't want to hurt Jianxin.

335
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,420
But if you don't do that.

336
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
I will die.

337
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,420
I really will die.

338
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
You still don't give up?

339
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
Jianxin doesn't have this stage.

340
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
She still has Tang Fei.

341
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,420
If I don't have the chance to perform.

342
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,420
I will lose everything.

343
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,420
I don't want to go back to the day of the bar.

344
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
I can't stand it at all.

345
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Don't be so cruel to me.

346
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
Please help me.

347
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Please help me for the last time.

348
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,420
Shen Yan.

349
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,420
Put it down.

350
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,420
Stop acting.

351
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,420
Even if you go back to acting.

352
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,420
You can't act forever.

353
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,420
You will be exposed sooner or later.

354
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,420
Give up this opportunity.

355
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,420
Learn to face yourself honestly.

356
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,420
Face others.

357
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,420
Give up this fake life.

358
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,420
No.

359
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
I can't give up.

360
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,420
I can't.

361
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,420
I tried so hard to get everything.

362
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,420
How can I give it to others?

363
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,420
Ke Lu.

364
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
If you don't help me.

365
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,420
I will jump off from here today.

366
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,420
If you use all these acting skills in the movie.

367
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,420
You would have been generous.

368
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,420
It's a pity.

369
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,420
I'm leaving.

370
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
Where are you going?

371
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
To learn how to be pregnant.

372
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,420
You can do it yourself.

373
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
You can do it yourself.

374
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,420
You don't want to help me.

375
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,420
You all don't want to help me.

376
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
Okay.

377
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,420
I will stand up myself.

378
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Even if the whole world doesn't care.

379
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
I will stand up myself.

380
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,420
Ke Lu.

381
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Yanxi.

382
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
I'm going to leave here.

383
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Where?

384
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,420
I don't want to go.

385
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,420
I don't like acting.

386
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,420
I'm not suitable for acting.

387
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
I really like singing.

388
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
Seeing you work so hard for your dream.

389
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
I'm actually ashamed.

390
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,420
For the so-called interests.

391
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
I gave up my original dream.

392
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,420
So I'm going abroad to study.

393
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
I'm going to dream.

394
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,420
Ke Lu.

395
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,420
Before you leave.

396
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,420
I came to see you.

397
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
I have something to tell you.

398
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,420
No matter what happens in the future.

399
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,420
Don't give up acting.

400
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,420
Even if I'm far away.

401
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
I will always be concerned about you.

402
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,420
I...

403
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,420
I hope you and Tang Fei can continue to be happy.

404
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
As expected.

405
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
Do everything to the end.

406
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
I'm sorry.

407
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
I didn't go to the end.

408
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,420
I'm sorry.

409
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
I didn't go to the end.

410
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
I'm sorry.

411
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,420
I'm leaving.

412
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Ke Lu.

413
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420
What time is your flight?

414
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,420
I'll send you.

415
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,420
No need.

416
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Just send me here.

417
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,420
Why?

418
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
I've been deceived by the illusion.

419
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,420
I did a lot of wrong things.

420
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,420
I'm sorry.

421
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,420
I'm sorry.

422
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,420
But even if I did wrong.

423
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
I regret it.

424
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
I can only move forward.

425
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
There is no way to turn back.

426
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,420
So give me a reason to give up.

427
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Just send it here.

428
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
Ke Lu.

429
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
You have to keep going.

430
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Shen Yan.

431
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,420
Don't accept the interview if this happens.

432
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,420
No.

433
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,420
I have to go.

434
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,420
I have to go.

435
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,420
If you go.

436
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,420
It will only make it worse.

437
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,420
If I don't go.

438
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,420
They will think I'm guilty.

439
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,420
Shen Yan.

440
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,420
Get off.

441
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,420
But.

442
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,420
I want you to get off. Did you hear me?

443
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,420
Okay.

444
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,420
Okay.

445
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,420
Shen Yan.

446
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,420
Shen Yan.

447
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,420
Shen Yan.

448
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Shen Yan.

449
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
Are you okay?

450
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Are you okay?

451
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,420
Say something.

452
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
Shen Yan.

453
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,420
Where are you hurt?

454
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,420
Shen Yan.

455
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
Say something.

456
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
Are you okay?

457
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Call an ambulance.

458
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,420
The ambulance will be here soon.

459
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,420
It's okay.

460
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,420
Hello.

461
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
Say something.

462
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,420
Say something.

463
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,420
What's wrong with you?

464
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Shen Yan.

465
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,420
Who allowed him to hold the press conference?

466
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,420
He insisted.

467
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,420
I just got the news.

468
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,420
He didn't decide it by himself.

469
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,420
He doesn't want to do it.

470
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,420
Are you Zhao Tian Li?

471
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Yes.

472
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,420
I think.

473
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,420
I can't lie to the audience.

474
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,420
At that time.

475
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,420
I had to work three shifts a day.

476
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,420
The money I earned.

477
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,420
Was not enough.

478
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
Mom was still in the hospital.

479
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,420
Waiting for the medical fee.

480
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,420
When I was the poorest.

481
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,420
I could only drink water.

482
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,420
I knew a bar owner.

483
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,420
He said.

484
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,420
He could let me dance and make money.

485
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,420
At that time.

486
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,420
I really needed the money.

487
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,420
So I agreed.

488
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,420
I think.

489
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
As long as I can make money for mom.

490
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,420
To cure.

491
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,420
I can sell shoes.

492
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Not to mention dancing.

493
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
I think.

494
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,420
I'm very lucky.

495
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,420
Why?

496
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,420
Why would someone.

497
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,420
Publish such a photo?

498
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,420
The company thinks.

499
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,420
These photos.

500
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Will ruin my future.

501
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,420
They suggest me to deny.

502
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,420
But I can't lie.

503
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,420
I can't do it.

504
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,420
Actually.

505
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
Shen Yan is really hard.

506
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,420
He has to face the hardships of life.

507
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,420
And the impact of the scandal.

508
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,420
After the incident.

509
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,420
Shen Yan.

510
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,420
He didn't sleep all night.

511
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
After a fierce fight.

512
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,420
He decided to stand out.

513
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
To tell everyone.

514
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,420
What he has been through.

515
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,420
But on the way here.

516
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,420
Shen Yan had a car accident.

517
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,420
He was hurt in many places.

518
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,420
He should have been hospitalized.

519
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
But he insisted.

520
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
To explain to everyone.

521
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,420
Now.

522
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,420
It's all my fault.

523
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,420
I'm causing trouble.

524
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,420
And let my fans down.

525
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,420
I'm disappointed.

526
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,420
I'm sorry.

527
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Really.

528
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,420
Shen Yan.

530
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
It's wonderful.

531
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,420
Shen Yan.

532
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,420
I really underestimated you.

533
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,420
Don't say that.

534
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,420
When I came.

535
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,420
I wanted to deny it.

536
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,420
Thanks to this accident.

537
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,420
I changed my mind.

538
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,420
Really?

539
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
After the accident.

540
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,420
Many people came to care about me.

541
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,420
This makes me feel.

542
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,420
A single denial.

543
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,420
Doesn't work at all.

544
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,420
It will make everyone more curious.

545
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,420
At this time.

546
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,420
I'd rather admit it.

547
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,420
I'll get everyone's forgiveness.

548
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,420
Think about it.

549
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
A poor girl.

550
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,420
For the sake of raising a family.

551
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
She made the wrong decision.

552
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,420
Everyone will understand.

553
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,420
And.

554
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,420
Will think.

555
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,420
I have the courage to admit my mistake.

556
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
You're right.

557
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,420
As long as you admit the past.

558
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
Can win the sympathy of the public.

559
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,420
Isn't it?

560
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,420
I really didn't expect.

561
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
You solved this problem so quickly.

562
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,420
And you did it so perfectly.

563
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,420
All this.

564
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
It's all because of Jian Xi.

565
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,420
I will never.

566
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,420
Forgive him.

567
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,420
Jian Xi.

568
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,420
What's wrong?

569
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,420
The punishment is cancelled.

570
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,420
You can act again.

571
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,420
Really.

572
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,420
Hello, director.

573
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,420
Jian Xi.

574
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,420
What are you doing at home?

575
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
Come to the set.

576
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
Because of your reason.

577
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
The shooting has been delayed for too long.

578
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,420
Come on.

579
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,420
I'll go right away.

580
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Good.

581
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,420
Goodbye, director.

582
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,420
My chin.

583
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,420
Great.

584
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,420
Sorry, everyone.

585
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Because I'm late.

586
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,420
It's okay.

587
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,420
Don't be surrounded.

588
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,420
We have to hurry up.

589
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,420
Get ready.

590
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,420
Director.

591
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,420
Jian Xi, welcome back.

592
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Thank you, director.

593
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,420
Get ready.

594
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
I'll go and say hello to Ji Qing.

595
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
No, don't go.

596
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,420
Why are you looking for him?

597
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,420
Are you friends with him?

598
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,420
Remember, you are rivals.

599
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,420
I think.

600
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,420
Did he talk to you?

601
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,420
Let's go. Hurry up and put on makeup.

602
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,420
Ji Qing, what's wrong with you?

603
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,420
Nothing.

604
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,420
You always hate Shen Yan.

605
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,420
What about Jian Xi?

606
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,420
No.

607
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,420
I'm thinking for myself.

608
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,420
Shen Yan has a good reputation.

609
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,420
No strength.

610
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,420
Not worthy to stand with me.

611
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,420
What I need is not a embroidery pillow.

612
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
But a strong opponent.

613
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,420
So I can become stronger.

614
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
So you're talking about Jian Xi?

615
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,420
He's back.

616
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,420
The real war

617
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,420
has just begun.

618
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
Jian Xi,

619
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,420
we'll shoot the scene of the New Year.

620
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,420
We'll put money in the dumplings.

621
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Whoever eats it will be lucky.

622
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,420
So Rong Ling will eat it.

623
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,420
I see.

624
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,420
Jian Xi, you just went back to the crew.

625
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,420
Get used to it.

626
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Thank you, director.

627
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Get ready.

628
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,420
Still alive?

629
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,420
Not so easy to die.

630
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Then you should cheer up.

631
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,420
Don't look so down.

632
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,420
I don't want to

633
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,420
shoot with you again.

634
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,420
Can you say something nice?

635
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,420
It hurts.

636
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,420
What?

637
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,420
What? I'll eat it.

638
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,420
Or I'll grind your teeth.

639
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,420
Silly.

640
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,420
You curse me?

641
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
I won't eat it.

642
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,420
I have to eat something.

643
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,420
You're not smart.

644
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,420
Sorry.

645
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,420
That's the way he treats others.

646
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,420
Treats?

647
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,420
Zuo Zuo has no friends since childhood.

648
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,420
He doesn't know how to interact with others.

649
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,420
That's the way he treats others.

650
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,420
Don't mind it.

651
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,420
23 scenes, one shot, one kill.

652
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
Action.

653
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
What are you doing?

654
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,420
Eating dumplings.

655
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
Why are you eating so fast?

656
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
It's the new year.

657
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,420
They say if you eat the whole piece

658
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,420
of dumplings, you'll be rich.

659
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,420
You're a little fortune-teller.

660
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,420
Don't eat too fast.

661
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,420
It's bad for your health.

662
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,420
What's wrong?

663
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
Did you choke?

664
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
I ate the whole piece.

665
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
You're so lucky.

666
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,420
I can get pregnant.

667
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,420
Yes.

668
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,420
Sister, look at me.

669
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,420
I ate the whole piece.

670
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,420
Don't eat too much.

671
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,420
Cut.

672
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,420
Cut.

673
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,420
What's wrong?

674
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,420
De Ling and Rong Ling are sisters.

675
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
I can't see the taste of

676
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
being intimate with you two.

677
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,420
Ji Qing, the line you just said

678
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
you don't care about your sister.

679
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
It's like being jealous.

680
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
And you, Jin Xi.

681
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,420
You're too immersed in your performance.

682
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,420
Before the shooting,

683
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
you should care about yourself

684
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,420
and not the play.

685
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,420
You should be smart.

686
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
You should know how to interact with others.

687
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,420
You must act in the play.

688
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
It's not your play.

689
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,420
I understand.

690
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Okay.

691
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Let's do it again.

692
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,420
Okay.

693
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,420
Come on.

694
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
Ready.

695
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
Action.

696
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
I'm so talented.

697
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,420
Sister, look at me.

698
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
I ate the whole piece.

699
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Don't eat too much.

700
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,420
Cut.

701
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,420
What's wrong with you two?

702
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,420
I can't see the taste of being intimate with you two.

703
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
It's not right.

704
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
If you two act awkwardly,

705
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
the audience will also be awkward.

706
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Forget it.

707
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,420
Let's not shoot today.

708
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
Let's not shoot today.

709
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,420
Think about it.

710
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,420
Next scene.

711
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Okay.

712
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Don't move the track.

713
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Okay.

714
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,420
Come here.

715
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,420
What's wrong with him?

716
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,420
Enmity.

717
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
Enmity?

718
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,420
Jin Xi has enmity with me.

719
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,420
It's very strong.

720
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,420
So I can't be intimate with him.

721
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,420
It's too rare.

722
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,420
He can have enmity.

723
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,420
Come on. Ready.

724
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Action.

725
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
30 scenes. One shot. One shot.

726
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,420
Sister.

727
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,420
Jin Xi.

728
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,420
Hold her warmly.

729
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Hold her warmly.

730
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,420
Hurry up.

731
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
What are you hesitating about?

732
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,420
Cut.

733
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,420
What's wrong with you two?

734
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
You can't cooperate at all?

735
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,420
Director. Today...

736
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,420
Forget it. Let's not shoot today.

737
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,420
Give me another chance.

738
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,420
Don't waste time.

739
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
You two don't have any tacit understanding.

740
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,420
Cut.

741
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Director.

742
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,420
The scene is over.

743
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,420
Listen to me.

744
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
Take it.

745
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
Be careful.

746
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,420
Give me the camera.

747
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,420
Go now.

748
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,420
CDC, you are a thunder that stirs things.

749
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,420
Hardships.

750
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,420
Long harvest.

751
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:20,920
The

752
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,420
I mean teammates.

753
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,420
I mean teammates.

754
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Dear contexts.

755
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Dear enrollments.

756
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Alright.

757
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,420
Why are you drinking?

758
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
Ji Qing.

759
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
Ji Qing.

760
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,420
Ji Qing.

761
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
Ji Qing.

762
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,420
Ji Qing, what's wrong with you?

763
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,420
He has outstanding performance skills.

764
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,420
And the spirit of living together.

765
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
I don't have all of these.

766
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,420
No matter he is beaten or beaten to pieces.

767
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,420
He can always come back.

768
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,420
It's not him who chooses to perform.

769
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
It's the performance that chooses him.

770
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,420
Ji Qing, don't be like this.

771
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
I will be surpassed soon.

772
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,420
What are you talking about?

773
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,420
Such spirit and talent.

774
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,420
I want it too.

775
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,420
Ji Qing.

776
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,420
I'm so jealous of him.

777
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,420
I'm really jealous of him.

778
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,420
I've never been so jealous of someone.

779
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
I...

780
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,420
Stand up.

781
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Boss.

782
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Stand up and follow me.

783
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Cheer up.

784
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,420
Let me go.

785
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
Let me go.

786
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,420
Boss, Ji Qing is not feeling well today.

787
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,420
If you're not feeling well, then follow me.

788
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,420
Let me go.

789
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,420
What are you doing? Let me go.

790
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
What am I doing?

791
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,420
I want to ask you what you want to do.

792
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,420
What's wrong with me?

793
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,420
You can't act anymore, right?

794
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
You can't face the test.

795
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,420
You can't act out your sister's love, right?

796
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,420
I will be fine.

797
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,420
I will be fine tomorrow.

798
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,420
No, I will be fine soon.

799
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,420
You don't even have the most basic confidence.

800
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,420
How will you perform in the future?

801
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,420
I'm fine.

802
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,420
You're like this.

803
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
You still say you're fine.

804
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,420
A cold-hearted and ruthless businessman.

805
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
What do you know?

806
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,420
I know you.

807
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,420
You risked your life to suppress the test.

808
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,420
You completely forgot that you were acting as sisters.

809
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,420
Ji Qing, what's wrong with you?

810
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,420
You used to be so confident.

811
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,420
Now you're beaten by him.

812
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,420
I'm really scared.

813
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,420
As long as he's by my side,

814
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
I don't have any confidence.

815
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,420
I've never met a opponent like this.

816
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,420
Never.

817
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,420
Ji Qing, look at me.

818
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,420
No one will take anything away from you.

819
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,420
I won't allow it.

820
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,420
I said it has nothing to do with you.

821
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
Ji Qing.

822
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
As long as it's your business,

823
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

824
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
Don't force me anymore.

825
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
Let me help you, okay?

826
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,420
So?

827
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,420
Are you going to let the best actress perform this night?

828
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,420
Qi Wen Sen,

829
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,420
I'm telling you.

830
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,420
If you really want to do this,

831
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,420
I won't thank you.

832
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,420
And I will hate you even more.

833
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,420
Let's go.

834
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,420
No need to see me off.

835
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,420
Let's go back.

836
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,420
It's okay.

837
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,420
I want to spend more time with you.

838
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
Ji Qing.

839
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,420
Ji Qing.

840
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,420
Ji Qing saw me.

841
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,420
So what?

842
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,420
I sent my girlfriend to the scene.

843
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,420
Who cares?

844
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,420
That's not what I meant.

845
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,420
So what?

846
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,420
It's weird.

847
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,420
I'm not going to let you go.

848
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,420
I'm not going to let you go.

849
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,420
I'm not going to let you go.

850
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,420
I'm not going to let you go.

851
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,420
I'm not going to let you go.

852
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,420
It's weird.

853
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,420
It's nothing.

854
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,420
I'm going to work.

855
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,420
I'll be back early.

856
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,420
Okay.

857
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
Chang Wu, bring the ladder.

858
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
The actors will need it later.

859
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,420
Okay.

860
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,420
We're going to shoot a play

861
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,420
where the two sisters are talking.

862
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
Act well.

863
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Don't mess up again.

864
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
Get ready.

865
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,420
Director,

866
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
do we need to add a little bit of sound?

867
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,420
The investigation is not coming.

868
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Don't worry.

869
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,420
There won't be any problems.

870
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Hurry up and get ready.

871
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,420
Can you do it so high?

872
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
It's okay.

873
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,420
I can get up easily.

874
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,420
You're a little flying blind.

875
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,420
Little swallow.

876
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,420
Let's go.

877
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
Let's go.

878
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,420
It's so beautiful here.

879
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,420
When I was in France,

880
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,420
I used to like to play in the trees.

881
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,420
Life here is too boring.

882
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,420
Just like the old man, the parrot.

883
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,420
It seems to be very happy every day.

884
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,420
Actually,

885
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,420
I was locked in that cage all day.

886
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,420
You,

887
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,420
be careful of the goods coming out of the mouth.

888
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,420
Sister,

889
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,420
look.

890
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
The sparrow.

891
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,420
The sparrow.

892
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,420
Sister.

893
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,420
Why do you exist?

894
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
I hate you, Jixi.

895
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
If it weren't for you,

896
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
Tang Fei would definitely have been mine.

897
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
Be careful.

898
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,420
Jixi.

899
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
Hurry up.

900
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,420
Go and save her.

901
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,420
Jixi, are you okay?

902
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,420
Are you okay, Jixi?

903
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,420
Who?

904
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,420
Sister.

905
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,420
Thank you for saving me today.

906
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,420
Don't think of me too kind.

907
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,420
Shen Yan said,

908
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,420
I envy you.

909
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
I didn't admit it before.

910
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,420
But now I found out,

911
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,420
what he said is true.

912
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,420
What do you mean?

913
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,420
Just now,

914
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,420
the moment you almost fell,

915
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,420
I even thought,

916
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,420
if you weren't in the world,

917
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,420
it would be fine.

918
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
Do you know why?

919
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,420
Before,

920
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,420
I always thought,

921
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,420
I was talented in acting.

922
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,420
But I found out,

923
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,420
you are more talented than me,

924
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,420
and you work harder.

925
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,420
Gradually,

926
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,420
I am going to be surpassed by you.

927
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,420
It's not like that.

928
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,420
I...

929
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,420
Let me finish.

930
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,420
If I don't finish,

931
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm afraid,

932
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,420
I won't have the courage to say it.

933
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,420
This time,

934
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,420
I will not be able to say it.

935
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
I will not be able to say it.

936
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,420
The best actress,

937
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,420
I did win you.

938
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,420
But,

939
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,420
it's not that glorious.

940
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
I really,

941
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,420
I really regret it.

942
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,420
So I made up my mind,

943
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,420
I must win you once.

944
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,420
But,

945
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,420
I didn't expect,

946
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,420
it's not that easy.

947
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,420
And,

948
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,420
the worst thing is,

949
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,420
I like Tang Fei so much,

950
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,420
the person he loves,

951
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
is you.

952
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
This thing,

953
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,420
I only realized this time,

954
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
the feeling of jealousy.

955
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,420
The first time I realized,

956
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,420
the person I love the most,

957
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,420
the feeling of being taken away.

958
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,420
I really, really like acting.

959
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,420
And,

960
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,420
I really love Tang Fei.

961
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,420
But,

962
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,420
I lost everything.

963
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,420
I lost everything,

964
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,420
because of you.

965
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
I can't act well.

966
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,420
Now,

967
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,420
I'm full of jealousy.

968
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,420
I really don't know why,

969
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,420
I became like this.

970
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Ji Qing,

971
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,420
I'm the same.

972
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,420
I've been walking,

973
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,420
I've encountered many setbacks.

974
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,420
Several times,

975
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,420
I was about to leave,

976
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,420
and stayed at last.

977
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,420
You may not know,

978
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,420
I cried many times,

979
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,420
because of you.

980
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
Because I feel that,

981
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,420
I'm nothing compared to you.

982
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,420
I still can't forget the fantasy.

983
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,420
The rain in the fall,

984
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,420
it's like a scar.

985
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,420
The moonlight shines tonight,

986
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,420
it's a little bit bright.

987
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
With this loneliness,

988
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,420
it's like a long story.

989
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,420
Watching the prosperity and prosperity,

990
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,420
watching loneliness turn into frost.

991
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Watching the tide rise and fall,

992
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
the people are warm,

993
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,420
the sky is dark and the sky is bright.

994
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,420
Too many expectations,

995
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,420
in the end, you become desperate.

996
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,420
Watching you come and go,

997
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,420
holding on tightly to the wind and frost,

998
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,420
everything is in a trance.

999
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,420
Too stubborn,

1000
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,420
I have to be young and crazy.

1001
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,420
There is a lie,

1002
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,420
I don't forget the fire.

1003
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,420
Looking back,

1004
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,420
there will be regrets.

1005
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,420
You and I,

1006
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,420
we are lost on the road.

1007
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,420
The sea is crazy,

1008
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,420
don't think about anything.

1009
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,420
The heart is crazy,

1010
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,420
where is the sea?

1011
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,420
It's like this,

1012
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,420
waiting for a day,

1013
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,420
it's like this,

1014
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,420
waiting for a day,

1015
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,420
it's like this,

1016
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,420
waiting for a day.
