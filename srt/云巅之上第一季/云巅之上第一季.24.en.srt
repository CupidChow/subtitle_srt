1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,960
Look at me with strange eyes

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,840
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't want

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far or far away

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
In that moment, in the second year

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will be a magical eye

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,800
Pass through the loneliness to find you

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Hold the weapon in your hand

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,760
Use all your strength to fight against the most real you

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,360
No matter what the little tricks

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what rumors

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,800
I will definitely do it

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,960
The world is invincible

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't want you to be willing

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,320
In the past, I kept the sweet

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,600
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
My heart is here

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
Even if the world is invincible

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,760
I only have you

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
The Legend of Chusen

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,040
You look like your mother when she was young

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,000
Master Zuo, don't say that

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,680
The first time I met your mother was at the set

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,840
At that time, she was not a big star

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,000
Just a little actress

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,600
She was the kind of person who went wherever there was a play

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
For a small role

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,600
I tried to do all the difficult things

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,480
I'm not interested in your love story

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,800
The reason I noticed her

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,560
Is because of her passion for drama

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,040
I have never seen such a strong desire

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
In a girl's eyes

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,040
She has no one more capable of the desire of fame and wealth

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,400
Otherwise, how could she leave her daughter?

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
Zhan Mei is not as unkind as you say

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,560
In my eyes

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120
She is not acting for fame and wealth

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
Master Zuo

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,480
I don't think we need to talk about it anymore

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,240
When I first met her

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,840
She only had a bad acting

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
And a bad acting

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Many people mocked her

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,720
Many things are not in time

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,120
No director can like her

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
But she didn't feel angry

55
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
She didn't sleep or rest

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
She even went to do some very humble work

57
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,240
To try to understand what other people thought

58
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
She kept practicing at night

59
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
She got up at dawn and went to the theater

60
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,960
She was smiling and smiling

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,920
When she met me

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,960
She didn't ask me to give her a role

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,480
She kept asking me

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
How can I play a role well

65
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,520
How can I put my heart and soul into a role

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,880
She kept improving

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,080
She kept adjusting

68
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,120
That's right

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,520
I gave her the first chance

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,720
But

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,800
The real reason she reached her peak

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,760
Is herself

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,160
Because she kept trying

74
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,880
To make her performance good and beautiful

75
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,960
Jianxi

76
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,120
Isn't that what you are today?

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,720
We are different

78
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,680
Look at you

79
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,000
You look the same as her when you were angry

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
What's the difference?

81
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,920
Master Zuo

82
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,600
Stop joking

83
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,280
You can eat all the pain for acting

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,840
Why do you question your own mother?

85
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,360
Let's talk from another angle

86
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
If she didn't treat you like this

87
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,960
Do you think you have the motivation

88
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,200
To be like Jianxi today?

89
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,600
You are the girl from yesterday

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,280
You have the motivation to fight

91
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
Who else can have such a heart?

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,320
At least I won't be cold and ruthless like her

93
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
Sometimes in order to achieve your dream and goal

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,320
You have to be perfect in some things

95
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
Have you ever thought

96
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,440
She might have her own difficulties?

97
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
Enough

98
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,360
Why is she here?

99
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,280
I want you two to make up

100
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,640
Master Zuo said

101
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,880
You have your difficulties

102
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
What are your difficulties?

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
As long as you can tell me the reason

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,440
I only have one reason

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,120
I want to act

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
I wanted to be an actress since I was a kid

107
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
I wanted to appear on the screen

108
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
But everyone told me

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
You can't do it

110
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,480
All women can only go the same way

111
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,440
That's to be honest at home

112
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,280
Be a wife and have children

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,960
But I'm not willing to do it

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,920
I must realize my dream

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,840
No one can stop me

116
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,320
Is this the reason you left home?

117
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,640
Yes

118
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,240
I divorced your father

119
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
Because I have my own pursuit

120
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
You want to abandon your daughter for your own pursuit?

121
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
That's because your grandma

122
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,440
Watch me like a prisoner every day

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
They think I'm open-minded

124
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
And have a mental problem

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,280
My every move

126
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,320
She will tell your father

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,360
Every day

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,040
I live in the prison

129
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,400
With your father's scolding

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,520
I can't stand this kind of life

131
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,040
Like a prison

132
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,160
So I escaped

133
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
Just because of this

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,840
Do you think there are other difficulties?

135
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,200
I just have my own pursuit and ideals

136
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,040
And know what I want

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
And have the ability and talent

138
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,320
And you

139
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,040
And that prison-like home

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,640
For me

141
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,680
It's just a burden

142
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,320
The sooner you get rid of it, the better

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,640
Jixi

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,480
Zhanmei

145
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,040
Zhanmei

146
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,160
When did you know her?

147
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,320
Since she called you mom for the first time

148
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
I knew she was your daughter

149
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,840
At that time

150
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,760
Zhanmei

151
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't be so stubborn, okay?

152
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
She is your daughter

153
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,640
You are her mother

154
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Even if you bow your head for her

155
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
Okay?

156
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,920
I beg you

157
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,440
I will take care of you

158
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,960
They drove me out

159
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,520
They?

160
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
Your father and your grandma

161
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,800
Impossible

162
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,440
My grandma said

163
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,400
She is lying

164
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
I was forced to leave the Jian family

165
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,920
And

166
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,160
Your grandma was afraid that I would take you away

167
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,760
And hide you on purpose

168
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,760
So that I can't even see you

169
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,440
I was looking for you

170
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
Like crazy

171
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,880
As long as I hear any news from you

172
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
I will look for you all over the world

173
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,120
At that time, I was just kicked out

174
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,880
I didn't have much money

175
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,200
I didn't even have a place to live

176
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,520
The saddest time

177
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,600
I walked for three days and three nights

178
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,880
I just wanted to find you as possible

179
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,880
But when I found you

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,280
I just looked at you

181
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,200
And you were taken away by them again

182
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
Run faster

183
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,040
The wind is so strong

184
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,560
It's turning

185
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,640
Xiao Xi is so great

186
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,200
Xiao Xi

187
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
Come, Xiao Xi

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,960
Come, let's go inside

189
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,520
Xiao Xi

190
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,160
Grandma

191
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,200
Xiao Xi

192
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,680
Let me go

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,720
Let me go

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
Let me go to see my daughter

195
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,040
I tell you

196
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,720
Don't harass Jian Xi anymore

197
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,400
She is doing very well now

198
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,760
She is my daughter

199
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,560
I beg you

200
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,520
Let me see her

201
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,640
Go, go with me

202
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,160
Open the door

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
Let me see my daughter

204
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,880
Open the door

205
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,720
Every time I find you

206
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
They transferred you

207
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,040
I finally understand

208
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,280
They don't want me to see you again in this life

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,880
After three years

210
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,360
I realized that I can't go on like this anymore

211
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,760
If I don't give up on you

212
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
My dream

213
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,680
Will never come true

214
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,400
Your sudden appearance

215
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,160
Makes me feel very scared

216
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,040
Because I am a selfish mother

217
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
I don't want to lose everything I have now

218
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,080
I don't want to lose

219
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
The career I finally achieved

220
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,080
Just like you are now

221
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,720
To realize your dream

222
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,320
No matter how hard it is

223
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,440
How difficult

224
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,680
You will never give up

225
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,520
Why are you here

226
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
I just drove here

227
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,080
Mei Xiang

228
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,760
I know you are here

229
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,080
You are not boiled

230
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
So I am taking you back

231
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,280
Make my bed

232
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,480
In case something goes wrong

233
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,520
I willheaded

234
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,480
I will take you back

235
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,200
Sorry

236
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
I just saw you come back.

237
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
You've been following me, right?

238
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Fans are always following their idols.

239
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
That's what you call a heart-to-heart.

240
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Stop pretending. You know everything.

241
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,160
What about the reason you know now? Do you feel better?

242
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
I feel even worse.

243
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Why?

244
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
I don't know if I should forgive him.

245
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,160
He's really hateful, but...

246
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Jingxi, I think you should forgive him.

247
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Because he has his reasons?

248
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Can he say such harsh words to me?

249
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
He can hurt my heart and say sorry to me.

250
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,160
It seems that my heart can be restored, right?

251
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,160
This is the heart, not the stone.

252
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Jingxi.

253
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
No need to say more.

254
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Yes, Mei.

255
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Mei, do you have anything to say?

256
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Miss Jian, let's have an interview.

257
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Let's share your thoughts.

258
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
I'm sorry, I have to shoot.

259
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Miss Jian, come here.

260
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Come on.

261
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
Let's talk about it later.

262
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
You two are mother and daughter.

263
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
What's your feeling? Tell us.

264
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Jingxi is a talented actress.

265
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm very happy to have a chance to work with her.

266
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I heard that you two didn't get along well in the studio.

267
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Someone saw you two arguing. Is that true?

268
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Yes, Jingxi.

269
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
People say you play the big role.

270
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
You don't respect your seniors when you're famous. Is that true?

271
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
I...

272
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Really?

273
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,160
You reporters have a lot of imagination.

274
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,160
When we were working on the interview, we were very serious and dedicated.

275
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Our so-called dispute was just a word against the stage.

276
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
They said we didn't get along well.

277
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,160
But the person who spread the rumors was really too exaggerated.

278
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,160
But this news will have a certain impact on the actress who is in her prime.

279
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,160
So I hope you can ask me in person if you have any questions.

280
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Don't make any guess.

281
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
In case of misunderstanding.

282
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Thank you. Thank you.

283
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Thank you.

284
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Okay.

285
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Okay. Stop.

286
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Jingxi.

287
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
I've told you many times.

288
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
You don't feel right.

289
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
It's a cheerful song.

290
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
You still don't understand.

291
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Forget it.

292
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
We've filmed so many scenes today.

293
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
You go back and think about it.

294
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
You're tired, too.

295
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Okay?

296
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Come on, all departments.

297
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Get ready.

298
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Let's go. Get ready.

299
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Okay.

300
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Come here to change clothes.

301
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
Okay.

302
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Mr. Music Team, come down and teach us how to change clothes.

303
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Okay.

304
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Please help us to hand over the props outside.

305
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Thank you.

306
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
Okay.

307
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Yun Duo is a complicated girl.

308
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,160
She came out of nowhere to find her mother.

309
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,160
But she was forced by life.

310
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
She couldn't be a singer in Bailanmen.

311
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,160
So there's always a kind of unspeakable affection on her face.

312
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
That's unreliable sadness.

313
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
And the indescribable confusion.

314
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
And your performance just now.

315
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,160
You completely forgot her sorrow.

316
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
What should I do?

317
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Laughing is her current emotion.

318
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
You've changed.

319
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Why are you telling me this all of a sudden?

320
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
You want me to thank you, don't you?

321
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
No.

322
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Jiaxi.

323
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
I'm not here to ask for your forgiveness.

324
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
I just want to tell you.

325
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,160
I wanted to give up my dream.

326
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
To be a good mother.

327
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,160
But I'm really...

328
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
I told myself.

329
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
This is not me.

330
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
This is not what I want.

331
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
I think about it every day.

332
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
I hope one day my dream will come true.

333
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,160
But for you, I've been patient.

334
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,160
I lost my parents when I was very young.

335
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,160
For life, I had to marry your father.

336
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
But he can't understand me.

337
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
He just treats me as a private property.

338
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,160
You don't know how painful it is to tie two people who have no communication together.

339
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Every day, every minute, every second is a torture.

340
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Are you happy now?

341
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Yes.

342
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
After leaving the Jian family.

343
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,160
I know what is free breathing.

344
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Although it's very hard.

345
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
But every day when I open my eyes.

346
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,160
I can work hard for my dream.

347
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,160
I hope one day.

348
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
I can understand you.

349
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Jianxi, I want to change the lines here.

350
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Okay.

351
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Why are you here again?

352
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm Jianxi's agent.

353
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
As long as she doesn't say anything and I don't take her.

354
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I won't leave.

355
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Why?

356
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Lu Zhou, I tell you.

357
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
As long as I take Jianxi one day.

358
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
I will be responsible for her one day.

359
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
I don't know what you think.

360
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,160
But these things have nothing to do with me.

361
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Xiong Zhen is here.

362
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
They are good.

363
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
They are much better.

364
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
I'm coming.

365
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I go to make up for the weight.

366
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
Okay.

367
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Tang Fei.

368
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
You let them meet each other.

369
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
What do you want to say?

370
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Do you really think this is good for Jianxi?

371
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I don't know what you want.

372
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
I just want her to live a happy life.

373
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Do you know what you are doing?

374
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,160
You are destroying Jianxi's acting career.

375
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Tang Fei, don't listen to him.

376
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
I think you are right.

377
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Let Jianxi and Mei be together.

378
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
It will help her.

379
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
I support you.

380
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Yes.

381
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
This man is so strange.

382
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I don't know what he is thinking.

383
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Why are you looking at me?

384
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Why are you looking at me?

385
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
Is there something on my face?

386
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
When did you become enemies?

387
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
I and him.

388
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Why are you learning me to talk?

389
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
You are learning me, okay?

390
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Then why don't you talk?

391
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Jianxi.

392
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Mei asked me to dinner.

393
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Do you want to go?

394
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
I know I am not the one she wants to see.

395
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,160
But the key is whether you want to go or not.

396
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I am not ready yet.

397
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Give me some time.

398
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I understand.

399
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
I will wait for you at the parking lot.

400
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Call me when you come out.

401
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Teacher, why did you ask me to come here?

402
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
You will know when you see it.

403
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
Xiao Nian, let's go in, okay?

404
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
The doctor said you can't play outside.

405
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Your toys are inside.

406
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Let's go in, okay?

407
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Good boy, let's go in.

408
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Dr. Lin, how is Xiao Nian?

409
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,160
If we can't find the donor of the blood-dried liver,

410
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
the situation is not optimistic.

411
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Thank you.

412
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Why did you bring me here?

413
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
You saw it.

414
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Don't you understand?

415
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
I'm not going.

416
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
I will go with you.

417
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
I won't let you go alone.

418
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
I will go with you.

419
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
I will go with you.

420
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Hurry up.

421
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Okay.

422
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Hello.

423
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Don't make any noise.

424
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
I am here.

425
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I am here.

426
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
I am here.

427
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
I am here.

428
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
I am here.

429
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
I'll go first.

430
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Anxin, is Jinxi ready?

431
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
She hasn't arrived yet.

432
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
What are you doing?

433
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
The shooting is about to start.

434
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Everyone is waiting for her.

435
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I kept calling to urge you.

437
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Maybe something happened.

439
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Hurry up.

440
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
I know. I'm sorry.

441
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
I'll leave this to me.

442
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
I'll leave this to you.

443
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
I'll leave this to you.

444
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
I'll leave this to you.

445
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Anxin.

446
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
What's wrong with Jinxi?

447
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
She's probably stuck on the road.

448
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
She should be here soon.

449
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I'm coming.

450
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Jinxi.

451
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Jinxi, are you okay?

452
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
I'm fine.

453
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Come on.

454
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Today is the birthday of Sheng Xue Lin.

455
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Yun Duo has forgiven his mother from the bottom of his heart.

456
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
He wants to give her a surprise.

457
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
So he learned magic from Li Changfeng.

458
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,160
This scene is the most touching part of our movie.

459
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Jinxi, are you ready?

460
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,160
You two are working very well together.

461
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Just like real mother and daughter.

462
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
I'm very confident in our movie.

463
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Come on.

464
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Okay, get ready.

465
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Go to the gallery.

466
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
I'll go with you.

467
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I'm very happy that you can make up.

468
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Don't worry.

469
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Okay.

470
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Mr. Qi, you called me so urgently.

471
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Take a look.

472
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Mr. Qi, this is...

473
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
It used to be just rumors.

474
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Now the evidence is solid.

475
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Even if it's true, it's nothing.

476
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
You're wrong.

477
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
It's not complicated.

478
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,160
But there's a better way to destroy Jinxi.

479
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
What do you want?

480
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,160
The heroine of Rose's life.

481
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
And everything you want.

482
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
I'll help you get it all back.

483
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,160
As long as it's for you, I can do anything.

484
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Jinxi, we have an interview to do later.

485
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Anxin, my phone is too long.

486
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Help me find it.

487
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Okay.

488
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Good.

489
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Good.

490
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Good.

491
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Good.

492
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Good.

493
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Yun Duo said he wanted to give you a gift today.

494
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
A gift?

495
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
He wants to give you a surprise.

496
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
What's going on?

497
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Who's this?

498
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
What's going on?

499
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Isn't the prop wrong?

500
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
No, it's okay.

501
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Look.

502
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
What's going on?

503
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
This is a letter.

504
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
This is a letter?

505
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,160
Cut! What are you doing?

506
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Say something!

507
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Cut the letter.

508
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Tang Fei.

509
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Do you like the gift I gave you?

510
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Your attitude has changed.

511
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Because Zuo Nian is sick,

512
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
you haven't found a suitable match.

513
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,160
And I am your last hope.

514
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
It's not like that.

515
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
I have already seen Zuo Nian in the hospital.

516
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
What else is there to hide?

517
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,160
I'm telling you, I won't forgive you.

518
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
As for whether I go to the match,

519
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,160
let me think about it.

520
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Anxin!

521
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
You are the one who is behind this.

522
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,160
I just want to let Jian Xi know the truth.

523
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
You are hurting her, do you know that?

524
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Is hiding the truth

525
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
for the good of Jian Xi?

526
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Is this how things are going?

527
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Are you happy that you hurt Jian Xi?

528
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Anxin!

529
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
This is a scam.

530
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
This is not a family thing!

531
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
What are you doing?

532
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
I'll go back to the company now.

533
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
You go home and look for her.

534
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Okay, let's go.

535
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Do I really want to save Zuo Nian?

536
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Zuo Nian is innocent.

537
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,160
If I don't save him this time,

538
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,160
what's the difference between me and Zhan Nian?

539
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Qi Wen Sen, what are you doing?

540
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,160
What are you doing?

541
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,160
I'm just helping you.

542
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Helping me?

543
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,160
No need, I don't need your help.

544
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Jian Xi is still hesitant about going to the match.

545
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
If no one persuades her,

546
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
what will Xiao Nian do?

547
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
It's just a public relationship.

548
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
After attracting public attention,

549
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
even if Jian Xi doesn't go to the match,

550
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,160
you still have a chance to find a suitable match.

551
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Put that on your back.

552
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Has he?

553
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,160
No.

554
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
What's going on?

555
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Nothing.

556
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Go first.

557
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
Let me see it.

558
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
I'm good.

559
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Don't move.

560
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Don't rush. You'll find him.

561
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Oh, I remember now.

562
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
What?

563
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I don't know if Lu Zhou is giving you a hard time

564
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
or what kind of fruit he gave you.

565
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Why are you only telling him everything now

566
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
and not telling me?

567
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
And I found that you only believe him now

568
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
and not me.

569
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Why?

570
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
If you are here to scold me,

571
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,160
then you can leave.

572
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
I just don't understand

573
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
why you suddenly became like this.

574
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I'm telling you, Lu Zhou

575
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
will not do something simple.

576
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Everything he did was just to control you.

577
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Control your thoughts.

578
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Don't you understand?

579
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
I only know that he is genuinely thinking about me.

580
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
At least let me know the truth of the matter.

581
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Okay.

582
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Even if you don't understand me,

583
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
can you think about your mother?

584
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,160
The matter has come to this point.

585
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
Now I'm not interested in what he says.

586
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
I told you from the beginning

587
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
that Lu Zhou is a person with a heart.

588
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
If you really think about me,

589
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
then don't interfere with my decision.

590
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
I have an interview later.

591
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
I'm leaving.

592
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Miss Jian,

593
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
we just talked so much.

594
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I'm really happy.

595
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
You are currently

596
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
the hottest actress.

597
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,160
The outside world knows little about your situation.

598
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Would you like to talk to us?

599
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Before being an actress,

600
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
I was a very ordinary girl.

601
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
I didn't have any stories.

602
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
So...

603
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
I don't have anything to talk about.

604
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Ordinary?

605
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
No.

606
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
You are not ordinary at all.

607
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Jian Xi is the famous actress,

608
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Zhan Mei's biological daughter.

609
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Is it true, Jian Xi?

610
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Yes, it's true.

611
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Zhan Mei has nothing to do with me.

612
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
Please look.

613
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
What are you doing?

614
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
What do you want?

615
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
Are you still not willing to admit

616
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
your relationship with Zhan Mei?

617
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
Why would we?

618
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Isn't it a good thing to admit your biological mother?

619
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Yes.

620
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Zhan Mei is my biological mother.

621
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
She doesn't admit it?

622
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Yes.

623
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
It's true.

624
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
But she left home a long time ago.

625
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
I was raised by my grandmother.

626
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
I have long cut off contact with her.

627
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Jian Xi,

628
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
I really sympathize with your experience.

629
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,160
I understand that you are not willing to admit Zhan Mei's feelings.

630
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
But,

631
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,160
there is someone who needs your help.

632
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Director Zuo Gang, please.

633
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Director Zuo Gang?

634
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Director Zuo Gang?

635
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Director Zuo Gang?

636
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
He is really Director Zuo Gang.

637
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Where is he?

638
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
He is not here.

639
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
What is he doing here?

640
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Zuo Dao, please come in.

641
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Thank you.

642
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
I hope you don't misunderstand

643
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
the original intention of our show.

644
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Our purpose is not to make you feel uncomfortable.

645
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Our purpose is not to reveal the past scars of Jian Xi.

646
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,160
But because the son of director Zuo Gang, Zuo Nian, is ill.

647
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,160
He needs a suitable blood-making liver cell.

648
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
And his family can't match.

649
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,160
The only hope is on Jian Xi.

650
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
This is the original intention of our show.

651
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
To save a child's life.

652
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
I know.

653
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
I am not qualified to ask you

654
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
to do anything for me.

655
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
But Jian Xi,

656
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Jian Xi,

657
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Zuo Nian is in danger now.

658
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
As a father,

659
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
I have no other choice.

660
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
You are our only hope.

661
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,160
I hope you can put aside the unpleasant things in the past.

662
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Save Zuo Nian.

663
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
The child is innocent.

664
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Jian Xi, I beg you.

665
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Jian Xi, why are you like this?

666
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
You have blood relations.

667
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
You are the same mother's younger brother.

668
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,160
In my heart, only grandma is my family.

669
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,160
That mother is a stranger to me.

670
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I know Zhan Mei very well.

671
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Actually, she has always been very guilty to you.

672
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
She just doesn't know how to express it.

673
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,160
No matter what reason she abandoned me before,

674
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
since she chose to cheat,

675
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,160
I can't forgive her for the rest of my life.

676
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
I beg you, Jian Xi.

677
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
Is this the bomb you said?

678
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,160
These are just the beginning.

679
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
What do you want?

680
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Sit down.

681
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Look.

682
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,160
The online click rate has risen to the first.

683
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
I am helping Zuo Nian to find Pei Xing.

684
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
How can you do this?

685
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
I want to save Xiao Nian.

686
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Xiao Nian is also my son.

687
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
I love him more than you do.

688
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
But Jian Xi has nothing to do with this.

689
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Why do you drag him in?

690
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
I have no other way.

691
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
This is the only way to save Xiao Nian.

692
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Even if Jian Xi agrees to go to Pei Xing,

693
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
I don't know if it's okay.

694
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,160
Isn't it better to get the public attention together?

695
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
But you made it a stormy city.

696
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Have you ever thought about Jian Xi's situation?

697
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
He will also be hurt.

698
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,160
You used to be a irresponsible mother to him.

699
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Why did you suddenly have such a strong sense of responsibility?

700
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Yes.

701
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,160
I am just an irresponsible mother to Jian Xi.

702
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,160
I also thought we could reconcile through this movie.

703
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
But when I saw his performance,

704
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,160
I knew how much I hurt him before.

705
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,160
I have no right to ask for his forgiveness.

706
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I tell you, Zhan Mei.

707
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
As long as I can save Xiao Nian,

708
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I can do anything.

709
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Even if it hurts Jian Xi,

710
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
I have no choice.

711
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Jian Xi is my daughter.

712
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
I know her better than anyone.

713
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
You did this,

714
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,160
it's just destroying my last hope.

715
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
I will go.

716
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Jian Xi,

717
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
my father is a big director.

718
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,160
I have always been self-centered since I was a child.

719
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
I never cared about Xiao Nian.

720
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Until he got sick this time,

721
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
I started to realize

722
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
how important he was to me.

723
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
I... I am willing.

724
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
If I can,

725
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
I am willing to be a donor.

726
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,160
But the doctor said I can't.

727
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,160
My father didn't want to use public opinion to pressure you.

728
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,160
He just wanted to save Xiao Nian.

729
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,160
I know he is very shameless.

730
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
But you can't...

731
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Your shoes are so beautiful.

732
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,160
You have been wearing beautiful shoes since you were a child.

733
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
I remember when I was a child,

734
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,160
I could only wear old shoes.

735
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Once I was in the broadcast studio,

736
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,160
my shoes fell off.

737
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,160
All the kids were laughing at me.

738
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
Jian Xi.

739
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
I am used to it.

740
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,160
All the way,

741
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,160
many people helped me.

742
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,160
They had nothing to do with me.

743
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,160
But they kept giving me chances.

744
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
I was thinking,

745
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
those who had nothing to do with me

746
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,160
kept giving me warmth.

747
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,160
And my biological mother,

748
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,160
she gave me only hurt and torture.

749
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Nothing else was left.

750
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
You know,

751
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,160
when I saw that scene in the hospital,

752
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,160
I realized how despicable my biological mother was.

753
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Jian Xi.

754
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
From then on,

755
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,160
Zhan Mei is not in my heart.

756
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Not even a stranger is as good as her.

757
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
I will think about the formula.

758
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Miss Zuo.

759
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
I am tired.

760
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
You should go back.

761
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Jian Xi.

762
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Miss Zuo.

763
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Please don't bother Jian Xi.

764
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
I just want...

765
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Get out.

766
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I beg you.

767
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,160
Just do the heart-wrenching.

768
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Give us some hope, okay?

769
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Get out.

770
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Please get out.

771
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
Jian Xi.

772
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Miss Zuo.

773
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
I brought you some medicine.

774
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Don't worry.

775
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,160
I will always be by your side to protect you.

776
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
Miss Zuo.

777
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
I am very confused now.

778
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,160
Why would this happen?

779
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Don't think too much.

780
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,160
You should calm down first.

781
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Miss Zuo.

782
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Miss Zuo.

783
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
You should calm down first.

784
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Jian Xi.

785
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Listen to me.

786
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,160
If Zhan Mei can admit to you very early,

787
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Zuo Nian and you have brotherhood.

788
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I believe you will take the initiative today.

789
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
But they didn't.

790
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
So all of this

791
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
was caused by Zuo Nian's parents.

792
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,160
Zuo Nian shouldn't suffer their suffering.

793
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Think about it.

794
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Zuo Nian is innocent.

795
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
We can't make everyone satisfied

796
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
by doing anything.

797
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,160
You have the right to make your own choice.

798
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
No one is qualified

799
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,160
to force you to do what you don't want to do.

800
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,160
I really don't know what to do.

801
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,160
So I will help you make the decision.

802
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
The most correct decision.

803
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
I have a teacher.

804
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Don't worry.

805
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Sir, talk about your opinion on Jian Xi.

806
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
I think Jian Xi is a kind girl.

807
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,160
She will definitely save her brother.

808
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,160
I think as a public figure,

809
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,160
she should be a model for the public.

810
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
She should be an example.

811
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
To cheer up the people's concern about saving the family.

812
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Not to mention,

813
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
she is a blood relative.

814
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,160
The editor Li Yin Si is too innocent.

815
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,160
It's shameless to make the editor Li Yin Si.

816
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
I am saving people.

817
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
It's not appropriate to make the public

818
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
care about Zuo Nian's condition.

819
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
If she agrees to be a model,

820
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
you will not waste your time.

821
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Of course not.

822
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Why are you so sure?

823
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Do you understand the rules?

824
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
This is my office.

825
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
Tang Fei.

826
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
Tang Fei, what are you doing?

827
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
About Jian Xi, I...

828
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Let go.

829
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Do you know why I hit you?

830
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Be careful.

831
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Tang Fei.

832
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Tang Fei.

833
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Tang Fei.

834
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
Tang Fei, wait.

835
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Tang Fei, don't misunderstand Tang Fei.

836
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
I actually...

837
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Ji Xiang.

838
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
I don't understand why you

839
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
have become a model.

840
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
I don't understand why you

841
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
have become like this.

842
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Why?

843
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Because I love you.

844
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
I don't want to give you to him.

845
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Have we ever been together?

846
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,160
What do you love me for?

847
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,160
I... Of course I...

848
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160
What kind of person am I?

849
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
You still don't know?

850
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,160
I know.

851
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
I know everything.

852
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Tang Fei, I love you.

853
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Because you are righteous,

854
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
kind,

855
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
and very gentle.

856
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Qing Si.

857
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Am I like this?

858
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Tell him.

859
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Let me tell you.

860
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
From the first day I entered the industry,

861
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
I took a mask

862
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
to face you guys.

863
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,160
I'm tired of being a hooker.

864
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Do you know why I like Jian Xi?

865
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Because when I'm with her,

866
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I can be myself.

867
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
Even so,

868
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
I still love you.

869
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Then I'll be honest with you.

870
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
I love you.

871
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
I love you too.

872
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Then I'll be honest with you.

873
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I don't love you.

874
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
I've never loved you.

875
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,160
Even so,

876
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,160
I want to do my best.

877
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
I just can't.

878
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Yes.

879
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Because you can't.

880
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
This is your reason.

881
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
You can let Qi Wen Sen

882
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
do the thing that hurt Jian Xi.

883
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Now, you and the previous team,

884
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Shen Yan,

885
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
what's the difference?

886
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Tang Fei.

887
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,160
How can you compare me to them?

888
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
Of course you're different from them.

889
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,160
You're born better than them.

890
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
You don't have to do everything yourself.

891
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Someone will help you.

892
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
In this respect,

893
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
you're much happier than them.

894
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
I'm sorry.

895
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
It's all my fault.

896
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
Are you satisfied with

897
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
what Tang Fei did to me?

898
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Take a good look at this place.

899
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
I don't think you'll have a chance

900
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,160
to come here again.

901
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Take a good look at this place.

902
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
I don't think you'll have a chance

903
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
to come here again.

904
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,160
I just want to leave without your help.

905
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
And someone,

906
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
who they think they're confident.

907
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
Will show their skills?

908
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
Mr Bu,

909
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
He is called Jian Xi.

910
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,160
He is the little girl who gives milk.

911
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Your performance is not good enough.

912
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,160
But there is one thing that you have done wrong.

913
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
You just tell me the truth.

914
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,160
What method did you use

915
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,160
to make Lu Zhou help you get into school?

916
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
I gave milk. I never performed.

917
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,160
But I don't use despicable means like you said.

918
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Who would believe you?

919
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
I believe you.

920
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
You!

921
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,160
Why did he do that to you?

922
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,160
None of us did.

923
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,160
You girls must be careful.

924
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
How dare you use a knife?

925
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
You are deliberately hurting him.

926
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Yes, I did.

927
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
What else could it be?

928
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
Are you crazy?

929
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
I didn't do anything.

930
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
I am telling you.

931
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
When you were performing,

932
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,160
no matter how people humiliated you,

933
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
You can't stop.

934
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
You must always remember

935
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
that you are an actor.

936
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,160
The company is not a charity provider.

937
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
You will never take in useless people.

938
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,160
The glory under the spotlight

939
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
is at the cost of suffering.

940
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
If you want to rest,

941
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
choose to give up.

942
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Only by giving up can you rest forever.

943
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,160
I don't want to leave.

944
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,160
So I can hold on until the end.

945
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
Jianshi,

946
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
when you walk on the red carpet,

947
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
you must make the audience feel

948
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,160
that you are the most brilliant.

949
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Jianshi,

950
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
take back everything that belongs to you.

951
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
It's your turn.

952
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Fighting.

953
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,160
Train the Emperor

954
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:26,440
Naturally activate the

955
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:33,440
The clouds are falling on the flowers

956
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,440
The moonlight shines on me tonight

957
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,440
I sing with my loneliness

958
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,440
I watch the flowers wither and the sun rises

959
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,440
I watch loneliness turn into frost

960
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
I watch the tide rise and fall

961
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,440
The cold and cold weather is cold and the sky is dark and the sky is bright

962
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,440
Too much hope, in the end, I become desperate

963
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,440
I watch you come and go, holding on to the wind and frost

964
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Everything is in a state of panic

965
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:16,440
Too stubborn, I have to be young and panic

966
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,440
There is a lie that I don't forget the fire

967
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:35,660
Looking back, all the grudges will have a

968
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,660
I and you are gradually lost on the road

969
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,660
The sea is crazy, don't think about anything

970
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:47,660
Where is the new yellow sea?

971
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,880
Just like this, waiting for a person to dawn

972
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,880
Just like this, waiting for a person to dawn

973
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:05,880
Just like this, waiting for a person to dawn
