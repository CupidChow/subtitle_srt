1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Miss you

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Love you

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far or far away

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
At that moment

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
A long age

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,240
Turned into a magical eye

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,920
Pass through the loneliness to find you

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,040
Put on the most solid gold armor

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,920
Hold the weapon in your hand

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Use all your strength to fight for the most real self

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the little tricks

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what rumors

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,120
I will definitely be invincible

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't want you to be willing

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Where is the gold?

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,440
In the past, I kept this sweet

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,760
No matter where your heart is

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,080
My heart is here

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
Even if the world is invincible

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Only for you

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,760
The End

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,960
The End

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,640
You didn't believe me from the beginning to the end

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,920
I treat you as my best friend

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,680
You are the same as others

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,600
You were deceived by his weak appearance

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,400
I know he forced you to go

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
I was in your heart

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,560
Is also that kind of greedy and vain

38
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,640
You are a woman who does not do anything, right?

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
I

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,840
Ke Lu

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Shen Ying

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,720
I am dizzy

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
Can you take me to the hospital?

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,360
it is good

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
Jin Xin

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's talk another day

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,640
go

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,880
If you believe him today

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,040
From now on, we are no longer friends

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,800
Jin Xin, you are mature, OK?

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
In my heart

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,960
Real friends

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,920
Should trust each other

54
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Should not be deceived by this appearance

55
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,080
I also finally

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,880
Tell you again

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,200
I did nothing to him

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,080
His face is not related to me

59
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,440
Ke Lu

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,640
I'll take you to the hospital first

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,440
Give up

62
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,320
What does it look like?

63
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,360
Most angry

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,920
Miss

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,040
I was confused

66
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,680
The amount of cells here

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,560
Are opened

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,120
Miss

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
Citizenship

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,280
Go

71
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
A long long time ago

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
I remember

73
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,000
She was feeling bad

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,580
Who is he?

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Who is he?

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,720
Who is he?

77
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,900
Who is he?

78
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
Let's discuss about the MV sequel together.

79
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,500
I, the agent,

80
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,420
and the director of the MV,

81
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,260
are all here.

82
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,340
We can help her with the evidence.

83
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,700
Discuss about the MV sequel?

84
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,820
Are you going to continue to cooperate?

85
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,220
There are a lot of negative news about her.

86
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,780
Aren't you afraid of being affected?

87
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,140
It's not the first time

88
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,380
that I have cooperated with Jansy.

89
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,500
In my impression,

90
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,100
I think she is a very professional

91
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,740
and professional actress.

92
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,900
So I believe that those rumors

93
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,540
are all false.

94
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,420
Since it's a rumor,

95
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,100
I hope that everyone

96
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,500
doesn't believe it.

97
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,260
I believe that

98
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,140
an actress who sees acting as

99
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,300
more important than her life

100
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,260
will never be confused

101
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,780
and destroy herself.

102
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,340
At the same time,

103
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,260
as her good friend,

104
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,380
I think I have the obligation

105
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,740
to help her clarify this matter.

106
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,300
I also hope that many media friends

107
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,500
can give her a relatively relaxed environment.

108
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,540
You are great.

109
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,620
I've defaulted on picking on you,

110
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,420
you have to confess,

111
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,700
you have to explain everything carefully.

112
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
If you confess here.

113
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,460
It's not easy.

114
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,600
This day,

115
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,380
i've exhausted you.

116
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,360
Your face is beautiful.

117
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,900
Let's leave this room

118
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,620
and try to figure out a way

119
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,740
to find Jansy's criminal background.

120
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,380
Okay.

121
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,280
I know you.

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,580
How can we go home?

123
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,060
Huh?

124
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,740
You still don't forgive her?

125
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,260
I must kill her first.

126
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm not saying anything.

127
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
Do you really believe me?

128
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,260
I don't believe you.

129
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
I...

130
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
I believe in my own taste.

131
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
I think with your intelligence,

132
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,260
you can't even buy a chest.

133
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,260
What's wrong with my intelligence?

134
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,260
Then why are you helping me?

135
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,260
You are the heroine of this series of MVs I chose.

136
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
If you change your character, it will affect me.

137
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,260
It will drag on to my image, do you understand?

138
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
Instead of asking Du Wenxi here,

139
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
you should think about

140
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260
how to turn around.

141
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
I have a chance to turn around.

142
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
Jingjing!

143
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,260
Jingjing, are you okay?

144
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,260
We are about to shoot the MV.

145
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
I have to show my best condition.

146
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
Ji Qing,

147
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,260
your foot injury hasn't healed yet.

148
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,260
You are still practicing day and night.

149
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
You are working too hard.

150
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
I'm fine.

151
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,260
Don't worry.

152
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Look, I'm fine now.

153
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
I can't do anything about you.

154
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,260
You have to be careful.

155
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,260
Don't get hurt again.

156
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
By the way,

157
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
I have to go to the hospital.

158
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
By the way, how is Jianxi?

159
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,260
She is completely down now.

160
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,260
No one is looking for her to shoot the MV.

161
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
It's all over.

162
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,260
People like her

163
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
are not worthy of being your opponent.

164
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,260
As the saying goes,

165
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,260
the wood is like a fish in the forest,

166
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
the wind is like a paper.

167
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,260
The faster she climbs,

168
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,260
the worse she falls.

169
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
No one can save her.

170
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,260
Am I really overlooking her?

171
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,260
Okay, look down.

172
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Okay, be more sexy.

173
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,260
Okay.

174
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Okay.

175
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,260
Okay.

176
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,260
Okay, thank you.

177
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
Thank you.

178
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,260
Look,

179
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,260
her eye beads are almost falling out.

180
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,260
I'm fine.

181
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,260
I'm fine.

182
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,260
I'm fine.

183
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
I'm fine.

184
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm fine.

185
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
Your phone.

186
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,260
Here.

187
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Sorry, the number you dialed is not available for the moment.

188
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,260
Please redial later.

189
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Sorry.

190
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
The doctor said you have some blood pressure.

191
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,260
Take more rest when you go back.

192
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,260
Thank you for coming to the hospital with me today.

193
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
But,

194
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
you and Jianxi...

195
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
I will explain to her later.

196
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Go.

197
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
Okay.

198
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
Okay.

199
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Okay.

200
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
Okay.

201
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,260
Okay.

202
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
Okay.

203
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Okay.

204
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
Actually, I want to thank you.

205
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,260
Thank you for not following me.

206
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
In the end,

207
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Jianxi is also my friend.

208
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Shen Yan,

209
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
you are so kind.

210
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
So,

211
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
from today on,

212
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
I'm also your friend?

213
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,260
Aren't you afraid that Jianxi will be angry?

214
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
I'm just kidding.

215
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
Okay,

216
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,260
I'll go back by taxi later.

217
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
You go explain to her quickly.

218
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
I should send you back first.

219
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
What's wrong?

220
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
I just envy Jianxi.

221
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,260
Envy?

222
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
You like her so much.

223
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,260
But she doesn't take you seriously.

224
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
She just treats you as a friend.

225
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,260
If it were me, I...

226
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,260
Sorry.

227
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
Sorry.

228
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,260
I didn't mean to say that.

229
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,260
I didn't mean anything else.

230
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
I'll send you back first.

231
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,260
Stop the car.

232
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
Stop the car.

233
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
Zuo Zuo.

234
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
Zuo Zuo, what are you doing?

235
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
It's dangerous.

236
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
What are you doing?

237
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
There must be a hole if one lies.

238
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
As long as I find this hole,

239
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
I can turn around.

240
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
You're all looking for it.

241
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,260
You can't find it even if you look down.

242
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,260
What should we do then?

243
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,260
I know.

244
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,260
It's hard to compare with computers.

245
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
So I bought all these newspapers.

246
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
Then we can look at them one by one.

247
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,260
And compare them together.

248
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,260
If you lie too much,

249
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
you will definitely have a hole.

250
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:21,840
The

251
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
Still not working.

252
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,260
You can't find it?

253
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,260
Let me help you.

254
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,260
I didn't find any useful information.

255
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Listen to me.

256
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,260
I don't know what you're looking at.

257
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,260
What?

258
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
Of course you should focus on what you're looking at.

259
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Listen.

260
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
Listen.

261
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
According to this report,

262
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
Shen Yan was beaten up by someone

263
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,260
after he came out of the hotel after the murder.

264
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Then he was treated in the An Tai Hospital.

265
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Then the reporter came over.

266
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,260
He was so famous.

267
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
An Tai?

268
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,260
Right.

269
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,260
We can find out his medical record and medical record

270
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,260
and find out if he was really injured.

271
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,260
Of course not.

272
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,260
In the case that you didn't provide any ID card,

273
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,260
no hospital will provide you with a private patient.

274
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,260
This is against the hospital's rules.

275
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,260
What should we do?

276
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Nothing. There must be another way.

277
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Let's take our time.

278
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Let's look for it again.

279
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Thank you for helping me all the time.

280
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,260
It's so late today.

281
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
You should rest early.

282
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,260
I'll go back and think of something.

283
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,260
I'll go back and think of something.

284
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Yule.

285
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Tell me.

286
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Find the reporter who went to the An Tai Hospital

287
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,260
and interviewed the reporters of these cases.

288
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,260
Ask him for the first-hand information.

289
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,260
Use your method.

290
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
It's better to use your method.

291
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,260
Okay.

292
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
I know.

293
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
This woman must have a problem.

294
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,260
I've told you many times.

295
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
Don't come to me again.

296
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
Your mother is very sick now.

297
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
She misses you all the time.

298
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
She wants to see you.

299
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,260
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
I miss you all the time.

307
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,260
I just want to meet you.

308
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,260
I'm busy so I have no time for shooting every night.

309
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,260
But you and your mother

310
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,260
haven't seen each other for half a year.

311
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
You can't take the time

312
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
to go back and see them.

313
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
Go back?

314
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Go back to where?

315
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
To that private library?

316
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,260
Xiao Yan.

317
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
It's my father's fault.

318
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,260
But your mother

319
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
I'm not your father.

320
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,020
You can't live a happy life

321
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,740
because of me.

322
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,580
You don't even care about your mother.

323
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,180
Tell mom

324
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,060
I'll go back to see her when I'm free.

325
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,460
Take these first.

326
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,620
You can use them to treat your illness

327
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,860
or buy some tonics.

328
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,180
Xiao Yan.

329
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,980
Enough.

330
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,180
Don't come to me

331
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,260
whenever you want.

332
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,340
It'll be troublesome

333
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,260
if others see you.

334
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,340
You're...

335
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,380
Tang Lang is helping Huang Que.

336
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,300
He helped me kill the enemy.

337
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,620
It's time to send him off.

338
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,820
By the way,

339
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,500
keep an eye on this man for me.

340
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,780
I want the most detailed information about him.

341
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,060
Hurry up.

342
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:17,980
Hurry up.

343
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,380
Deputy Director, you're looking for me?

344
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,220
You're here.

345
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,220
I'm waiting for you.

346
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,580
Why are you waiting for me?

347
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,260
The company is new.

348
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,220
The people are good.

349
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,060
Less roles.

350
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,700
Less people.

351
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,380
Less roles.

352
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,140
You can't find a substitute for me.

353
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,540
You don't have a play, do you?

354
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,660
I have a role.

355
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,180
Why do I have to call you?

356
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,060
I'm full.

357
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,260
Hurry up and put on makeup.

358
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,100
What's wrong?

359
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,580
You don't want to play Longtao?

360
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,220
No.

361
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,420
I'm too happy.

362
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,860
Go on. Put on makeup.

363
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,620
Thank you, Deputy Director.

364
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,540
Thank you, Deputy Director.

365
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,420
I told you.

366
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,980
Do you understand?

367
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,620
Deputy Director.

368
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,740
I've changed.

369
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,860
You've changed?

370
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,220
Let me tell you.

371
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,660
You play a dancer in this play.

372
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,260
Your child is sick.

373
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,380
You're in a hurry to go home.

374
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,500
The drinker forces you to drink.

375
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,580
You don't agree.

376
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,540
You'll get beaten up.

377
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,780
Beaten up?

378
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,740
Yes.

379
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,500
To pursue authenticity,

380
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,660
it's all true.

381
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,540
Can you do it?

382
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,540
Yes.

383
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,500
Okay.

384
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,140
Start.

385
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,140
The lines.

386
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,020
Where are the lines?

387
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,660
It's such a simple plot.

388
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,820
You want lines from me?

389
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:18,980
Play it yourself.

390
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,020
Thank you, Director.

391
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,780
Thank you, Deputy Director.

392
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,500
Three scenes, one scene, one time.

393
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,780
Action.

394
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,700
Come on.

395
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,900
I'm sorry.

396
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,660
My child has a high fever.

397
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,060
I have to go back now.

398
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,900
Drink this and leave.

399
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,540
I'm sorry.

400
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,500
I can't drink.

401
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,660
My child has a high fever.

402
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,180
I really have to go back now.

403
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,380
You just want money.

404
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,180
Take it.

405
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,260
I'm sorry.

406
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,780
I have to go now.

407
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,580
I spend money to find happiness.

408
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,180
How dare you go out without me?

409
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,180
Drink.

410
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220
Miss Shen, you're here.

411
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,500
Why is Jianxi here?

412
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,060
This girl

413
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,980
has done a lot of dirty things.

414
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,300
Everyone has seen her for a long time.

415
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,660
Right?

416
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,580
I heard that

417
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,340
she called everywhere to find a play.

418
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,140
Look.

419
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,660
I gave her a role.

420
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,500
She's playing it.

421
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,620
That's not good.

422
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,860
What's wrong with it?

423
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,140
She came to film.

424
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,420
We didn't force her.

425
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,180
Anyway, thank you.

426
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,300
Don't thank me.

427
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:24,980
I'm really sorry.

428
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,780
I'm just being nice.

429
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,340
Listen.

430
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:26,980
After this,

431
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,460
If you don't drink,

432
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,140
I'll tell you to drink.

433
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,140
I'll see if she dares to be so arrogant.

434
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,820
Don't jump.

435
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,740
Drink.

436
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,220
Mr. Zang.

437
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,380
Mr. Zang.

438
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,820
I told you.

439
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,940
My child has a fever.

440
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,060
I really have to go back now.

441
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,580
I'm begging you.

442
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,100
This girl is good at acting.

443
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,860
I don't drink.

444
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,780
Her tears are real.

445
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,060
You're still here?

446
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,540
Hello, Mr. Liu.

447
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,980
Miss Shen is here.

448
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,540
Miss Shen.

449
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,420
Sit.

450
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,220
Thank you.

451
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,380
I've seen a lot of people like you.

452
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,540
You're teasing me, aren't you?

453
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,060
Sir.

454
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,540
Director.

455
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,540
If it's a girl who is pregnant,

456
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,940
It's better to cry.

457
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,620
It's hard to make the audience moved

458
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,260
with tears in their eyes.

459
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,100
You can try it.

460
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,420
Cut.

461
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,580
You have to act out.

462
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,500
Cry out.

463
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,740
Cry out loudly.

464
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:30,900
Director.

465
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,740
I want to show

466
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,420
the patience of this dancer.

467
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
This will reflect

468
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,500
some unfortunate life and situation.

469
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,100
If your performance is in place,

470
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,540
will it waste the director's time?

471
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,220
Why are you talking so much?

472
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,460
Are you going to act or not?

473
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,700
Okay, I'll try.

474
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,060
Zang Ran.

475
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,620
Sir.

476
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,180
Look.

477
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,100
My child is having a fever.

478
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,580
I really want to go back.

479
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,700
You don't want to go to the shooting today.

480
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,020
Director, you're right.

481
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,940
Only by crying in the eyes

482
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,060
can you show the strength of a dancer.

483
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,620
Happy.

484
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,540
Not only can I make you cry,

485
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,260
I can also give you money.

486
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:13,820
Cut.

487
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,900
Keep the performance.

488
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,420
Cry out.

489
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,100
Don't fall.

490
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,220
But...

491
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,260
But you just said...

492
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,300
Whatever the director says, you do it.

493
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,820
You're more professional than any other actor.

494
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,780
The movie school is lined up.

495
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,540
Are you going to act or not?

496
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,820
I'm sorry.

497
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,740
I'll try again.

498
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,060
Come on, everyone, get ready.

499
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,660
One more time.

500
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,740
Action.

501
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,900
You won't make me happy today.

502
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,780
I won't let you go back.

503
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,540
But as long as you drink with me,

504
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,820
I'll be happy.

505
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,380
Not only can I make you cry,

506
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,940
I can also give you money.

507
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,820
Cut. Okay.

508
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,540
Ready for the next one.

509
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:08,980
Okay.

510
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,060
Are you okay?

511
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,060
I'm fine.

512
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,740
Jian Xi.

513
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,420
Are you okay?

514
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,500
I'm fine.

515
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,260
I've told you.

516
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,580
I can give you more opportunities.

517
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,100
Why do you have to suffer?

518
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,100
Why do you come here to play the dragon?

519
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,340
The movie star is mixed up like this.

520
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,260
If people know it,

521
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,700
how can you go out to see people?

522
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,300
I rely on my own ability to eat.

523
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,540
What can't I see?

524
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,700
It's better than those who think about how to trick others.

525
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,860
I hope you don't regret your arrogance.

526
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,780
Director.

527
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,060
Are we going to change the scene after this scene?

528
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,100
Jian Xi.

529
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,220
Come here.

530
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,460
I'll add another scene for you.

531
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,580
Director Liu, this is not appropriate.

532
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,540
He only has one scene.

533
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,740
Who says so?

534
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,020
Of course you say so.

535
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,500
That's good.

536
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,900
It's a temporary scene.

537
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,060
Director.

538
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,860
This scene really can't be added.

539
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,220
The next scene is the scene of the fire in the dance hall.

540
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,060
Yes.

541
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,340
Add a scene for him here.

542
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,660
I need to see a girl

543
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,260
rushing out of the fire.

544
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,140
Jian Xi, can you do it?

545
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,620
I can.

546
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,540
Don't worry.

547
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,300
I won't really burn you.

548
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,420
We will do all the precautions.

549
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,260
Just for a while.

550
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,980
Thank you, director.

551
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,260
All of you, get ready.

552
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:38,780
Thank you.

553
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,460
Get ready.

554
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,220
Ready.

555
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,260
Action.

556
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,820
Nowٍ

557
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:19,980
Jian Xi.

558
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
Are you okay?

559
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,780
Are you okay?

560
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
I'm fine.

561
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
I'm fine.

562
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,780
Slowly.

563
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
You're really good at acting.

564
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,780
Just let me wipe it.

565
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,780
Okay.

566
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,780
Director, how was my acting?

567
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,780
Do you want me to do it again?

568
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,780
No need.

569
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
It's good.

570
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,780
Thank you.

571
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,780
Go with her to get the money.

572
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
Thank you, director.

573
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,780
Thank you, director.

574
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,780
Tianxi, come with me.

575
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,780
The whole scene of the scene of Jiansi's rush out of the fire,

576
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,780
the whole scene feels different.

577
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,780
Do you understand?

578
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,780
But director,

579
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,780
it's not good for you to add more scenes to her.

580
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,780
She can't beat Shen Yan.

581
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,780
Her character is not good.

582
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,780
The character is good,

583
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,780
but the scenes are too bad.

584
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
What's the use of it?

585
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,780
What's the use of it?

586
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,780
What does an actor do?

587
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,780
Acting is the first priority.

588
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,780
If Qi Wensan is not allowed to use her,

589
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
I really want to give her a female lead.

590
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,780
Here.

591
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,780
Thank you.

592
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,780
Here, take it.

593
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Thank you.

594
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,780
Can I have a meal?

595
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,780
Sure.

596
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Of course.

597
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,780
Thank you.

598
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,780
Thank you.

599
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,780
What are you doing?

600
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,780
I'm sorry.

601
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
I broke your meal.

602
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,780
How much is it?

603
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,780
I'll pay you.

604
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,780
You're too much.

605
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,780
Miss Shen.

606
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,780
Miss Shen.

607
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,780
You're so arrogant as an actor.

608
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,780
Aren't you afraid that others will see your true face?

609
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,780
Brother Fei,

610
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
you misunderstood.

611
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,780
I accidentally broke his meal.

612
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,780
I'm sorry, Jianxi.

613
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
You're so good at acting.

614
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,780
Keep acting.

615
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,780
Is your right hand better?

616
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
My hand is almost healed.

617
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,780
Tang Fei.

618
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,780
You told others that

619
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,780
you were attacked.

620
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,780
Normally, you should use your right hand.

621
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,780
In theory,

622
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,780
your left face should be hurt.

623
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,780
Then why did you tell the reporter

624
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,780
that your right eye was hurt?

625
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Did this person hit your left face

626
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,780
and hurt your right eye?

627
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,780
You're lying.

628
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,780
You're not hurt at all.

629
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,780
Of course,

630
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,780
he can also tell us that

631
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,780
the person who attacked him is left-handed.

632
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
But there's more.

633
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,780
The medical certificate in the reporter's hand

634
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,780
was copied by you.

635
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,780
The number of the medical certificate is

636
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,780
0001234 and 0001235.

637
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,780
At that time,

638
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,780
you also hung the bone and eye.

639
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,780
Then why are the two different bones

640
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,780
in the same order?

641
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,780
At that time, it was 8.30 p.m.

642
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,780
and there was only one patient in the hospital.

643
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
The hospital made a fake?

644
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,780
Of course, the hospital made a fake.

645
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,780
The fake one is this Miss Shi.

646
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Is it easy to make a fish-like thing?

647
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,780
Just bump into it on the wall,

648
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,780
there will be a fish-like thing.

649
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,780
So she hung a bone

650
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,780
and opened a real diagnosis book.

651
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780
Then based on that real diagnosis book,

652
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,780
a fake certificate that really

653
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
diagnosed as a fake

654
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,780
that can be used to prove the damage of a drug.

655
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,780
Do you want us to

656
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,780
show you the video of the eye surgery?

657
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,780
Jianxi, I'm sorry.

658
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,780
It's all my fault.

659
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,780
I said I had a reason.

660
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
I had to do this.

661
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
I beg you not to tell anyone,

662
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,780
okay?

663
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,780
I tell anyone?

664
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Then who will help me

665
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,780
clear my name?

666
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,780
I apologize to you.

667
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,780
I'm sorry to you, okay?

668
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
You can ask me to do anything.

669
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,780
Just give me a chance.

670
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Did you give her a chance when you hurt her?

671
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,780
People who betray their friends are not worth forgiving.

672
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,780
Jianxi, no.

673
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
If you do this,

674
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,780
I will lose my job.

675
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,780
No one will look for me anymore.

676
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
I have to support my family.

677
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
My mom is sick now.

678
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,780
I have to take the medical expenses.

679
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,780
I'm ruined.

680
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
My whole family is ruined.

681
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Jianxi, I know you have a good heart.

682
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,780
You won't die.

683
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
You won't die, right?

684
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,780
We are best friends.

685
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
I'm better than you in acting.

686
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,780
Brother Fei, I have no grudge against you.

687
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
Why do you force me?

688
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
I force you?

689
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
Yes.

690
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
Even if I did something wrong,

691
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,780
why don't you give me a chance?

692
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,780
You didn't figure out something.

693
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,780
This fool,

694
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
I'm the only one in the world who can bully.

695
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Others can't bully.

696
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,780
You rushed here for no reason.

697
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,780
Of course I have to target you.

698
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
What are you talking about?

699
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,780
Who is willing to bully you?

700
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,780
He doesn't want to apologize to you.

701
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,780
He is afraid of being exposed.

702
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,780
He is not afraid of losing a friend like you.

703
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,780
Here, I give you an hour.

704
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
We will have a press conference to clarify it.

705
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
Press conference?

706
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,780
Clarify it?

707
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
Then I'm done.

708
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
Jianxi, I beg you.

709
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,780
You said it yourself.

710
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Or let us expose you.

711
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,780
You choose.

712
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,780
Do it yourself.

713
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,780
Mr. Tang, I just got the money.

714
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,780
I'll treat you to a meal.

715
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,780
Good idea.

716
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
Let's go.

717
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
What do you want to eat?

718
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,780
Please buy me steak.

719
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
I can't afford it.

720
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
I'm so hungry.

721
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,780
Shen Yan, you don't look well.

722
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
What happened?

723
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
Drink some water.

724
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
I'll go and make up for other actors.

725
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
Thank you.

726
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
Miss Shen, someone is looking for you.

727
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Thank you.

728
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
I'll go out first.

729
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,780
Thank you.

730
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,780
You're welcome.

731
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780
I told you not to come to me.

732
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,780
Xiao Yan, they all know.

733
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,780
You'd better leave here.

734
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,780
Know what?

735
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,780
It's my fault.

736
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,780
What happened?

737
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,780
A lot of reporters came to our house.

738
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
They took a lot of pictures.

739
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
They even asked about the play.

740
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,780
They all said it was a play.

741
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,780
They took a lot of pictures.

742
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,780
They even asked about the play.

743
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,780
Take pictures?

744
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
Ask about the play?

745
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Yes.

746
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,780
Xiao Yan, while the reporters are not here yet,

747
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
let's get out of here.

748
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
I won't leave.

749
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
I will never leave.

750
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,780
What are those pictures?

751
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Not only that,

752
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,780
they also have the video of us meeting in the cafe that day.

753
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,780
They also said that you are famous now.

754
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,780
You don't recognize your parents.

755
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,780
I tried my best to explain to them.

756
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
But they didn't believe me.

757
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,780
I suffered so much.

758
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,780
I finally got here.

759
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,780
I'm famous.

760
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,780
I'm famous.

761
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,780
I have a bright future.

762
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,780
Why should I leave?

763
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,780
I won't leave.

764
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,780
I'll give you an hour.

765
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
The press conference will be held in a few minutes.

766
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,780
You decide.

767
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780
Or should we expose you?

768
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
You decide.

769
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,780
No.

770
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,780
I can't.

771
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,780
I can't fail.

772
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,780
I can't fail.

773
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,780
Xiao Yan,

774
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,780
the problem is what you can do now.

775
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Miss Shen Ye.

776
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,780
Miss Shen Ye.

777
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Please come in.

778
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
Miss Shen, I heard that you became famous.

779
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,780
You never visited your mother in the hospital.

780
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,780
Can you explain to us?

781
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
Bai Shan is a filial son.

782
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
You are a famous actor.

783
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,780
But you neglected your parents.

784
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
How do you face the public?

785
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
Yes.

786
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
You will have a very bad influence on the youth.

787
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Yes.

788
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
You are right.

789
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
Miss Shen, please come back.

790
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,780
Please come back.

791
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
Shen Yan.

792
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
Shen Yan.

793
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,780
What are you doing?

794
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,780
What's going on?

795
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,780
Who are you?

796
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
Listen up.

797
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,780
I'm Shen Yan's father.

798
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,780
I worked hard to educate him.

799
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
I raised him up.

800
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
But look at him.

801
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
He is a movie star now.

802
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
He is a fool.

803
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
He is not...

804
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
What?

805
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
He is not good at raising his parents.

806
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
I came to him.

807
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,780
He drove me away.

808
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,780
Dad.

809
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
What are you doing?

810
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Am I wrong?

811
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,780
Tell me.

812
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
Is he disloyal and unfilial?

813
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,780
He is not good at everything.

814
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Hurry up.

815
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Take a picture of him.

816
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Take a picture of him.

817
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
Have you had enough?

818
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,780
I want the whole world to know that

819
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,780
he is a unfilial daughter.

820
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,780
Don't think about being a movie star.

821
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,780
You should wait for your return

822
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,780
and be your waitress.

823
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,780
Why doesn't Shen Yan recognize you?

824
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,780
It's because you borrowed money from him.

825
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,780
Shen Yan's mom is in the hospital.

826
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,780
Yang Yang, don't say anymore.

827
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,780
He is my father.

828
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,780
Shen Yan, you can't be so kind anymore.

829
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
A person like him

830
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,780
is not qualified to be your father.

831
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,780
I'm going to tell you all your grievances today.

832
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Let everyone give you a reason.

833
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,780
It's him.

834
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,780
He is a man of his word.

835
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
He owes a lot.

836
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,780
He has been out of school since he was a child.

837
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
Do you know that

838
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,780
Shen Yan has to work three shifts a day

839
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,780
to get his mother's blood out?

840
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,780
But Shen Yan has been working hard

841
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,780
to earn money for his sick mother.

842
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,780
He has been filming every day and night.

843
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,780
He has no time to stay with his mother.

844
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
But you?

845
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,780
You don't understand him.

846
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,780
You even asked him for money.

847
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,780
Do you dare to say no?

848
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,780
Dad, can you help me?

849
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,780
Dad.

850
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,780
How can I help you?

851
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,780
I have worked so hard

852
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,780
to get all this.

853
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,780
If I leave,

854
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,780
I will be beaten back to the original form.

855
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,780
I know that I was bad to you.

856
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
It's all my fault.

857
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
It's all my fault, dad.

858
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,780
Now only you can help me.

859
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,780
Dad, I'm your biological daughter.

860
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,780
Please help me.

861
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
What do you want me to do?

862
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
Dad.

863
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
She is my daughter.

864
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
I don't want money from her.

865
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
Who else?

866
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,780
She doesn't support me.

867
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
She is unfilial.

868
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,780
What are you doing?

869
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Dad, you can't do this.

870
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,780
My mother gave me this money.

871
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
You can't take it.

872
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,780
Xiao Yan,

873
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,780
I can't die if I don't help you.

874
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
I can use this money.

875
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
It doesn't matter.

876
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,780
I will return it to her when I have money.

877
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,780
No, dad.

878
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,780
Dad.

879
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Dad.

880
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,780
Shen Yan.

881
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,780
Move aside.

882
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Dad.

883
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
What's going on?

884
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
Did you see it?

885
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,780
Shen Yan suffered a lot.

886
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,780
How can you accept someone like him?

887
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Actually,

888
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
I will go to you

889
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,780
if you don't come today.

890
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
Because today

891
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
I want to ask you a question.

892
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
Actually,

893
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
I was attacked

894
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
because my dad

895
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,780
owed someone money outside.

896
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,780
So those people found me.

897
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,780
Later, he came to me for money.

898
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,780
Then I knew the truth.

899
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,780
Everyone misunderstood Jianshi.

900
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,780
It has nothing to do with him.

901
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,780
How did I do this?

902
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,780
It's all my fault.

903
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,780
I misunderstood him.

904
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,780
Please

905
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,780
marry the truth.

906
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Give Jianshi a clean break.

907
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
I will continue to work hard.

908
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,780
And then I will make better works

909
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,780
for everyone to see.

910
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,780
Thank you

911
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,780
for helping me to clarify in front of everyone.

912
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
You are so kind.

913
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
You must tell me

914
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,780
if you encounter this kind of thing.

915
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,780
How can you be so hard on yourself?

916
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,780
My dad is like this.

917
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,780
I don't want people to see him.

918
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,780
I can understand.

919
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
But now it's okay.

920
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,780
As long as the reporter reports it,

921
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,780
you won't be misunderstood.

922
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,780
You can get out of the trouble.

923
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
Thank you.

924
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,780
Can you talk a little?

925
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,780
Yaoyao, you go to the car and wait for me.

926
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,780
Okay.

927
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,780
I saw it just now.

928
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
Super-duper.

929
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
You exposed it.

930
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
Yes.

931
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,780
I secretly took a video

932
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
and gave it to the media.

933
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,780
So what?

934
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
What do you dare to do?

935
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
I dare not.

936
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,780
Then you have to remember.

937
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
You have to stay away from Keruo.

938
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
Otherwise I will...

939
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,780
I will say it only once.

940
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
Listen to me.

941
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,780
We are all trying to climb up.

942
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,780
You are lucky.

943
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,780
Someone gave you a rope.

944
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,780
You went up the mountain.

945
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
And me?

946
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,780
I can only climb up with my hands.

947
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,780
My hands are rotten.

948
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,780
My bones are broken.

949
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,780
I still have to climb.

950
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,780
I, Shen Yan,

951
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,780
am a star.

952
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,780
I am no longer the little assistant.

953
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,780
No one can take everything from me.

954
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
No one can.

955
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,780
I don't want to take revenge with the Zuo family.

956
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,780
But my patience is limited.

957
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
I warn you one last time.

958
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,780
If you dare to block my way,

959
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,780
I will go up.

960
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
I will break your rope.

961
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,780
I will let you taste the taste of broken bones.

962
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
Do you hear me?

963
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
Remember my warning.

964
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
Are you crazy?

965
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
Everyone misunderstands Janshi.

966
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
It has nothing to do with her.

967
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
She has no idea.

968
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
She is too fake.

969
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
If I didn't know the truth,

970
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
I would have been fooled by her.

971
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,780
Please clarify the truth.

972
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
Please clarify the truth.

973
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
Please clarify the truth.

974
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
What she did was

975
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
first, she did what she promised us.

976
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
She clarified the truth for you.

977
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
Second,

978
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
she solved the rumor that she abandoned her parents.

979
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,780
She cleared the bad image of her society.

980
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,780
Third, she made a good self-punishment.

981
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,780
She won the public's sympathy for her.

982
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
It's so scary.

983
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
You just found out now.

984
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
Actually, the person around you

985
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
has always been a poisonous snake.

986
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
You were bitten today.

987
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
You are lucky.

988
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
Yes.

989
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
I am lucky.

990
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
I will be far away from her in the future.

991
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
Fortunately, the rumor is clear.

992
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
It's not over yet.

993
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
It's not over yet.

994
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
Don't forget.

995
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
She never told everyone

996
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,780
who spread the rumor of you and Yuan Liang.

997
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
I will go find the person.

998
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
Calm down.

999
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
Calm down.

1000
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,780
We only caught her

1001
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
for making up the scar.

1002
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
As for the rumor,

1003
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
we don't have any evidence.

1004
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,780
She will not admit it.

1005
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,780
I can tell the media.

1006
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Now the media is more inclined to her.

1007
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
She is a white lotus now.

1008
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
If you pour dirty water on her,

1009
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
it will only lead to the public's anger.

1010
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,780
What should I do?

1011
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,780
The best way to deal with the rumor

1012
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,780
is to deal with it in a simple way.

1013
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,780
When other explosive news comes out,

1014
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
and others forget about it,

1015
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
you will be safe.

1016
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,780
Should I keep waiting?

1017
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
You can only wait.

1018
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,780
Sit down.

1019
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,780
Be patient.

1020
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
What are you doing?

1021
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
I am rubbing your foot.

1022
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
I...

1023
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,780
Be gentle.

1024
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
It hurts?

1025
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
Do you know it hurts now?

1026
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,780
Why don't you know it hurts

1027
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
when you jump into the fire pit?

1028
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
So I said,

1029
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,780
are you possessed by the fallen god?

1030
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Not a big injury, but a minor one.

1031
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,780
Fortunately, what is the injury this time?

1032
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
If the wound is deformed,

1033
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
the monster can't even

1034
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
move a tree.

1035
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,780
Are you caring about me?

1036
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
No.

1037
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
I am really afraid of my nanny.

1038
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
Because the injury is serious,

1039
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
it can't clean the body.

1040
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
Then I will be in trouble.

1041
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
I am sorry.

1042
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
I always say this.

1043
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
Be gentle.

1044
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,780
I am gentle.

1045
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Actually, you are gentle.

1046
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
You are a good person.

1047
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
Be gentle.

1048
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,780
Such a big reaction.

1049
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,780
How can I let that guy kiss me?

1050
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
It's disgusting.

1051
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,780
I will go brush my teeth.

1052
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
Lu Zhou.

1053
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,780
Why are you in such a good mood today?

1054
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Why do you ask me out?

1055
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,780
Waiter.

1056
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,780
Please have some coffee.

1057
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,780
Thank you.

1058
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
Please enjoy.

1059
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
I don't deserve to be treated like this.

1060
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,780
I don't dare to drink this coffee.

1061
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,780
After leaving Zhan Mei,

1062
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,780
what new ideas do you have?

1063
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
Being an agent,

1064
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,780
I will treat everyone the same.

1065
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,780
I will take one step at a time.

1066
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,780
I don't believe it.

1067
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,780
If you really think so,

1068
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,780
it is impossible to leave Yue Le

1069
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,780
and come out to Dan Fei.

1070
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,780
I left Yue Le

1071
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,780
because he looked down on women.

1072
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,780
I just want to prove

1073
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,780
that I am more reliable than him

1074
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,780
to be an agent.

1075
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
I am more suitable than him.

1076
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,780
In Yue Le's hand,

1077
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,780
there is Tang Fei, the king card.

1078
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,780
You were with Zhan Mei,

1079
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,780
but you were able to fight with him.

1080
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,780
Who are you now?

1081
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,780
If you are here to talk to me,

1082
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,780
I am sorry.

1083
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,780
I will leave first.

1084
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,780
Anxin.

1085
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,780
We are all straightforward people.

1086
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,780
If you have anything to say, just say it.

1087
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,780
I like you so much.

1088
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,780
I will recommend an actor to you.

1089
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,780
Who?

1090
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
Jian Xi.

1091
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
Who?

1092
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
Him?

1093
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Did I hear it wrong?

1094
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,780
No, you didn't.

1095
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
Jian Xi.

1096
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,780
Why do you think

1097
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,780
I will bring a little actor

1098
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,780
who is not well-known,

1099
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,780
and has a lot of scandals?

1100
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,780
If this is said

1101
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,780
from someone else's mouth,

1102
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,780
I can understand.

1103
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
But from your mouth,

1104
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
I feel very strange.

1105
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Why is it strange?

1106
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,780
As an experienced agent,

1107
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,780
you should know that

1108
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,780
Jian Xi is very capable and smart.

1109
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
As long as you train him well,

1110
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,780
he will turn over very soon.

1111
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,780
He is very capable and smart.

1112
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,780
But he is capable and smart.

1113
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,780
Do I have to bring him?

1114
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,780
You don't feel very successful

1115
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,780
to support a female actor

1116
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,780
who has fallen into the valley?

1117
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,780
If you don't think so,

1118
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
then okay.

1119
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,780
Please.

1120
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,780
Anxin.

1121
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
Jian Xi is a natural actor.

1122
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,780
But there are few people

1123
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,780
with this kind of speciality.

1124
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,780
As an agent,

1125
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,780
you have been looking for

1126
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,780
such a person.

1127
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,780
If you coaxed Jian Xi,

1128
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
you are the real

1129
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,780
top agent.

1130
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,780
But I am also the top agent

1131
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,780
with Zhan Mei.

1132
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,780
Of course it's different.

1133
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,780
Zhan Mei has reached the end.

1134
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
When it comes to the top,

1135
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,780
the rest is to go to the bottom.

1136
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,780
As an agent,

1137
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
you should be very clear about this.

1138
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,780
Why did you leave Zhan Mei?

1139
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Isn't it to find

1140
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,780
a more valuable actor?

1141
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,780
Jian Xi.

1142
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,780
Wait a minute.

1143
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,780
Why are you looking for me?

1144
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,780
Don't misunderstand.

1145
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,780
I am not

1146
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,780
Zhan Mei's agent now.

1147
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,780
What does this have to do with me?

1148
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
Of course it has to do with you.

1149
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,780
Because from today on,

1150
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
I will be your agent.

1151
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,780
What?

1152
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,780
From today on,

1153
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,780
I, An Xin,

1154
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,780
will officially

1155
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,780
be your agent.

1156
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
If you want to see a doctor,

1157
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,780
turn left and take the bus.

1158
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
Jian Xi, I am serious.

1159
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,780
Jian Xi.

1160
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,780
The moonlight shines a little bit.

1161
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,780
With loneliness,

1162
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,780
it sings with me.

1163
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,780
Watching the bustling city,

1164
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,780
watching loneliness break the frost.

1165
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,780
Watching the tide rise and fall,

1166
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
the people are warm,

1167
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,780
the sky is dark and the sky is bright.

1168
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,780
Too much hope,

1169
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,780
in the end, you become desperate.

1170
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,780
Watching you come and go,

1171
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,780
holding on to the wind and frost,

1172
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,780
everything is in a trance.

1173
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,780
Too stubborn,

1174
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,780
I have to be young and crazy.

1175
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,780
There is a lie,

1176
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,780
so I don't forget the fire.

1177
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Looking back,

1178
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,780
there will be regrets.

1179
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,780
You and I,

1180
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,780
we are lost on the road.

1181
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
The sea and wind,

1182
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,780
don't think about anything.

1183
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,780
Where is the heart that is still in a trance?

1184
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,780
Just like this,

1185
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,780
waiting for a person to dawn.

1186
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,780
Just like this,

1187
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,780
waiting for a person to dawn.

1188
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,780
Just like this,

1189
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,780
waiting for a person to dawn.
