1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't care who you are

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, in the second year

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,280
I will turn into a magical eye

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,880
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
Put on the most solid gold armor

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,920
The weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Use all your strength to fight against the most real you

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the little tricks

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what rumors

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,080
I will definitely be invincible

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't care if you are willing

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,720
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,440
In the past, I kept this sweet

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,760
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,080
My heart is here

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
Even if the iron armor is invincible

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm only one you

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Episode 6

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
In this world, there is no more truth

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
What is this?

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,120
Jinxin, this is a medical syringe

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,960
Why is it on your body?

32
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,800
Are you sick?

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,680
Yes, what do you think?

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
Why did you bring a syringe here?

35
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,080
Yes, when you are sick

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,720
Will it affect the shooting of the rose life?

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,400
Who wouldn't be sick?

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
It's a big deal

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,560
I have several ulcerative colitis

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
In order to control my illness

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,200
I have to take it with me all the time

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,440
When you eat,

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,200
when you sleep,

44
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,560
you must always wear it.

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,240
I know you must be thinking,

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,840
you are sick,

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,080
why don't you make it earlier?

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,840
Because I don't want

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,400
everyone to look at me with the same eyes.

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,880
What are you going to do when you are filming?

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,760
You can't take this with you.

52
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,120
I plan to

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,360
take it off when I'm filming.

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,320
And wear it when I'm not filming.

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,160
I know

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,480
this is a hard process.

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,880
But I believe I can overcome it.

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,920
Director Yu,

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,520
if you think

60
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,800
my illness will affect the filming,

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,080
I understand

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,760
you want to change the actor temporarily.

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,160
Director Yu.

64
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,760
Let me tell you.

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,080
Given the situation,

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,640
the company is very sorry.

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,760
We hope you can choose the right actor in time.

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,640
If you need compensation,

69
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,880
we will do our best to cooperate.

70
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,800
Is he going to get married?

71
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,000
Is he going to get sick?

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,440
I don't think so.

73
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,320
He is going to get married.

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,200
He is really going to get sick.

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
He is going to get sick.

76
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
He is going to get sick.

77
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,000
Jinxi.

78
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,280
It will be very hard to film.

79
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,480
The heroine has a dance scene.

80
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,720
Are you sure you can hold on?

81
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,160
Director Yu.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,960
I am very happy that you can

83
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,280
tell us the truth before filming.

84
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,280
As a producer,

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,680
I must ask the actor to complete the filming.

86
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,960
Can you do it?

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,240
Miss Jian.

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,480
You should focus on your health.

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,920
As long as I can participate in the filming,

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
I will hold on.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,720
Friends.

92
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Let's welcome Miss Jianxi to the stage.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,960
Thank you.

94
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,680
I am going to announce

95
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,480
the heroine of the Rose's Life.

96
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,680
She is Jianxi.

97
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,640
Everyone.

98
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,360
I chose Jianxi

99
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,520
because I used to watch her performances.

100
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,920
She is very talented.

101
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,360
I noticed her outer will,

102
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,420
even she has the battlefield under control.

103
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
She finds time to handle her grief.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,200
She also wholeheartedly craves

105
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,340
acting as a woman's hero.

106
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,220
Her illness is not so serious.

107
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Please don't get nervous.

108
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,480
I believe she will do a very good jobelse.

109
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
I hope you can support her.

110
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,640
Thank you.

111
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,960
Please take a picture.

112
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,120
Take a picture.

113
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,360
Wait a minute.

114
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
There are

115
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,600
important people in this press conference.

116
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,680
Who are they?

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,560
Come on.

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Please.

119
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,120
It's Fei Ge.

120
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,040
It's Fei Ge.

121
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,680
Take a picture.

122
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,040
Take a picture.

123
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Take a picture.

124
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,600
Fei Ge.

125
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,600
Look over there.

126
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,360
Fei Ge.

127
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,000
It's Fei Ge.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,800
It's Fei Ge.

129
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,560
It's Fei Ge.

130
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,000
Isn't this a female drama?

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,720
Fei Ge, are you here

132
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,000
to participate in the rose life?

133
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,120
This is a female drama.

134
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,160
Why are you here?

135
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,800
Isn't Fei Ge going to

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,320
act in a movie next month?

137
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,680
Why did he change his mind?

138
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,440
Isn't he afraid of losing his job?

139
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,840
Yu Zhi Ping.

140
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,880
Tell us about it.

141
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,280
Mr. Yuan, you can announce it.

142
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,320
Tang Fei is determined to shoot the rose life.

143
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,920
He will act as a genius magician

144
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,080
for the first time.

145
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,760
Is this really a rose life?

146
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,480
Yes.

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,720
Is it to protect the cut?

148
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,680
Yes.

149
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,320
Okay.

150
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,480
Come on.

151
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,120
Please be careful.

152
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,960
Don't fall.

153
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,560
Come on.

154
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Be careful.

155
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,800
Please be careful.

156
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,800
Okay.

157
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,320
Good.

158
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,200
Good.

159
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,320
Thank you, Fei Ge.

160
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,640
Is this what you want me to see?

161
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,040
Lu Haichang.

162
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,960
It's yours.

163
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,840
I'll get it all back.

164
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,040
It's so beautiful.

165
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
It's so beautiful.

166
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
It's so beautiful.

167
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
It's so beautiful.

168
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
It's so beautiful.

169
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
It's so beautiful.

170
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
It's so beautiful.

171
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
It's so beautiful.

172
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
It's so beautiful.

173
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
It's so beautiful.

174
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,120
Yu Zhi Ping.

175
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,320
Thank you this time.

176
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,400
I really thought

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,720
you would change me.

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
Actually, I already knew

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,960
the news you announced today.

180
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,920
To say that your illness

181
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,160
won't affect the shooting itself.

182
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,280
But the female lead has a dance scene.

183
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,280
I really thought about

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
whether I should change you.

185
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,080
But someone wrote me a letter.

186
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Said you are a very different actor.

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,880
Even if you fall ill,

188
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,400
if you hear the action,

189
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,520
you will get up from the bed

190
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,880
and continue shooting.

191
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,680
That's why I'm listening to you

192
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,280
so hard inside.

193
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Who is this person?

194
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,480
It's your fan, Mr. T.

195
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,880
Right.

196
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Take a good shot.

197
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,920
If you can't act well,

198
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I can change you anytime.

199
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
Thank you, Yu Zhi Ping.

200
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,000
You're welcome.

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Thank you.

202
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Thank you.

203
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,960
Who is the person

204
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
behind what he said?

205
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,560
I don't know.

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
You don't know?

207
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,680
I must act well

208
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
in the American Life.

209
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,960
I know who it is.

210
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
Tell me.

211
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,240
What's your relationship?

212
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,080
Who? I don't know.

213
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,360
Tell me the truth.

214
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
I really don't know.

215
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,680
You really don't know?

216
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,920
I really don't know.

217
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,640
I don't believe it.

218
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,960
You're so nosy.

219
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,280
You already

220
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,920
rejected a big-time movie for him.

221
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,320
You even tried to help him

222
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,840
persuade the producer.

223
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,680
You've done so many things.

224
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,160
You really don't want anyone to know?

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
The dress he's wearing today,

226
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,200
is it too low-key?

227
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,200
Let's go.

228
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,040
If you don't go,

229
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,440
we'll be late for the next announcement.

230
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,240
Okay, let's go.

231
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,760
I didn't expect

232
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,240
that Jianxi would announce the illness

233
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
to the public.

234
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Teacher.

235
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,920
The

236
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
The

237
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
The

238
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
The

239
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,120
Jianxi is ready?

240
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,880
We're going to take the photo.

241
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,720
Hurry up.

242
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,280
What should we do, Yu Zhi Tian?

243
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,000
Why is Liu Yun suddenly so stubborn?

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,960
The movie will be on tomorrow.

245
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,080
Now you're telling me he's not stubborn?

246
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,320
Are you kidding me?

247
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I'll call him again

248
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,960
to find other suitable actresses.

249
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,360
The clothes are all customized by him.

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
Where have you been

251
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
to find such a suitable actress?

252
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,440
Look.

253
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Can I?

254
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Jianxi.

255
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
This movie

256
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
should be on me.

257
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,560
I think it's reliable.

258
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Jianxi's movie

259
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
is really great.

260
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,760
Jianxi.

261
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,360
Come here.

262
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,960
Let me introduce you to someone.

263
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,760
This is Sister Zhan Mei.

264
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,560
She was going to act

265
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
your mother's actress.

266
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,960
But she couldn't come because of something.

267
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,360
Luckily, Sister Zhan Mei was there.

268
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Otherwise, my movie

269
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
would be a big hit.

270
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,360
I've seen

271
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,560
the best actress in the movie.

272
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,160
You should learn from her.

273
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,960
Jianxi.

274
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,760
I hope we can work well together.

275
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Why?

276
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,160
Why?

277
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,760
Jianxi.

278
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,960
What's wrong?

279
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
What do you want?

280
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,960
Jianxi.

281
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,560
Sister Mei.

282
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Long time no see.

283
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,760
Producer Yu.

284
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,560
Sorry to bother you.

285
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
I have something to tell you.

286
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,160
Sister Mei.

287
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,760
You two talk.

288
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,960
You're still the same as before.

289
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,760
You're not calm at all when you meet something.

290
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,160
What do you want?

291
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,960
I don't understand what you mean.

292
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,160
You knew I was in this movie.

293
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,360
And you came here to act the mother's actress?

294
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,760
Sheng Xueling is a role that is worth challenging.

295
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,760
I just like the role.

296
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
You're lying.

297
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,760
Okay.

298
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,360
I'll tell you the truth.

299
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,960
I haven't had a chance to act for a long time.

300
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,360
I need a big movie

301
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,560
to increase my popularity.

302
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
So I can make more money.

303
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,760
Okay?

304
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,160
Okay.

305
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,160
I can ignore your purpose.

306
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,160
Let me act with you.

307
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,560
I can't act.

308
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
You're not a qualified actress.

309
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,360
After so many things,

310
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I thought

311
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,560
you've grown up.

312
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,160
I didn't expect you to let me down.

313
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
Because you hate someone

314
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,760
and give up a good movie

315
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,360
and a good role.

316
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,560
What's the difference between you and those

317
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
who act for fame and profit?

318
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,760
It's the same.

319
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,760
Acting is just a trivial thing for you.

320
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
It's not like that.

321
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,560
Then prove it to me.

322
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,760
Prove that no matter how much you hate me,

323
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,760
you will also act out the love between Yun Duo and his mother.

324
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,160
How is it?

325
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Is there any problem?

326
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Of course there is.

327
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Jian Xi is a very professional actress.

328
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
He will definitely play this role well.

329
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,760
Right?

330
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,160
You two all know that

331
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,960
the rose life is about the story of the heroine Yun Duo.

332
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,160
Yun Duo was abandoned by his mother since childhood.

333
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,360
In a performance,

334
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,760
she accidentally found her own mother,

335
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Sheng Xue Lin.

336
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,360
At that time, Sheng Xue Lin

337
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
was already a famous painter,

338
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
a noble woman of the upper class society,

339
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,960
and had a happy and happy family life.

340
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,160
With Yun Duo's efforts,

341
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
she finally got close to Sheng Xue Lin.

342
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
And the mother and daughter returned to good.

343
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,160
Today I'm going to shoot the first scene.

344
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,960
When Yun Duo was performing,

345
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,160
he suddenly found his own mother.

346
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,560
Yun Duo,

347
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,160
I hope that from your eyes,

348
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,560
you can see the emotions and excitement

349
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,360
that you have been suppressing for the past ten years.

350
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
The shock.

351
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
The excitement.

352
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,160
The shock.

353
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Do you understand?

354
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Okay?

355
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,760
Come on.

356
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,360
Everyone.

357
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,160
Let's start.

358
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Let's start.

359
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Love is not about losing.

360
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
In the end,

361
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,560
there is no justice.

362
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,360
At least kiss me.

363
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I'm a sweet talker.

364
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,360
You don't understand me.

365
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
I believe you want something.

366
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Love is just a story.

367
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Let your heart be angry.

368
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,360
Never be a rebel.

369
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,960
Men are not reliable.

370
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Women will grow old.

371
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,760
Only that time.

372
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,960
Diamond is the best friend of women.

373
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,160
Interesting.

374
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,560
Come on.

375
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Mei, come in.

376
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,560
What's wrong?

377
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Can you hold on?

378
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
How is it?

379
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Can you hold on?

380
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,960
I think the doctor is very serious.

381
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,360
Jinxi.

382
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
How are you?

383
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,960
Jinxi.

384
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
What's wrong with you?

385
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,960
How are you?

386
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,560
Are you okay?

387
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
I'm fine.

388
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Don't move.

389
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,960
Come on.

390
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Slow down.

391
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Slow down.

392
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,360
Slow down.

393
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,960
Does it hurt?

394
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,360
Do you want to take a break?

395
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
It's okay.

396
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,360
I can do it.

397
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,960
Well,

398
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,160
take a break for an hour.

399
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,560
Thank you, director.

400
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,760
Thank you, director.

401
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,160
Let's go.

402
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,760
Take a break.

403
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Everyone, get ready.

404
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Take a break.

405
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,160
Slow down.

406
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,960
If you really can't hold on,

407
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,560
you'd better quit.

408
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,960
Otherwise, you'll waste everyone's time.

409
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,960
Don't worry.

410
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,360
I won't tolerate you.

411
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,960
Director,

412
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,560
shoot my scene first.

413
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Jinxi, come on.

414
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Drink some water.

415
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,360
What's wrong?

416
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,560
Does it hurt?

417
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm fine.

418
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
You're so swollen.

419
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,560
I can tell the producer.

420
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm fine.

421
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,960
I'll take a break.

422
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,360
Well,

423
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,160
I'll go do something.

424
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
I'll be back later.

425
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,560
Take care of yourself.

426
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,160
Okay.

427
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,960
Stop playing.

428
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,560
What's wrong?

429
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,760
Do you know

430
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,160
if you force Jinxi to act,

431
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
you'll kill her?

432
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,760
It's none of your business.

433
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,360
I'm her agent.

434
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,560
She can't act.

435
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,160
She's practicing dancing.

436
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,360
If she gets sick,

437
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,760
what will she do in the next life?

438
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,560
As long as she's protected,

439
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,760
she'll be fine.

440
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,160
She can overcome this difficulty.

441
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,760
She will.

442
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
You're so selfish.

443
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,920
Platform

444
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,960
What time is it?

445
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Why are you working extra hours?

446
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Business is a lot of work for you.

447
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,760
I see.

448
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Only those who are flourishing

449
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,960
should work so hard.

450
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,560
It's how the ladies work,

451
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,160
right?

452
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,560
Why can you say

453
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,160
Every time I'm unhappy,

454
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
you always come out to read the sky.

455
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I work hard to make money.

456
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Am I wrong?

457
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,320
Why do you guys always say

458
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,640
I'm the winner, the loser?

459
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,280
I'm eating your rice.

460
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,080
Because you're not like a girl.

461
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,520
You're like a man.

462
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,440
Here we go again.

463
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
Is it because our girl is better than your boy?

464
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,840
We're called man.

465
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,280
You guys are so jealous.

466
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,800
You're so ridiculous.

467
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,120
I...

468
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,640
Am I not your agent?

469
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,560
You're happy with me?

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,080
I'm telling you,

471
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,440
I can't do it.

472
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm happy to be a strong woman.

473
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,280
I want to be of personal value.

474
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,360
I'm willing to be a good agent

475
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,760
even if I'm not in love at 30.

476
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,520
What's wrong with me?

477
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,560
None of your business.

478
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
I'm happy.

479
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Anxin, why are you crying?

480
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Tell me.

481
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
What's wrong?

482
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,480
I think I can't do anything right.

483
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Why?

484
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Because I'm a woman.

485
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
I'm not a woman.

486
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
I'm a woman.

487
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm a woman.

488
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
What's wrong with you?

489
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
I'm a woman.

490
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
I can't do anything right.

491
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,000
I was just kidding.

492
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
How can I be so mad at you?

493
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
I...

494
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm wrong, okay?

495
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Please don't cry, okay?

496
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
I'm sorry.

497
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Yuan Le.

498
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you know that

499
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Jian Xin is sick?

500
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
She's very sick.

501
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,600
I always tell her not to act.

502
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,800
She doesn't listen to me.

503
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
If she keeps acting,

504
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,800
she'll die.

505
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,000
I've been with her for so long.

506
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,600
But I don't think I can do anything right.

507
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
I feel so bad.

508
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm so bad.

509
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:40,640
Qian완's

510
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:40,720
Qian완's

511
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:40,800
Qian완's

512
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:40,880
Qian완's

513
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:40,960
Qian완's

514
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,000
Qian완's

515
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,080
Qian완's

516
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,160
Qian완's

517
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,220
Qian완's

518
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,360
Qian완's

519
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,420
Qian완's

520
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,480
Qian완's

521
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:41,560
Qian완's

522
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,620
Qian완's

523
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:41,680
Qian완's

524
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:41,840
Qian완's

525
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:41,920
Qian완's

526
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,200
Qian examples

527
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Qian examples

528
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,400
Well.

529
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,600
If it's not a big day,

530
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I'll leave first.

531
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
The End

532
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
That's the way it is.

533
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
You decide what to do.

534
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Here, your favorite dessert.

535
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Eat.

536
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Look at you.

537
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
You've been an agent for so long.

538
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
When you're facing an artist,

539
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
you should control your emotions.

540
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
But I treat him as my good friend.

541
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
I really can't bear to see him like this.

542
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
You forgot?

543
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
When you first entered the industry, I told you

544
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
that all decisions are made by the actor himself.

545
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
It's not up to you to take the lead.

546
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,600
But the actor's artistic life is limited.

547
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Every year, every month, every minute,

548
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
are very important to him.

549
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
He trusts me and gives me the future.

550
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,600
How can I not help him?

551
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
You're right. Eat.

552
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
You really don't know why

553
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Jian Xi wants to shoot the show?

554
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
What do you mean?

555
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
He said he wanted to keep filming.

556
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
But he's worried that after the treatment,

557
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
he'll have a sequela.

558
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,600
But I don't think that's the real reason.

559
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,600
What's the real reason?

560
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Are they all dressed up?

561
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
If Jian Xi's dance moves can't be completed,

562
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
we can't waste time.

563
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Have you found the person who's going to be the coach?

564
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Yes.

565
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
If we need to change, we can do it right away.

566
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Okay.

567
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Come on.

568
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Everyone, get ready.

569
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Come on. Be careful.

570
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Hurry up.

571
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Come on.

572
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Is the camera ready?

573
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Yes.

574
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Okay.

575
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Ready. Action.

576
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Come on.

577
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Jian Xi's dance moves are really good.

578
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
You can't tell that he's injured.

579
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Yes.

580
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Come on. Cut.

581
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Good.

582
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Good.

583
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Good.

584
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Good.

585
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Good.

586
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Good.

587
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Good, Jian Xi.

588
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Come on.

589
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Come on.

590
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Get ready for the next scene.

591
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Okay. Get ready for the next scene.

592
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Okay.

593
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Come here.

594
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Okay.

595
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Coming.

596
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Be careful.

597
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Jian Xi.

598
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Teacher.

599
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
You dance very well.

600
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,600
I heard that Flamingo's first dancer,

601
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Aida Gmais,

602
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,100
she had several

603
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,600
and became the best dancer.

604
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Since she can do it, I can do it too.

605
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Jian Xi.

606
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Do you have confidence in the next scene with Zhan Mei?

607
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Yun Duo found his own mother.

608
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
He asked her to admit himself, but she was rejected.

609
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Jian Xi.

610
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Jian Xi.

611
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Tang Fei.

612
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
If you don't have confidence,

613
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I can adjust the shooting plan.

614
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Teacher, don't worry.

615
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
I won't let these irrelevant people

616
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
interfere with the most important thing I think.

617
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
No matter how difficult it is,

618
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I will make this play good.

619
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Okay.

620
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Come on.

621
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm leaving.

622
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Go to rest.

623
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
Why did you say

624
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
he had to work so hard for this scene?

625
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
You will understand soon.

626
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Tang Fei.

627
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Where are you going?

628
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Come out and take a breath.

629
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Tell me.

630
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Are you unhappy or jealous?

631
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Don't look at me like that.

632
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
I won't say it if it's not important.

633
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
You have to think it over.

634
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
If it goes on like this,

635
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Jian Xi will definitely be taken away by others.

636
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Look.

637
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Lu Zhou must have other intentions.

638
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Forget it. I won't tell you.

639
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Besides, you are not in a hurry.

640
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
You are still stubborn.

641
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Stubborn?

642
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Mom, I'm Yun Duo.

643
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I traveled a long way to Shanghai

644
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
just to find you.

645
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Really?

646
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Do you remember when you were a kid,

647
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,600
you held me and told me about my brother?

648
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Your voice was so moving.

649
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Mom, I really miss you.

650
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
You got the wrong person.

651
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Cut.

652
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Jian Xi, when you were acting,

653
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
you couldn't see

654
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
any love and desire in her eyes.

655
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Think about it.

656
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
After many years,

657
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
you suddenly see your real mother.

658
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Shouldn't you be more excited?

659
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
I got it.

660
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Remember.

661
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
You are here to find your most wanted mother.

662
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
This kind of emotion

663
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
may stand out

664
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
as the feeling of crying, okay?

665
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Come on.

666
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Come on, all departments.

667
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Check in the end.

668
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Get ready for the rehearsal.

669
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Come on, get ready.

670
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Ready.

671
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Ready.

672
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Action.

673
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Five scenes, one scene, one time.

674
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Mom, I'm Yun Duo.

675
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I traveled a long way to Shanghai

676
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
just to find you.

677
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Do you remember when you were a kid,

678
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,600
you held me and told me about my brother?

679
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Your voice was so moving.

680
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Mom, I really miss you.

681
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I miss you.

682
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
You got the wrong person.

683
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Who would get the wrong mother?

684
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
You didn't want to recognize me.

685
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Why didn't you recognize me?

686
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Take it.

687
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Don't come back.

688
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Mom,

689
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
I thought

690
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
you would love me like I love you.

691
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
You always miss me.

692
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
I thought you would hug me tightly

693
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
when you saw me.

694
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
I thought you would be so happy.

695
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I didn't expect you...

696
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
What do you know?

697
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
If they knew who you were

698
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
and knew my past,

699
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
all the hard work I've got

700
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
would be gone.

701
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
I've forgotten you.

702
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Why did you come back?

703
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
You have nothing to do with my life now.

704
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Don't bother me again.

705
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
You can't recognize me

706
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
because you're afraid that people will know

707
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
you have a daughter who is a dancer in Bai Le School.

708
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
You didn't recognize your own daughter

709
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
for the sake of the Ming family.

710
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Yes.

711
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Because your appearance

712
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
will make me lose my reputation

713
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
and my reputation.

714
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
No one wants a child.

715
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
You...

716
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
No one wants a child.

717
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
No one wants a child.

718
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
No one wants a child.

719
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
No one wants a child.

720
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
No one wants a child.

721
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Why did you give birth to me?

722
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Why didn't you raise me

723
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
when you gave birth to me?

724
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
I'm a human.

725
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
I'm a living human.

726
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Why are the lines different?

727
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
This is the freedom of Jian Xi.

728
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Say something.

729
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Answer my question.

730
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
You're greedy for fame and self-sufficiency.

731
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
But you're so kind and noble

732
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
in front of the public.

733
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
What do you want to say?

734
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
What are you talking about?

735
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Wait.

736
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Let her continue.

737
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
She's going to make a drama.

738
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Don't bother her.

739
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Let her continue acting.

740
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
You let her get into such a painful situation.

741
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Do you want to seal her?

742
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
I said it.

743
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Let her continue acting.

744
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Insolent.

745
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
When I was young,

746
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I was bullied by others.

747
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I always told myself,

748
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
it's okay.

749
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
I have a mother.

750
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
My mother loves me very much.

751
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
I can touch your photos again and again.

752
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
That's the most precious thing in my life.

753
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
I love her so much.

754
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Later I knew,

755
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I knew you had a husband and a daughter.

756
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
I never thought about

757
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
disturbing your life.

758
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
I just want to see you.

759
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
I just want to see you.

760
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
But you...

761
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
If you still have a little affection for me,

762
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
and a little conscience,

763
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
you shouldn't treat me like this.

764
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
You're not suitable to be a mother

765
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
when you're so kind to your own daughter.

766
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Can we end it?

767
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Okay.

768
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Come on.

769
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Get ready for the next scene.

770
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Okay.

771
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Light.

772
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Come on.

773
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Are you satisfied?

774
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
She acted very well.

775
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
She won't let you do whatever you want.

776
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I'm sorry.

777
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
I'm sorry.

778
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Yes.

779
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Sister Mei, are you okay?

780
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm fine.

781
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Really?

782
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
You don't look good.

783
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Yes.

784
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
I almost couldn't get out

785
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
because of the deep acting.

786
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Qian Xi acted really well.

787
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
I almost thought you were real mothers.

788
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
I'll go and make up.

789
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Okay.

790
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
You go ahead.

791
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
Yun Duo should be very sad

792
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
about that scene.

793
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
But Jian Xi acted

794
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
a little bit hateful.

795
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
It's really scary.

796
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
But I think it's pretty good.

797
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
What do you think?

798
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
I think it's good.

799
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Although it's not the same as the script,

800
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
it's more explosive.

801
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Qian Xi,

802
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
congratulations.

803
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
You acted very well.

804
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
I'm right.

805
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
An actor who knows the play

806
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
will put himself

807
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
completely into the role.

808
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
You are a person

809
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
with a strong personal emotion.

810
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
You should use him well.

811
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Is this the purpose

812
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
of you asking him to play the role?

813
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Have you considered his feelings?

814
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I once said

815
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
that the actor's personal experience

816
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
is the most precious wealth.

817
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Didn't he just

818
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
explain this point?

819
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Can't you see

820
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
that he is very painful?

821
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
That's not important.

822
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
What's important?

823
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
It's the most important thing

824
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
to overcome emotional trauma.

825
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Lu Zhou, you are a lunatic.

826
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
You never

827
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
see Qian Xi as a person.

828
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Qian Xi,

829
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
no matter what happens,

830
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
you have to play this play well

831
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
and face your sister bravely.

832
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
No matter if you have hatred

833
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
or pain in your heart,

834
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
you have to show it completely.

835
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Don't listen to him.

836
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Respect your own heart.

837
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
If you don't want to play, let's not play.

838
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
We're not playing.

839
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Get out of the way.

840
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Anxin.

841
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Anxin,

842
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
you are fired.

843
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Teacher.

844
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Get out of here.

845
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Qian Xi,

846
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm the only one you need.

847
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
You are enough.

848
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
These irrelevant people

849
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
don't let them affect your career.

850
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Go.

851
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
No matter how painful

852
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
and hateful your heart is,

853
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
you have to remember

854
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
that the camera is always facing you.

855
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
As long as you can play this play well,

856
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
you can

857
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
change from pain

858
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
to a real actor.

859
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Baby,

860
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
you never learn a lesson.

861
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Do you remember

862
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
you helped Zou Xiao

863
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
to take everything from him

864
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
and was eventually

865
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
sold out by him?

866
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Yes.

867
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
I was sold out by him.

868
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
You were the one who found him.

869
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
You should have treated him well

870
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
if you had done so.

871
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Do you know what you are called?

872
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Ungrateful.

873
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
If I didn't help you

874
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
get rid of this scoundrel,

875
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
how could I have been the one

876
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
who helped him?

877
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Think about it.

878
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Zou Xiao

879
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
played the big card

880
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
and offended others.

881
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
He then put all the blame on you.

882
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
As his agent,

883
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
how much did you suffer?

884
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
If I didn't help you,

885
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
why would I bother

886
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
to dig him out?

887
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Why didn't you tell me

888
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
that you helped me?

889
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I didn't know.

890
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
How could you tell him

891
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
that you helped him

892
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
after helping someone?

893
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
I did it for you.

894
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
Even if you always blamed me,

895
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
I still took the responsibility.

896
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
You are so stubborn.

897
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
You don't remember anything.

898
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Your brain is being squeezed.

899
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Me?

900
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
My brain is being squeezed?

901
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
From now on,

902
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
I won't help you

903
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
clean up the mess.

904
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I am

905
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
a stubborn person.

906
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
I think he is good.

907
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
I will treat him well for the rest of my life.

908
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Zou Xiao is not good.

909
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
But I thought

910
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
I brought him along.

911
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
I don't want him to be wronged.

912
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
But Jian Xi is different from him.

913
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Jian Xi is really passionate about acting.

914
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
It's really not easy for him

915
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
to get to this point.

916
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
I don't want him to be ruined

917
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
by Lu Zhou.

918
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Baby,

919
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
think about it this way.

920
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Maybe

921
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
this is not

922
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
such a serious matter.

923
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
You don't know.

924
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
This is more serious

925
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
than I thought.

926
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
What are you going to do?

927
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
I am thinking

928
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
that this person

929
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
is the key to solving the problem.

930
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
I am thinking about it.

931
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Madam,

932
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Miss An is waiting for you inside.

933
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
An Xin?

934
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
An Xin?

935
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
You are here to persuade me?

936
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Yes.

937
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Who else has been here?

938
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
You don't have to say it.

939
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Anyway,

940
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
I have nothing to do with Jian Xi.

941
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Sister Mei,

942
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
I don't understand.

943
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Why are you so cruel?

944
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
You were there

945
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
and you saw it.

946
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Jian Xi hates me so much.

947
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Even if I go to

948
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
ask for her forgiveness now,

949
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
it's too late.

950
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
How do you know

951
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
if you don't go?

952
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Have you done anything

953
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
to Jian Xi?

954
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Except for talking bad about each other,

955
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
have you ever treated her well?

956
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Of course she hates you.

957
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Not to mention that

958
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Jian Xi has been looking for her mother.

959
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Have you ever experienced this kind of feeling?

960
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Sister Mei,

961
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
that's all I want to say.

962
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Think about it.

963
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Sorry to bother you.

964
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
The check-up report from last year

965
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
is out.

966
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
It's really Bai Xue Bin.

967
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Please help me check

968
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
the relationship between these two people.

969
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Although it has been many years,

970
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
I believe that if you are interested in checking,

971
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
it will be difficult to leave clues.

972
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
But you must remember

973
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
that I don't want

974
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
a story that doesn't have a story.

975
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I want solid evidence.

976
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Okay, Mr. Qi.

977
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Don't worry.

978
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Tang Fei,

979
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
in this play,

980
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
you are acting as

981
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
a wandering magician.

982
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
You are in love with the cloud in the play.

983
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
It's you

984
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
that made him understand

985
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
love and forgiveness.

986
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
I hope you can get rid of

987
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
the urban performance now.

988
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
I need a completely different

989
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
and a new magician.

990
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
You can rest assured about the special effects.

991
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
I will let the substitute to help you complete it.

992
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
In the later stage,

993
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
add some special effects,

994
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
rendering and editing,

995
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
you will definitely perform well.

996
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Leave it to me.

997
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Li Hao.

998
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
You did it.

999
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Li Hao, you did it.

1000
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
You did it.

1001
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Great.

1002
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Great.

1003
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
You played it.

1004
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
You know how to play it.

1005
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Really.

1006
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
It's very strange.

1007
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
So amazing.

1008
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
He did it so well.

1009
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
You did it very well.

1010
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Can Tang Fei become a magician?

1011
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Of course.

1012
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
He prepared a lot for today.

1013
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
He specially found a magician

1014
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
to study many things day and night.

1015
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
He is actually doing it right.

1016
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,480
No wonder he's so young.

1017
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,560
He's in such a position.

1018
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,720
He's back.

1019
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,240
Give me a toast.

1020
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,080
Cheers.

1021
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,560
How did he do that?

1022
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,520
I don't know.

1023
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,520
So amazing.

1024
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,960
If my love makes you feel burdened,

1025
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,400
I'll take a step back

1026
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
and be your Mr. T.

1027
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,640
Jianxi.

1028
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,760
Jianxi, are you okay?

1029
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
I'm fine.

1030
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,680
That's good.

1031
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,000
We've finished today's play.

1032
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,040
Get changed.

1033
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,160
I'll send you back.

1034
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,240
Okay.

1035
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,720
Miss Jing,

1036
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,600
this is a card from a gentleman.

1037
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,800
Zuo Gang.

1038
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,440
Jianxi, you're running away.

1039
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,800
What did you say?

1040
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,520
Remember what I told you?

1041
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,800
No matter how cruel the reality is,

1042
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,840
you have to face it bravely.

1043
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,760
These experiences

1044
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,600
will be the most precious

1045
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,200
wealth in your performance.

1046
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,640
Go.

1047
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,520
See what he says.

1048
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,840
One, two, three.

1049
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,400
Rush over.

1050
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,720
In the midst of the chaos

1051
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,440
you biggest dream used to be

1052
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,600
justice.

1053
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,240
Joy is lost.

1054
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,880
We must find it in a way

1055
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,640
that can be heard suddenly.

1056
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,760
Can we hear a voice

1057
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,840
come from the child?

1058
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,600
Right.

1059
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,440
If you don't listen to me,

1060
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,120
why attraction will not play?

1061
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,720
I wish what your voice

1062
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,040
will be heard me.

1063
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Look at the prosperity and prosperity, look at the loneliness and the sadness

1064
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Look at the tide, the people, the cold, the cold, the dark, the bright

1065
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Too much hope, in the end, you become desperate

1066
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Look at you coming and going, holding on to the wind and frost, all wandering

1067
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Too stubborn, but still young and crazy

1068
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,800
There is absurdity, don't forget the fire

1069
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,800
Looking back, all the grudges will have a look

1070
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,800
You and I, gradually lost on the road

1071
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Too crazy, don't think about anything

1072
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Where is the heart that is still in a trance?

1073
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Just like this, wait for a person until dawn

1074
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Just like this, wait for a person until dawn

1075
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Just like this, wait for a person until dawn
