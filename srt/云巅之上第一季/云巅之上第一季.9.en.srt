1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,720
I don't care who is more beautiful

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, in the second year

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will be a magical eye

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,760
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most ancient gold armor

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
The weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Use all your strength to fight against the most real you

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
No matter what the little tricks

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what rumors

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,000
I will definitely be invincible

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't care if you are willing

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,360
In the past, I kept this sweetness

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,680
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,000
My heart is here

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
Even if the iron armor is invincible

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,880
I'm only one you

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
The Love by Hypnotic

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Episode 16

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Ji Qing, I think Mr. Qi is very handsome

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
He is cool and cool

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
He is a domineering president

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
I think he is very compatible with you

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Don't joke

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
I'm not joking

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Mr. Qi is so cold to others

36
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
It's different from Ji Qing

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,320
I say, don't you feel anything for him?

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Of course not

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,320
In my heart, he is just my boss

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Why?

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Because I hate people like him who are trying to be a lawyer

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Calm down

43
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
I am very calm now

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
Otherwise, can you sit here?

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
If it doesn't work, I'll open it

46
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Shut up

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
I tell you

48
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
The more you are in this situation

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
The more you need to control your emotions

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
That's because you never care about me

51
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
If you really care about him

52
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
You should be more righteous

53
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Shut up

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Ok, I'll shut up

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Ji Qing, what are you doing?

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Put down the knife

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
I told you to put down the knife

58
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Go away

59
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Calm down

60
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Tang Fei

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Calm down

62
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
Let Ji Qing go first

63
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Let him go?

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Why?

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Don't you want to see me?

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
I'm standing in front of you now

67
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
If you don't have him

68
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,320
You will not be able to see me

69
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
I'm not afraid of you

70
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
I'm not afraid of you

71
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
If you don't have him

72
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Will you still come to see me?

73
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
What are you doing?

74
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Do you want to die?

75
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Don't come over

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
If you dare to get close to me again

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
I will cut his face with a knife

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Don't be impulsive

79
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
What do you want now?

80
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
My parents are all gone

81
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm the only one left

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm so lonely

83
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Tang Fei, you are my favorite person

84
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I want you to accompany me

85
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Ok, I can stay with you

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
But you let him go first

87
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I don't believe it

88
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
If I let him go

89
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
What if you ignore me?

90
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
What do you want?

91
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,320
I remember

92
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
It's him

93
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
You like Tang Fei, right?

94
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Who are you?

95
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
We met twice

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Do you remember?

97
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Go away

98
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
I don't want to talk to you

99
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
You think Ji Qin is Tang Fei's girlfriend

100
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
So you brought her here, right?

101
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
You got it wrong

102
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
I am Tang Fei's girlfriend

103
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Li Sanghu

104
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
I didn't see them together

105
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
The news is all nonsense

106
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
Do you remember the first time we met

107
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
I walked out of Tang Fei's house

108
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
In fact, we have been together

109
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Just didn't open to the outside

110
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
impossible

111
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Then he

112
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Silly, you got the wrong person

113
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Look at him, he's bleeding

114
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
If it goes on like this

115
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
He will die

116
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
He admitted it himself

117
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
So I came

118
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
I came to correct my mistakes

119
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Correct mistakes

120
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
You are so pitiful

121
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
You want to see Tang Fei

122
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,320
You hurt others like this

123
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
You are a pitiful pursuit

124
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
I am not

125
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
You tied Ji Qin here

126
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Finally found yourself wrong

127
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
It's none of your business

128
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Are you angry?

129
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Just angry

130
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Really like a person

131
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Is hoping for the other party to be happy

132
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Just like those who really love

133
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Tang Fei's fans

134
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
See him progress a little bit and be happy

135
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
See him experience failure

136
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Will be sad

137
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Even if Tang Fei has a girlfriend

138
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Should also bless

139
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
But you are different

140
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Your so-called pursuit

141
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Just to seek attention

142
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
You are so pitiful and lonely

143
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Just an excuse for Tang Fei

144
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Not like this

145
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Your parents left you

146
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
No one cares about you, you are sad

147
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
So you did this

148
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Want to get attention from everyone

149
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
You say you love Tang Fei

150
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
This is not love at all, it is the damage of the heaven

151
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,320
I don't

152
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Because of you

153
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Tang Fei canceled the shooting schedule

154
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
I'm afraid all night

155
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Because of you

156
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Everyone is hurt

157
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Life is threatened, is this your love?

158
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Your love is too scary

159
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
This is your fault

160
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Without your words, things won't be like this

161
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
What did I do wrong?

162
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
You took away my Tang Fei

163
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
You say that Tang Fei is yours

164
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Is he really yours?

165
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
It doesn't matter

166
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
From now on

167
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
He will definitely remember me

168
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Yes, he will remember you

169
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
But you will be his most hated person

170
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Shut up, I will shut you up

171
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Tang Fei, Juxiu

172
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Tang Fei, are you ok?

173
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Juxiu, I'm fine

174
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Come, get up

175
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Get up, the second round, we will start the second round

176
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
I will send Jingting to the hospital

177
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Be careful

178
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
Jingxin, go back by yourself

179
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Wait

180
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
It's ok to be abandoned

181
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
I was abandoned by my mom

182
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
This world

183
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
doesn't exist because of you

184
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
The way of the heaven

185
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
will only make people hate you more

186
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
From now on

187
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Live a good life

188
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
I will be your mother

189
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
I will be your mother

190
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
I will be your mother

191
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I will be your mother

192
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
From now on, live a good life

193
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Live like a human

194
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Show those who abandoned you

195
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
What are you waiting for?

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Live a good life

197
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Go

198
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Are you ok?

199
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
You are hurt

200
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Is it serious?

201
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I'm fine

202
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Miss Ji, I will change your medicine

203
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Doctor

204
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I want to ask

205
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Will there be scars?

206
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
The wound on your forehead is very deep

207
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Will there be scars?

208
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
It depends on the recovery

209
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
So, there will be scars

210
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
What will happen after it's healed?

211
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Don't worry

212
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
We will try our best

213
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
At most

214
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
It's just a light cut

215
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
What do you mean by light cut?

216
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm an actress

217
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
I can't have any scars

218
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Do you know?

219
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Don't worry

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
I will find the best doctor

221
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
To treat you

222
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
How can you promise?

223
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
You are all liars

224
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Can you do the surgery?

225
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Even if I do the surgery

226
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
There will be scars

227
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
No

228
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Dad

229
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
I don't want

230
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
If I can't act

231
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
What else can I do?

232
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
The biggest meaning of my life

233
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Is to be an actress

234
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
What should I do?

235
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Don't worry

236
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Calm down

237
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
I want to go out

238
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
I want to go now

239
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Let me go

240
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Calm down

241
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Go out

242
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Don't look at me

243
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Calm down

244
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Calm down

245
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Don't be afraid

246
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Tang Fei

247
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
What should I do if I can act?

248
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Don't leave me

249
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Don't leave me

250
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Ji Ji, you will be fine

251
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Your wounds will heal soon

252
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
You will be as beautiful as before

253
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
You will be beautiful

254
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
I want to act

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
No

256
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Don't leave me

257
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I want to act

258
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
You can do the surgery

259
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
You won't leave scars

260
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Right?

261
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
No matter how many times you do the surgery

262
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
You will be perfect

263
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
You are an actress

264
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Your profession is special

265
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
If you...

266
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
No ifs and buts

267
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
I want the best doctor to do the surgery

268
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
You must have no flaws

269
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Sorry

270
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Sorry, doctor

271
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Miss Ji is not in a stable mood

272
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
So we are really afraid

273
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
If she goes on like this

274
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
It may affect her condition

275
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
For the patient

276
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
It's important to keep a good mood

277
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Before she fully recovers

278
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Please pay attention

279
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Don't make her too excited

280
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Keep an optimistic attitude

281
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
How optimistic? She is a actress

282
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Even more important than her life

283
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Sorry

284
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Thank you, doctor

285
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
We will take good care of her

286
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
It's okay

287
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Doctor, please

288
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Tao Fei

289
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
You have to take full responsibility

290
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
I know

291
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
What do you plan to do?

292
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
What do you want me to do?

293
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Because you won't get hurt

294
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Do you know she loved to be pretty since childhood?

295
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Her biggest dream is to be a real actress

296
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
But she may not be able to stand in front of the camera

297
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Are you not responsible?

298
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
What do you want me to do?

299
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
You should treat her well

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Qing Sen

301
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I feel guilty now

302
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Really

303
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
But it has nothing to do with love

304
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
I don't want to listen to your nonsense

305
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
You have to take a practical action

306
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
I know you are guilty

307
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Ji Qing got hurt

308
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
I will take all the responsibility

309
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
I will stay with her until she recovers

310
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
But you have to listen to me

311
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
What I want to do

312
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
You don't have to teach me

313
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
I will go with her now

314
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Sorry

315
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
You have to shoot this afternoon

316
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
I have to go to see Ji Qing

317
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
I want to see her

318
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Why do you worry about her?

319
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
You should worry about your boyfriend

320
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
What are you talking about?

321
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
You are so busy now

322
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Although you live in the same building

323
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
You don't have time to meet her

324
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
You can go to see her when you are free

325
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
You are not worried?

326
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Because Ji Qing is sick

327
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
She is sick, so I go to see her

328
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Why doesn't she come to see you when you are sick?

329
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
Ji Qing got hurt because of Tang Fei

330
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
She did it on purpose

331
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
What's wrong?

332
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Stop looking

333
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Be careful

334
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
I told you

335
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
You should look after your boyfriend

336
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Look at those two ducks

337
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Juxi

338
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
They are not ducks

339
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Really?

340
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Juxi

341
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
What's wrong?

342
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Nothing

343
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Then we could become item

344
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Good

345
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
I knew you were wrong

346
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
cíao

347
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Wait

348
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,800
Watchi

349
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,280
Move

350
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Do 이게

351
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
setups

352
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Doctor, how is my father?

353
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
He is stable.

354
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
But he needs to be very careful these days.

355
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Doctor, when will he wake up?

356
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
His head is seriously injured.

357
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
His brain is bleeding.

358
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
The situation is not optimistic.

359
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
But don't worry.

360
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
We will try our best to treat him.

361
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Thank you.

362
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Don't worry too much.

363
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Uncle will definitely wake up.

364
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
He will.

365
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Hello.

366
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
What's wrong?

367
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
My mother passed away.

368
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Don't be sad.

369
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Miss Jian is very popular recently.

370
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
She is also very busy.

371
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
It's not easy to see you.

372
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
What did Mr. Qi ask me to do?

373
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
To be honest,

374
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I hope you break up with Tang Fei immediately.

375
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Break up?

376
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Yes.

377
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Why?

378
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Tang Fei is like a sun in the sky.

379
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
You are also good at it.

380
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
If anything happens at this time,

381
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
it's not good for both of you.

382
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
And don't forget,

383
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
in the hearts of the public,

384
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
the love is the same as Tang Fei.

385
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Tang Fei and I will decide

386
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
our own affairs.

387
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Don't bother.

388
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
I have an announcement to make.

389
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
I'll go first.

390
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
Listen to me.

391
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Break up with Tang Fei immediately.

392
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
I don't like you,

393
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
a despicable person,

394
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
teaching me how to do things.

395
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
I have limited patience.

396
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
I hope you don't push me too hard.

397
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Are you threatening me?

398
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
You have done too many things

399
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
that are too close to the ground.

400
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
I'm not afraid of one more thing.

401
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
If you really want to destroy it,

402
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,320
it's easy to destroy you.

403
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Whatever.

404
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Hello, Shen Yan?

405
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
Change a pose.

406
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Good.

407
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Good.

408
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
A little colder.

409
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Okay.

410
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Let's change another one.

411
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Jian Xi's price is getting higher and higher.

412
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
You really have a good eye.

413
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
I don't have a good eye.

414
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
It's because he's working hard.

415
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
If it weren't for you,

416
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
how could he have these resources?

417
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Anyway, tell him

418
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
to keep working hard

419
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
and get closer to it.

420
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
Get closer?

421
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Ji Qing's career is not going to stop now.

422
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Jian Xi wants to surpass him.

423
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
It's only a matter of time.

424
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
It's only a matter of time.

425
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Then why don't you hurry up

426
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
and let us take more photos of your magazine cover?

427
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
So I can borrow more advertising endorsements.

428
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Isn't it just one step closer?

429
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
You are still so picky when you talk.

430
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
Side by side.

431
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Good.

432
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Good.

433
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Nice.

434
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Have a cup of coffee.

435
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
How are we going to arrange it this afternoon?

436
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
We have to go to an interview this afternoon.

437
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
There is still an interview.

438
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
The company's publicity

439
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
thinks you are in the promotion period.

440
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
So they arranged a lot of programs for you.

441
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
If they really want to destroy you,

442
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
it's easy to turn the tide.

443
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
What are you thinking about?

444
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Nothing.

445
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
I just don't understand

446
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
why Qi Wen Sen suddenly arranged so much work for me.

447
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Who cares about him?

448
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
He is not the only boss in the company.

449
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Besides,

450
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
you are developing so well now.

451
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Other directors must value you very much.

452
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
In this way,

453
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
we are on the same page.

454
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Isn't it just a matter of time?

455
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
I hope so.

456
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Don't worry.

457
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
I will carefully select all the programs

458
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
for you.

459
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Jian Xi, you played the role of Chang Fei.

460
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Everyone was very touched.

461
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Thank you.

462
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
I want to ask you.

463
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
In life,

464
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
what kind of person do you like the most?

465
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
I like sincere

466
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
and honest to friends.

467
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
If you like it, say you like it.

468
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
If you don't like it, say you don't like it.

469
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
What kind of person do you hate the most?

470
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
The most hated person

471
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
looks kind on the surface.

472
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
But he is actually a very hypocritical person.

473
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
There are still people asking

474
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
if filming will make you feel very tired.

475
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Have you ever thought about giving up?

476
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
No, not at all.

477
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
I like to perform very much.

478
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
So I will never give up.

479
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
There is also a message here.

480
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,280
What do you think of the fake

481
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,320
and hurtful case of actor Zuo Zuo?

482
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
Now Zuo Zuo's fake and hurtful case

483
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
is a hot media event.

484
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Can you talk about your own opinion?

485
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Jian Xi.

486
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Jian Xi.

487
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
People's eyes will make mistakes.

488
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Don't be too addicted to the appearance.

489
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Otherwise, you will be confused by the illusion.

490
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,320
What does this mean?

491
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,320
I'm not on the scene.

492
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
I haven't seen it with my own eyes.

493
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
So I can't judge it casually.

494
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
You seem to have something in your mind.

495
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Are you lying about Shen Yan in the dark?

496
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
The police will investigate.

497
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
It will give everyone a truth.

498
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
I hope that before the truth comes out,

499
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
everyone will not speculate casually.

500
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
I have heard a lot about

501
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
the rumors about you and Shen Yan.

502
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
For example, fighting for the role.

503
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
Do you hate him very much?

504
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
No.

505
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
I don't hate anyone.

506
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
But you don't have any contact.

507
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
Maybe because everyone is busy with work.

508
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
Shen Yan's mother just died.

509
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Father is now unconscious.

510
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Don't you sympathize with him?

511
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
This is not a question for netizens to ask, right?

512
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
This is the question I want to ask.

513
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
Let's go.

514
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
It's about time.

515
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Let's end today's interview here.

516
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Thank you.

517
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Finally, we can rest for a while.

518
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
That's right.

519
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Jaxi, I have something to tell you.

520
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Long time no see.

521
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Why do you blame Shen Yan for lying?

522
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Shen Yan lied?

523
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Have you forgotten?

524
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
What's wrong?

525
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Take a look yourself.

526
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
How could this be?

527
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
This is just a friend in the middle of nowhere.

528
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Shen Yan's mother just died.

529
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Father is unconscious.

530
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Taiqing is pitiful.

531
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Why are you doing this?

532
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
Kelo is just a fake.

533
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
I believe in my own eyes.

534
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
I also believe that

535
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
others will not wrong you for no reason.

536
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
I have my own principles.

537
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,320
I won't say anything personal in public.

538
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
The interview has been covered.

539
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Why don't you admit it?

540
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Jaxi, you've become so strange.

541
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
I almost don't know you anymore.

542
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
The real person who changed is you.

543
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
You have no sense.

544
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
You were completely taken away by Shen Yan.

545
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
It's not Shen Yan who made me feel bad, but you.

546
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
I regret it.

547
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I regret why I came to you.

548
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
You are not the same Jaxi anymore.

549
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Make it clear.

550
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Forget it.

551
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
Forget what?

552
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
This newspaper is just writing nonsense.

553
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
And that Internet live broadcast.

554
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Why did you blackout?

555
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
I must sue them.

556
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Those who are clean are clean.

557
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Wait a minute.

558
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Jaxi.

559
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
I have heard a lot about you and Shen Yan's rumours.

560
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
For example, fighting over roles.

561
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
You are the one who is the most important person.

562
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Do you hate him?

563
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
You look kind on both sides.

564
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
In fact, you are a very hypocritical person.

565
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
You seem to have something to say.

566
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
Are you lying about Shen Yan?

567
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
People's eyes will be wrong.

568
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Don't be too addicted to the appearance.

569
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Otherwise, you will be confused by the illusion.

570
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Shen Yan's mother just died.

571
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Father is now in a coma.

572
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
Don't you sympathize with him?

573
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
No, not at all.

574
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
How did it become like this?

575
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
I re-edited it.

576
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
What?

577
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,320
From the beginning, the host set a trap for Jaxi.

578
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
He designed the problem.

579
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
He re-edited the answer.

580
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,320
And got the effect they wanted.

581
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,320
In this way, those media will be more confused.

582
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Don't you understand?

583
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Internet live broadcast is the most popular Internet program at present.

584
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Their purpose this time is very clear.

585
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Not only traditional media.

586
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,320
But also inciting the public.

587
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
I'm sorry.

588
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Qianqian.

589
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Thanks.

590
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Yao Yao, thank you for today.

591
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,120
You've worked hard.

592
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,680
Go back and rest.

593
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,560
I'm fine.

594
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,040
I'll stay and stay with you.

595
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,360
I have to go to the hospital.

596
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,160
And...

597
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,720
I want to be with my mom as much as possible.

598
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
But I'm going back. What about you?

599
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,680
It's okay. Don't worry.

600
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,800
Okay. Don't worry.

601
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
I'll handle all the reports for you.

602
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,840
Just stay in the hospital and take care of your dad.

603
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,920
Okay.

604
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,160
I'm leaving.

605
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,360
Chi Yan.

606
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,440
You're here.

607
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,120
Are you okay?

608
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,240
Don't be too sad.

609
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,400
After what happened,

610
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,440
you went to see Jian Xi, right?

611
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,320
Then,

612
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
he must have told you

613
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,200
that I'm a woman with deep and evil heart.

614
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,720
You believed it, right?

615
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,160
Shen Yan, I...

616
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,160
My mom has left.

617
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,040
My dad is in the hospital again.

618
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
You don't believe me now.

619
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,680
I don't know what I did wrong.

620
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,200
What did I do wrong?

621
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,160
God has punished me like this.

622
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,160
I'm so sorry.

623
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,320
What should I do?

624
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,920
I'd rather die.

625
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,600
Shen Yan, it's my fault.

626
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,280
It's all my fault.

627
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,560
Don't leave me, okay?

628
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,320
Can you stay with me?

629
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,120
Don't leave me.

630
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,400
I won't leave you.

631
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,320
Do you believe me?

632
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,240
I'm sad every day.

633
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm scared.

634
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,160
I feel like I'm being stolen

635
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,720
from Jian Xi every day.

636
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,880
He's the one you liked.

637
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,720
I'm so worried

638
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,240
that you'll misunderstand me

639
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,840
because of his words.

640
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,200
Don't worry.

641
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,960
I'll stand by your side.

642
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,800
Thank you.

643
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,560
Thank you, Ke Lu.

644
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,400
Thank you.

645
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,000
Thank you for being with me.

646
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,560
As long as you're with me,

647
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,760
I can give up everything.

648
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,840
I won't fight with him anymore.

649
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,600
I won't fight with him anymore.

650
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,360
I've heard a lot about you and Shen Yan.

651
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,960
For example, they're fighting over the role.

652
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,520
Do you hate him?

653
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,480
He looks kind on the surface.

654
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,080
But he's a hypocrite

655
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,200
on the inside.

656
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,360
You're like a painting.

657
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,880
Don't look at this nonsense.

658
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,920
It'll affect your mood.

659
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,480
Jian Xi, look.

660
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,120
Mi Di, I'm sorry.

661
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,200
Please go out for a while.

662
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,560
I have something to talk to Jian Xi.

663
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,760
Okay.

664
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,880
Thank you.

665
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,280
That's too much.

666
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,960
I called them,

667
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,200
but they ignored me.

668
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,880
They said it was for the show.

669
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,920
It's just a black and white.

670
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,680
That's the key to the problem.

671
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,600
Teacher, why are you here?

672
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,800
Why are you here?

673
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
I'm here to tell you

674
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,280
that you won't be able to

675
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,760
attend the next month's event.

676
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,440
Why?

677
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,000
The whole thing is aimed at you.

678
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,080
Someone wants to use this event

679
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,600
to completely destroy you.

680
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Is it that serious?

681
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,480
Not only the show,

682
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,640
but also the online comments.

683
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Your Weibo

684
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,320
has reached

685
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,480
120,000 comments in 24 hours.

686
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,200
It's very unusual.

687
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,640
I suspect

688
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,960
someone is deliberately inciting online comments.

689
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,520
I'm investigating this matter now.

690
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,400
Before I find out the truth,

691
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,440
I hope you can keep your low profile.

692
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,400
Don't show up in public.

693
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,560
Otherwise,

694
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,000
it will cause unnecessary misunderstandings.

695
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,320
I have no qualms.

696
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
I don't want to stop working

697
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
because of these unnecessary crimes.

698
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,240
Jian Xi, don't be so willful.

699
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,720
I remember the teacher told me

700
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,560
that I can't affect the show

701
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,800
under any circumstances.

702
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,120
This is very unusual.

703
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,600
I have experienced life-threatening attacks.

704
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
This kind of thing

705
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,400
is like a reenactment of the past.

706
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,600
I only said one sentence.

707
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,400
It can't cause a big storm.

708
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,040
And it will soon be calm and quiet.

709
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Jian Xi.

710
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
I have an advertisement to shoot.

711
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,480
I'm leaving first.

712
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,040
Thank you for your kind intention.

713
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
He is quite stubborn.

714
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,800
Look at him closely.

715
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,280
Don't worry.

716
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,960
Shen Yan has lost his mother.

717
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,600
He is so miserable.

718
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,520
You still bully him.

719
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,720
You don't have any sympathy.

720
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,480
Shameless.

721
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,840
You said Shen Yan was hypocritical.

722
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,480
You are hypocritical.

723
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,520
You actually defied Shen Yan.

724
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,360
I advise you.

725
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,440
People are watching.

726
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,320
If you do too much,

727
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
you will be punished by God.

728
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,240
If you don't believe me, look up.

729
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,440
God will forgive you.

730
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,040
I'm relieved to see everyone scolding you.

731
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,240
People are invincible.

732
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,000
Who is this?

733
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,920
A swordman to vent his anger.

734
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,400
Swordman.

735
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Go to see someone.

736
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,640
Swordman.

737
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,920
A swordman.

738
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,760
Swordman.

739
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,120
Swordman.

740
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,080
Go to see someone.

741
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,400
Swordman.

742
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,720
A swordman.

743
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Swordman.

744
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,320
Director.

745
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,680
My god.

746
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,040
What happened to your eyes?

747
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,880
Such big dark circles.

748
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,360
Miss.

749
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,760
Our actor is just a face.

750
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,160
Look at you now.

751
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,080
How can I shoot?

752
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,120
Director.

753
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,880
You can cover it.

754
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,240
Hurry up.

755
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,720
Fix your makeup.

756
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Hurry up.

757
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,760
Have you seen the old comments?

758
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,960
It's so big.

759
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,200
Shen Yan cried.

760
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,480
The whole world sympathizes him.

761
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,040
The actor has arrived.

762
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,720
This one.

763
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,960
He is almost a building.

764
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,520
Liu Zhifeng, please say.

765
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,760
Thousands of comments.

766
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,720
All are scolding.

767
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,680
Yes.

768
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,600
If I say something,

769
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,000
he would have cried to death.

770
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
He even dared to come to shoot.

771
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
How can you compare with him?

772
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,360
Don't worry.

773
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,120
It's okay.

774
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,720
No.

775
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,440
You are still crying.

776
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,800
Say it louder.

777
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,120
I'm afraid others can't hear it.

778
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,160
Forget it.

779
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
No need to draw.

780
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,600
Why?

781
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,160
The factory just canceled the shooting.

782
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,680
Brothers, take it.

783
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,560
We won't shoot today.

784
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,080
Director.

785
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,680
What's the reason?

786
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,040
Give me a reason.

787
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,960
Anxin.

788
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,480
We are old friends.

789
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,120
To be honest,

790
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,000
the factory said

791
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,320
all the online products are bad.

792
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:33,920
Now,

793
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,760
we have to send a promotional poster.

794
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,000
He said it would seriously affect the image of the product.

795
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,920
Sorry.

796
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,000
Forget it.

797
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,440
If our image is damaged

798
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,640
and the advertising company withdraws,

799
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,000
we have to compensate.

800
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,560
I didn't expect the rumors on the Internet to be so bad.

801
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,720
Why are you bleeding?

802
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,040
I'm fine.

803
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,760
What?

804
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,960
You didn't tell me you were hurt.

805
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,360
Let me see.

806
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,640
I'm fine. I've been bandaged.

807
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,040
I don't want to affect the photo shoot.

808
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,880
Go to the hospital.

809
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,240
Anxin.

810
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,560
Go to the hospital.

811
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,080
You are hurt.

812
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,040
Why are you still shooting?

813
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,640
Hurry up.

814
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,200
Go.

815
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,280
I don't want to be a nurse.

816
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,040
Miss Ji.

817
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,000
You can't lie on the bed all the time.

818
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,560
You have to be treated.

819
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,440
I even need to sit on a wheelchair in the sun.

820
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,840
How do you want me to be treated?

821
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,720
Your right leg is just a slight fracture.

822
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,400
It won't affect your walk.

823
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
But if you lie on the bed all the time

824
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,280
and refuse to be treated,

825
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,080
we can't let you leave the hospital.

826
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,840
Who said I was going to leave the hospital?

827
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,720
My leg hasn't recovered yet.

828
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,120
My scar on my face hasn't healed yet.

829
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,520
My leg hasn't recovered yet.

830
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,760
Why should I leave the hospital?

831
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,720
You ungrateful people.

832
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,720
You are irresponsible.

833
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,280
Get out.

834
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,880
Get out.

835
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,560
Do you hear me?

836
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,480
Get out.

837
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,960
Get out.

838
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,480
Get out.

839
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,360
Ji Qing.

840
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
What's going on?

841
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,320
Don't be angry.

842
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,120
Tang Fei.

843
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,920
Tang Fei, you are here.

844
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,600
Sit down.

845
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,360
What's going on?

846
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,600
Why are you so angry?

847
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,440
Mr. Tang.

848
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,000
You should talk to Miss Ji.

849
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,280
We really have no choice.

850
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,800
She is too emotional.

851
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,320
Tang Fei.

852
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,720
Let's change the hospital.

853
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,600
They don't know how to treat patients.

854
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,120
Let's change the hospital immediately.

855
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,560
You can leave now.

856
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,680
Leave this to me.

857
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,040
Let's go.

858
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,600
Ji Qing.

859
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,040
You don't want to be in the play anymore?

860
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,840
I...

861
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,560
If you want to be in the play,

862
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,280
you have to cooperate with the treatment.

863
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,200
I know.

864
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,120
You are worried about your scar.

865
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,200
But since she has a problem,

866
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,600
we have to go to her.

867
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,440
We have to find a way to solve her.

868
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,560
She is lying in bed every day like you.

869
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,280
The problem will never be solved.

870
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,520
I am so scared.

871
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,960
I am really scared.

872
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,120
If my scar can't be healed,

873
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,600
I can't go to the play.

874
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,120
If I can't go to the play,

875
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,480
I would rather stay here for the rest of my life.

876
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,440
I don't want to go out.

877
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,040
They will laugh at me.

878
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,600
I promise you.

879
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,320
I will find the best doctor.

880
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
I will cure your scar.

881
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,200
It won't take long.

882
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,880
You can stand in front of the camera.

883
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,640
But you have to promise me.

884
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,960
You can't always be like this.

885
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,360
You can get angry at me.

886
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,160
It's not good.

887
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,320
Did you hear the doctor?

888
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,120
The scar is almost inflamed.

889
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,880
Don't be lazy.

890
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,160
You have to change the medicine every day.

891
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,640
It's okay.

892
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,120
Don't worry.

893
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,040
You are an actress.

894
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,440
Your image is very important.

895
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,520
You must pay attention.

896
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,920
Okay.

897
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,320
I will tell you

898
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,040
even if I am targeted by mosquitoes.

899
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,760
Okay?

900
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,920
That's more like it.

901
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,080
Okay.

902
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,840
You stay here.

903
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,800
I will go get the medicine.

904
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,600
Okay.

905
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,840
Tang Fei is so handsome.

906
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,880
And he is so polite.

907
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,040
He is just like the rumors.

908
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,560
Yes.

909
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,000
It's so lucky to have such a boyfriend.

910
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,920
I am so lucky.

911
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,960
Yes.

912
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,800
But it's not always the case.

913
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,480
He is a good person when he is happy.

914
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,640
He changes when he mentions the medicine.

915
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
But he has to take medicine every day.

916
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,600
It's so lucky.

917
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,240
Hello.

918
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,120
Here you are.

919
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,920
Thank you.

920
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,680
Where did he go?

921
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,800
Not bad.

922
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,240
It's been seven minutes.

923
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Three more minutes.

924
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,240
Are you okay?

925
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,840
Don't worry.

926
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,200
It's okay.

927
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,120
Take your time.

928
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,080
I will help you.

929
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,720
You saw it, right?

930
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,560
It's you.

931
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,680
How long have you been with Tang Fei?

932
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,080
Half a year.

933
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,440
Three months.

934
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,200
Or maybe a month.

935
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,320
I think it should be a short time.

936
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,080
What do you want to say?

937
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,320
Tang Fei debuted very early.

938
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,080
In front of outsiders,

939
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,360
he is a perfect gentleman.

940
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,200
But I know him.

941
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,280
He doesn't love the glory of an actor.

942
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,680
But the glory of this is the benefit for him.

943
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,360
In other words,

944
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,880
he loves money.

945
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,320
If it's a life-saving thing,

946
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,880
it's not a problem.

947
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,160
So what?

948
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,040
People are emotional animals.

949
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
They are easily confused.

950
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,080
Whether he likes you

951
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,120
from the bottom of his heart

952
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,480
or out of his heart,

953
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
I think he can't

954
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,240
give a clear answer himself.

955
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,360
After this passion is cooled down,

956
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,160
will he choose you?

957
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,600
Whether it's the glory,

958
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,560
family background,

959
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,160
or popularity,

960
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,600
you can't compare with the love.

961
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,640
It's better to see the reality earlier.

962
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
You love love, right?

963
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,240
Am I right?

964
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,200
Don't say that.

965
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,960
Do you think love can be happy

966
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,040
if it hurts me?

967
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Have you ever thought that

968
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,080
if I lost Tang Fei,

969
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,600
you also lost love.

970
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,000
If I'm hurt,

971
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,880
Mr. Qi,

972
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,280
you should be happy too.

973
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,680
Qi Wen Sen,

974
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,400
you've been with Ji Qin for so long,

975
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,680
but you can't make him fall in love with you.

976
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,480
Do you know why?

977
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,680
Princess Snow

978
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,480
only likes Prince White Horse

979
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,440
and doesn't like evil Xie Zi.

980
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,600
A businessman like you

981
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,120
who always frame others in the dark

982
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,800
and are full of hatred all his life

983
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,640
can't get the one he likes.

984
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,680
Love can't be used

985
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,600
for nothing.

986
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,080
Don't always think of manipulating others.

987
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,720
Except yourself,

988
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,440
you can't manipulate anyone.

989
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,920
Yanxi,

990
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,120
if you're really so confident,

991
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,120
why don't you dare to keep looking?

992
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,880
Because you're afraid

993
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,040
that you'll see the truth

994
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,320
and lose Tang Fei.

995
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,000
You're just making false promises.

996
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,840
Don't be too sad

997
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,160
if you didn't get the movie today.

998
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,360
I'll get you a bigger movie.

999
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,880
I'm not unhappy because of these things.

1000
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,360
Then what are you unhappy about?

1001
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,520
You didn't say anything all the way.

1002
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,880
Maybe I'm a little tired.

1003
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,880
Tired?

1004
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
I'm going to get some water.

1005
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,960
Go.

1006
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,560
I'm going to get some water.

1007
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,200
Go.

1008
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,760
Go.

1009
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,360
Go.

1010
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:09,840
Go.

1011
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,320
Go.

1012
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,000
Go.

1013
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,600
Go.

1014
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,200
Go.

1015
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,800
Go.

1016
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,400
Go.

1017
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,880
Go.

1018
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,440
Go.

1019
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,000
Go.

1020
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,600
Go.

1021
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,000
You're the one who's good and good.

1022
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,960
You're the one who's fake.

1023
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,440
Who?

1024
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,200
I've been through three people.

1025
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,960
Let's get out of here.

1026
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,800
Stop it.

1027
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,480
You're so ugly.

1028
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,520
Look at your face.

1029
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,200
You're a actress.

1030
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,280
You should be on the back stage.

1031
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
The camera crew said that she's fake.

1032
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,800
You're the fake one.

1033
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,120
You and Shen Yan are good friends.

1034
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,960
She's so angry.

1035
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,920
You're so happy.

1036
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,800
Are you a human?

1037
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,960
Get out of here.

1038
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,720
Get out.

1039
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,360
This is a misunderstanding.

1040
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,160
I never criticized her.

1041
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,520
Since you're her fans,

1042
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,440
you should be more rational

1043
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,680
and protect your idol.

1044
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,520
She's a witch.

1045
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:41,920
Come here.

1046
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,720
You're the one who's fake.

1047
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,320
Come here.

1048
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,200
Jian Xi.

1049
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,200
Jian Xi.

1050
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,600
Jian Xi, are you okay?

1051
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,040
Don't be afraid.

1052
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,360
It's okay.

1053
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,120
It's okay.

1054
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,000
It's okay.

1055
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,520
It's okay.

1056
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,120
It's okay.

1057
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,120
Don't be afraid.

1058
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,320
It's okay.

1059
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,120
It's okay.

1060
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,800
Jian Xi.

1061
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,960
You've been in there for half an hour.

1062
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,880
Are you okay?

1063
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,360
I'm fine.

1064
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,160
Come here. Let me see.

1065
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,960
Did you touch the water?

1066
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,280
Are you okay?

1067
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,240
I'm fine.

1068
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,560
Why are you so nervous?

1069
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,040
I'm thinking

1070
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
I should be more alert next time.

1071
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,720
Who would think

1072
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,480
they would meet those crazy fans?

1073
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,280
I've never met them before.

1074
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,400
But they're so bad.

1075
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,160
All right.

1076
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,400
Don't worry about me.

1077
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,040
You've been tired all day.

1078
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,280
Go back and rest.

1079
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm not going back.

1080
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,960
I'll stay here and watch you.

1081
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,720
I'm going to sleep.

1082
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,400
Go to sleep. I'll watch you.

1083
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,320
You're here.

1084
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,520
You're so confused.

1085
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,600
How can I sleep?

1086
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,120
I'm confused.

1087
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,400
You're always confused, okay?

1088
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,520
Maybe I'm too tired.

1089
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,680
All right.

1090
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,120
Really.

1091
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,960
You're really tired.

1092
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,160
Go back and rest.

1093
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,560
I'll go back first.

1094
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,960
Call me if you need anything.

1095
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
I'm leaving.

1096
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,520
Call me.

1097
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,000
Okay.

1098
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,880
Don't worry.

1099
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,840
Don't touch the cold water.

1100
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,080
I'm leaving.

1101
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:42,960
Tang Fei.

1102
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,560
Tang Fei.

1103
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:45,960
We're here.

1104
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,600
Tomorrow morning at 5 a.m.

1105
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,920
Tang Fei.

1106
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,480
What's up?

1107
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,760
Well...

1108
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,520
Don't be so hasty.

1109
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,080
Tell me.

1110
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,480
This morning,

1111
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,440
Jianxi was attacked

1112
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,680
by those fans at the company gate.

1113
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1114
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,280
You've been so busy these days.

1115
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,360
I'm afraid you'll be anxious.

1116
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,840
I told you I'd be anxious.

1117
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,720
The rain in the night falls on the flowers.

1118
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,720
The moonlight shines on me tonight.

1119
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,800
It's a long journey with loneliness.

1120
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,000
I watch the flowers bloom.

1121
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,840
I watch loneliness disappear.

1122
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,200
I watch the tide rise and fall.

1123
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,760
I'm cold and cold.

1124
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,160
It's dark and bright.

1125
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,520
There's too much hope.

1126
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,600
I get desperate at the end.

1127
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,520
I watch you come and go.

1128
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,040
I hold on to the wind and frost.

1129
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,520
Everything is in a trance.

1130
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,880
I'm stubborn and young.

1131
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,760
It's absurd that I don't forget the past.

1132
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,880
I look back and think of the past.

1133
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:49,520
You and I are getting lost on the road.

1134
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,240
The typhoon doesn't think about anything.

1135
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,200
Where will the new red sea be?

1136
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,520
Just wait for the dawn to come.

1137
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,680
Just wait for the daybreak to come.

1138
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:21,840
Just wait for the daybreak to come.
