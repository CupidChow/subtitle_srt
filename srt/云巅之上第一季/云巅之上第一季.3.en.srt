1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,960
Look at me with strange eyes

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,840
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't want

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't care who is more gentle

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, in the second year

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will be a magical eye

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,800
Pass through the loneliness to find you

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Hold the weapon in your hand

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,760
Use all your strength to fight for the most real you

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,360
No matter what the little tricks

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what rumors

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,960
I will definitely be invincible

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't care if you are willing

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Where is the gold?

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,320
In the past, I kept the sweetness

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,600
No matter where your heart is

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
My heart is here

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
Even if the iron armor is invincible

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm only one you

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Episode 2

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
Director Fu, please

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
Give me a role

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,440
Any role is fine

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,640
You are now a fable

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,520
You are a popular character

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,040
How dare you use you

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,240
I know you are difficult

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,360
But any role is fine

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,800
You can not show your face

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
No, no, really no

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
Director Fu, director, director, hurry up

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,280
Director Fu, I beg you

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
Just give me a role

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,360
Don't let him in

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,880
You can't go in

42
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,080
Everyone, get ready to go in

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,560
Oh yes

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,360
Everyone

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
Is the movie ready?

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,440
Hurry up

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
Ready, three, two, one, action

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,960
What are you doing?

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,040
Sorry

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,320
Can't you see?

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,480
Let me help you

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,040
Don't touch me

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,000
You are dead

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,560
Emotion

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,680
How could it be him?

56
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,280
Are you getting in the car or not?

57
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
He kicked me just now

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
What's wrong with kicking you?

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,120
I'll help you lose some weight

60
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,040
Go, go, don't care about him

61
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,320
You are so beautiful

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,800
OK

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
Sister, please

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,240
I'll use this lens at the end

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,360
Remember it

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,640
It's okay

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,600
The memory is not bad

68
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,360
Here

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,720
Come, get ready for the next scene

70
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,680
Hurry up

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,320
I finally found you

72
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,080
What are you thinking about?

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,240
Look at the plot

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,240
Why is he

75
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,640
Is it a big eye?

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,440
This time he plays

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
The fat girl in the dream love

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,720
Not only you are surprised

79
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
The whole industry is shocked

80
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,600
The last time I played the female ball

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,720
It's already great

82
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
This character

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,560
It's really special

84
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,800
The dream love scene

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,320
22 scenes, 7 scenes, 1 time

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,520
Action

87
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,280
Look

88
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,640
How could he fall down?

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,600
He is too fat

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,760
I understand him

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,360
What do you mean?

92
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,200
As a female actor

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
Want to try different roles

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,600
The plot has been challenging itself

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,960
To complete the actor's strength

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
He is making greater progress

97
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
I can't catch up with him

98
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,640
What do you want?

99
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,320
I want to act

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,320
But now

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,400
I even stand in front of the camera

102
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,200
The freedom

103
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
I can't get it

104
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,520
I can't get it

105
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,640
I can't get it

106
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,680
I can't get it

107
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,640
I can't get it

108
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,840
I can't get it

109
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,880
I don't even have the qualifications

110
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,920
To be in front of the camera

111
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
So you have to invite me

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
To be your agent

113
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,880
Although now

114
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,600
You have been removed

115
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,040
From the charge of attacking Shen Yan

116
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
But in the eyes of the audience

117
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,800
Your image has been buried

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,240
If you want to turn over

119
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,680
Must receive good works

120
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,480
But who will give you

121
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,520
Such an opportunity?

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
I can

123
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,640
you

124
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,480
What does the agent do?

125
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,080
Just to push your actor

126
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,040
Out of the play

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,040
If you invite me to be your agent

128
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
I will definitely introduce you

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,200
Good works

130
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,160
It's better than you alone

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,200
Like a headless fly

132
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,560
To go around and make a good turn, right?

133
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,840
But I

134
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,040
Can you write a play yourself?

135
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,560
Can you talk about the contract yourself?

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,680
You can't

137
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,440
If you refuse me

138
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,960
You will regret it

139
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
What you need is a professional plan

140
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
Can you really help me?

141
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
That's it

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,240
As long as there is a chance to work

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,840
No matter the size of the role

144
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,040
I am willing to act

145
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,440
I also have a small request

146
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,200
For an actor

147
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,440
Any opportunity is not a small thing

148
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,240
So you will have to obey my arrangements in the future

149
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,280
Can you do it?

150
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,200
I promise you

151
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,880
Do not worry

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
With me

153
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,360
I will work hard to get you

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,480
The best case

155
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,640
One day

156
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
I want to surpass them

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
You are here, producer Liu

158
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,200
The floor in this room feels wrong

159
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,240
Change it all

160
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,080
Are you kidding me?

161
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,360
It's all done here

162
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,480
The base is done here

163
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,240
Now I said no, it's a big loss

164
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,680
Since we are going to shoot a play

165
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
We must do the play well

166
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,600
But

167
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
You are here, you are not only wasting money

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,760
You even waste time

169
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,040
Go quickly

170
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,920
OK

171
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,160
Don't move, change the floor

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,440
Don't move

173
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,160
You guys

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,120
Go and clean up the floor inside

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,760
It's me

176
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
Long time no see

177
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,760
Introduce me to the new actor

178
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,960
OK

179
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
Jian Xi

180
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,240
This name sounds familiar

181
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,760
OK

182
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,960
Let's talk when we meet

183
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,480
Producer Liu

184
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,480
Shen Yan

185
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,000
Producer Liu

186
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,600
You are the heroine of my movie

187
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,720
Of course I am grateful to you

188
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,000
So I bought your favorite roasted duck

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,960
Try it while it's hot

190
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,400
You are too kind, thank you

191
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,600
Liu

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,640
Producer Liu

193
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,360
Just now

194
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,000
I heard it there

195
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
You mentioned Jian Xi on the phone

196
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,160
Do you know each other?

197
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,760
Your lemon water

198
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,400
Thank you

199
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,280
Anxin

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,160
What's wrong?

201
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,440
Do you think I can do this?

202
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Why are you so nervous?

203
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,400
I'm afraid that producer Liu

204
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
What if he thinks I'm not good

205
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,120
And he doesn't want to give me that chance

206
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,920
What should I do?

207
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,280
How is that possible?

208
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
He is a good friend of mine for many years

209
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
And he takes care of the newcomers

210
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,520
The most important thing is that he values the strength of the actors

211
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,040
So don't worry

212
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,640
What about my bad side?

213
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,240
What's there to worry about?

214
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,360
In this world

215
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,960
Many people are wise

216
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,640
Not everyone is a man

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,240
So you should relax now

218
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,880
Be natural

219
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,240
Keep the best state and wait for him

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,720
Ok?

221
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,600
Thank you

222
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,160
Thank you for what?

223
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,040
Believe me

224
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
Sorry

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm late

226
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,800
We are not waiting for you

227
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,480
You are waiting for producer Liu

228
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,880
Sorry, he won't come

229
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,160
What are you talking about?

230
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,840
He is so busy

231
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,520
How can he have time to meet a little actor?

232
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,200
It's not your turn

233
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
To meet us

234
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,440
I'm here for a good cause

235
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,880
To see my old friend

236
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,080
No one wants to see you

237
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,040
Just go

238
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
What's wrong?

239
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,320
Before I spill the water on your face

240
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,200
Just go

241
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Why are you so excited?

242
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,480
Because you lost to me?

243
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,880
Little girl

244
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,640
What do you want?

245
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,480
I'm going to perform

246
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,640
My 21st soul class female lead

247
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,040
There are some small roles in the play

248
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
If you go to the door and beg

249
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,720
Not necessarily

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
But if I help you to compete

251
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
The effect is different

252
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,040
What?

253
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,960
You dare not accept it?

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,280
I understand

255
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,600
If you play my movie

256
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
The media will be noisy again

257
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,240
Your previous scandals

258
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,800
Will be re-released overnight

259
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,960
Why do you have to suffer?

260
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
Just quit

261
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,000
What role?

262
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
What role can you help me to win?

263
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,040
No matter what role

264
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,400
We don't need

265
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
He said I have no job

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,960
This is the truth

267
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
I admit

268
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
If you can help me to win the role

269
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,880
I can

270
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
Are you begging me?

271
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,720
Don't say I didn't give you a chance

272
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,240
You kneel down

273
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,920
I will agree

274
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,360
Little girl

275
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
Why are you so angry?

276
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,240
Can't do it

277
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
So firm

278
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,960
Obviously can't do it

279
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,640
You know

280
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,800
I never like people who don't say anything

281
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,800
Jianxi, you get up

282
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,560
Please give me a chance

283
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
Help me to win a role

284
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,160
Regret it?

285
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,120
Or are you afraid?

286
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,600
What am I afraid of?

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,360
Afraid of me to appear on the set

288
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,720
Afraid of me to take away

289
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,000
You finally get everything

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,040
You can get

291
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,280
You were just my company

292
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,960
Everyone only paid attention to me

293
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Are you afraid of this scene?

294
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,240
You are just a small role

295
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
I am the heroine

296
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,600
Ok

297
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,040
You have this confidence

298
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,240
What are you afraid of?

299
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,760
You just said

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,520
You will help me to win a role

301
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
I also want to get this chance

302
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,640
And

303
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,040
I will tell the media

304
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
My good friend Shen Yan

305
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,480
No matter what

306
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,760
Help me to win

307
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,080
I will help you

308
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,400
I really admire you sometimes

309
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,440
I don't like acting

310
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
I only like money and land

311
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,800
And you

312
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
Really like acting

313
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,240
Know what will happen in my play

314
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
You dare to come

315
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
No matter whether it is Daoshan or Huohai

316
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
Just give me a role

317
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,160
I dare to go

318
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,280
I will help you to get a chance to show off

319
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,720
You are so expensive

320
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,920
How can you give the role a chance to show off?

321
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,880
You don't want to go?

322
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,600
Ok

323
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,400
Anyway, there are many people who want to be in Liu Tao's play

324
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,280
I will go

325
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,200
Jianxi

326
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
Just the heroine's sister

327
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,000
See you later

328
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,080
Jianxi, get up

329
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,880
Why are you so mean to yourself?

330
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,840
Anxin

331
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,000
How is your relationship?

332
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,840
What do you mean?

333
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,200
You told me

334
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,600
You are the best agent in the industry

335
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,240
But half a month has passed

336
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,920
I didn't get a job

337
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,360
Don't get me wrong

338
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,040
I am not doubting your ability

339
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,640
I want to tell you

340
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
How bad my situation is now

341
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
I don't want to give up any chance

342
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
Even if it comes from the humiliation of the enemy

343
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
You can't be so wronged

344
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,400
Can't you see it?

345
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
That girl is not kind

346
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,000
And I know

347
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
The role of that sister has been set long ago

348
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,480
As long as you can show off

349
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,920
It's a chance

350
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,480
Jianxi

351
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,080
I think sometimes

352
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
I really don't understand what you are thinking

353
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,760
One day

354
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,160
She will be in pain because of this opportunity

355
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,520
My divorce 21st class

356
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,440
Is the latest film of Liu Tao

357
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
It's about the story of the young girl Changfei

358
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,160
Changfei liked painting since childhood

359
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,320
But she has muscle weakness

360
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,360
Side-phobia

361
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,520
Gradually lost the ability to move

362
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
You are going to play Changfei's sister Changran

363
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,960
Because of the sister who takes care of the sick all year round

364
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,840
Can't stand it

365
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,760
So I want to end Changfei's life

366
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
Is this role too vicious?

367
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,760
No role can't win

368
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,200
I will try my best

369
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,480
Jianxi

370
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Teacher

371
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,040
I thought you

372
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,800
I can be your teacher again

373
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,960
Until you become the best actor

374
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,200
But there is one condition

375
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,640
You must win this heroine from Shen Yan's hands

376
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,080
Lu Zhou

377
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,840
Are you kidding?

378
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,280
How is this possible?

379
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,960
Just because it's impossible

380
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,240
It's challenging

381
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,080
What you can get

382
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,520
Are you interested?

383
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,800
Jianxi

384
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,400
Can you do it?

385
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,920
I can do it

386
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,880
Ok

387
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,640
It's all on you this time

388
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,720
I'm waiting for your result

389
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,000
Jianxi

390
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,760
Do you know what you are talking about?

391
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,880
Anxin

392
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,000
Let's try it

393
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,440
Steal her role

394
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,440
But the role has been decided

395
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,280
I kneeled for her

396
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,920
I really want her to ruin her life

397
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,520
Can you do it?

398
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
The teacher said there will be a chance

399
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,040
Even one-thousandth of it

400
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,000
I have to catch her

401
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,280
Anxin

402
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,560
Can you help me?

403
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,080
As long as you want

404
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
I will do my best to help you

405
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,520
You help me find the information of the ALS patient

406
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,480
I want to see

407
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,600
This dinner tonight

408
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,520
Let's celebrate in advance

409
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,560
Then I will try my best

410
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
After this is done

411
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,520
I will treat you to a big meal

412
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
That's what I mean

413
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,840
Yuele

414
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Did Jianxi and Anxin go there just now?

415
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,240
You mean meatball?

416
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,240
You don't know

417
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,000
She left Zhanmei

418
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,440
Became Jianxi's agent

419
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,200
Always trying to find a better role for Jianxi

420
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,120
You really see the ghost

421
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,040
Do you feel strange?

422
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,840
Now Zhanmei's career is like a day

423
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
Anxin is so smart

424
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,760
Why would she suddenly come to help a little actor

425
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Who is not well-known?

426
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,920
I don't understand

427
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,680
I think this meatball

428
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,960
Must be the wrong medicine

429
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
She has a ghost idea

430
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,040
A person who never knows

431
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,920
Tang Fei

432
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,960
Tang Fei

433
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,160
Her illness at this time

434
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,520
It's already very, very serious

435
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,040
And her hands can't lift

436
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,920
I help you check

437
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,200
Her and her sister's lines

438
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,400
How many times have I told you

439
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,840
Don't drink water

440
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Are you forcing me to change the bed sheet for you at night?

441
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,560
Sister

442
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,200
Sister

443
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,640
Why didn't you close the door?

444
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,960
I remember I closed the door

445
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,400
Why are you here?

446
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,440
You are really in

447
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,440
Just chatting

448
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,480
What's the word?

449
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,520
See people

450
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,000
Please don't say it out

451
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,640
I beg you

452
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,600
I said this

453
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,640
I have no problem

454
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,480
But I just feel

455
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,920
Not like

456
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
I think it's pretty good

457
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,480
From head to toe

458
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,080
How is it possible

459
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,040
I have been to the hospital

460
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,480
I have visited this patient

461
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,320
You must not tell others that you have visited

462
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
You have also observed

463
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,080
You say you look like this

464
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,160
How can you compete with Miss Shen?

465
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,440
How do you know

466
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
Of course I know

467
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,080
Liu Tao is going to plan

468
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,840
About the story of ALS patient

469
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,680
She wants to find Shen Yan to be the female number one

470
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,280
People in the circle have spread

471
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,920
It seems that you are in danger this time

472
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,560
Why am I acting bad?

473
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,840
Are you confident?

474
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,280
Ok

475
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,160
You just imagine

476
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,200
You are ALS patient

477
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,800
What?

478
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
Why are you staring at me?

479
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,680
You are now numb

480
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,160
You don't even have the strength to speak

481
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,600
So when I touch you

482
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,480
You should

483
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,720
Got it

484
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,520
Again

485
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,600
Three two one

486
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,680
You even hold my hand

487
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,600
It's quite agile

488
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:20,960
Again

489
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,600
Three two one

490
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,400
Why are you hiding?

491
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,800
I

492
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,920
Actually

493
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,440
You are wrong in every way

494
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,800
Because a real late ALS patient

495
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,520
Is not likely to sit by the bed like you

496
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,120
Of course

497
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,160
What I said

498
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
Is just an external form of magic

499
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,400
But it's useless

500
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,040
Because if you want to win Shen Yan

501
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,200
You must have more thoughts on this character

502
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,440
For example

503
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,920
Your mental journey after the illness

504
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,120
As far as I know

505
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,960
Normal ALS patients

506
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,280
When they know they are sick

507
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,800
They are very scared

508
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,400
They are looking for a doctor

509
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
Want to struggle with fate

510
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,120
Because they don't want to die

511
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,960
But slowly

512
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,320
They are tortured by the illness

513
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,320
They really can't hold on

514
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,080
Then they will find out

515
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,840
The most painful thing every day

516
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,080
Is not death

517
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,920
But to live

518
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,480
Living is the most painful thing for them

519
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,000
Ok

520
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,680
You are finally alive

521
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,360
Why?

522
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,160
There must be a reason

523
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,960
Then you have to understand through the script

524
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,920
At this time

525
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,600
What is his psychological burden?

526
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,040
What is his biggest hope?

527
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,960
Is it a career or a person?

528
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,200
You can think more

529
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,760
Before he got sick

530
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,920
What kind of person is he?

531
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,640
What personality?

532
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,000
What education?

533
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,040
What family environment?

534
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,080
What characteristics does he have?

535
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
So when he changed to ALS

536
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,520
Facing the same thing

537
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,200
What is his different attitude and performance

538
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,360
From other ALS patients?

539
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
I know he can't understand

540
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,800
I'm talking so much nonsense

541
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,680
Who said

542
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,080
As long as I have time to practice

543
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,080
I can

544
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,760
I hope so

545
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,840
And Anxin

546
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,160
Can you shoot it?

547
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
Don't take the script all day

548
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
You will kill him

549
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,520
I'm leaving

550
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,920
Jinxi

551
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,000
If you are sleepy, go to bed early

552
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,720
Don't think too much

553
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,200
I'll leave the script here

554
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,240
Take a look if you want to see it

555
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,280
And

556
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,680
I think Tang Fei is right

557
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,440
Go to bed early

558
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,520
I can do it

559
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,800
I can definitely do it

560
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,040
This Jinxi is too hard

561
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Does she really want to get this role?

562
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,600
Every actor wants a good role

563
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
But can she get it?

564
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,120
It depends on her ability

565
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,080
I think so

566
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,040
I think so

567
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,000
I think so

568
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,960
I think so

569
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,240
I think so

570
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,520
I think so

571
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,640
I think so

572
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,840
I think so

573
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,800
I think so

574
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,840
I think so

575
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,640
I think so

576
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,520
I think so

577
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,560
I think so

578
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,600
I think so

579
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,560
I think so

580
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,760
What are you looking at?

581
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,760
My stomach is a little hot

582
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,560
I'll go back first

583
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,880
Meatball

584
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,760
I really want to interview you

585
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,040
How can you be willing to leave

586
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,960
A rock-cutting tree like Zhanmei

587
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,000
I came here

588
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,680
Are you my shadow?

589
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,280
Follow me every day

590
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,120
I'm thinking about you, okay?

591
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,920
Do you understand?

592
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,800
I need you to think about me

593
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,280
Listen well

594
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,040
I will definitely make our Jinxi

595
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,720
The most famous actress

596
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,280
OK

597
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,720
More than Tang Fei

598
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,080
what

599
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,080
I didn't hear wrong

600
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,120
Next life you

601
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,560
Then compare

602
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,240
What if you lose me

603
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,200
If I lose

604
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,120
I kneel down and kowtow to you

605
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,840
What about you

606
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,520
Deal

607
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,560
OK

608
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm here

609
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,040
I know some things.

610
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,240
I'm good at acting!

611
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,360
roasted bean paste

612
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,880
Please go check over the eating area first advertisement…

613
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,560
What, you, who has been properly adjusted already?

614
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,920
See what I just told you about.

615
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,440
Now you've finally changed!

616
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,240
You already know?

617
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Why is it so heavy?

618
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,600
What are you tying? Let me see.

619
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,720
You're right.

620
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,080
If you don't experience it,

621
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,800
you won't know

622
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,040
what it feels like

623
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,240
to be so heavy.

624
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,080
I don't know what you're doing.

625
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,480
I really don't understand.

626
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,680
If the result of life is death,

627
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
why should we still face it with a smile?

628
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,400
Instead of living in pain,

629
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,040
it's better to die.

630
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
I really want to know how he feels.

631
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,920
Okay, I understand. Come on.

632
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,320
You want to know, right?

633
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,800
Okay, you can take your time.

634
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,440
I don't care about you.

635
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,480
I want to take a day off from you.

636
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,640
I want to practice more.

637
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,000
Can you do that?

638
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,560
Thank you.

639
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,120
I'll do it.

640
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,840
Chang Fei has loved painting since he was a kid.

641
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,680
Even if he can't move his hands and feet,

642
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,240
he still tried his best to complete this painting.

643
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,120
Ice and fire.

644
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,640
Right.

645
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,480
The designer of ALS

646
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,880
used his own power

647
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,120
to complete this movie poster.

648
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,120
This is the original shape of the movie.

649
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,760
Pure ice burns the fire.

650
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,960
I really don't understand what this painting means.

651
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,240
Don't think too much.

652
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,960
Try it.

653
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,200
The Zero唉.

654
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,200
Too many Alas.

655
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,560
Wait a minute.

656
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,320
Did you get the completeコ?

657
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,640
It seems

658
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,320
you haven't really

659
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,720
I want to tell you,

660
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
to understand the character's actions

661
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,520
is just the most obvious performance technique.

662
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,720
If you want to get the role from Shen Yan,

663
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,720
you must let yourself completely become Chang Fei

664
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,020
and have his soul to move the producer.

665
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,120
Understand?

666
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,920
His soul?

667
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,320
I really want to know his feelings.

668
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,620
Why did he draw such strange pictures?

669
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,920
And he was rejected so many times,

670
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
and he still lived so stubbornly.

671
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,720
Qian Xi, if you want to know the real Chang Fei,

672
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,520
first, give up on yourself.

673
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,920
Put yourself in the same situation as him.

674
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,120
Give up on myself?

675
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,520
Yes.

676
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,920
How about this?

677
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,120
I'll help you find Chang Fei.

678
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,520
Come with me.

679
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,520
Go in.

680
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,120
If you want to get the role of Chang Fei,

681
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,720
listen to me.

682
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,120
Go in.

683
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,720
What do you want to do?

684
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,920
Qian Xi!

685
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,120
Qian Xi!

686
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,120
This is a wine cellar with red wine.

687
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,320
The ideal temperature of the wine is 10 to 14 degrees.

688
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,320
This temperature can't let you experience the real coldness.

689
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,320
Now it's below zero, 14 degrees.

690
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,720
Only at this temperature

691
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,120
can you really experience what is coldness.

692
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Think about Chang Fei's feelings.

693
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,920
Go and experience his feelings.

694
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,520
Don't think about his acting.

695
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,120
Experience his feelings.

696
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Stop! What are you doing?

697
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,120
Are you crazy?

698
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,320
Do you know how serious this is?

699
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
I can't let him go crazy with you.

700
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
If you're doing this for his own good,

701
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,920
then don't cause trouble.

702
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,120
Don't think I don't know.

703
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,320
You want to leave all your unfulfilled wishes

704
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,520
to Qian Xi.

705
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,920
You've been ruined.

706
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Do you want to take her with you to die?

707
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,720
Shut up!

708
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,320
I told you to be her agent.

709
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
I didn't tell you to interfere with my business.

710
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,920
Get lost!

711
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,720
You're a lunatic!

712
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
Tang Fei.

713
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,520
Aren't you filming in the crew?

714
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
Why are you back in the company?

715
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,520
My Ji Qing wants to see someone.

716
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
Don't talk nonsense.

717
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Who's talking nonsense?

718
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
Who told you to go back to the company?

719
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,920
Xiao Xiao.

720
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,720
You guys talk. We won't bother you.

721
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,520
Let's go.

722
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,320
What are you doing?

723
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
I have something to do.

724
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,720
Two light bulbs are there.

725
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,520
How can my Ji Qing talk?

726
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,320
Stop it. I have work to do.

727
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,120
Then we can chat.

728
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,320
What are we chatting about?

729
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,120
There's a lot to chat about.

730
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,920
Brother Yue.

731
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,720
I have a lot to tell you.

732
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
I...

733
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:23,920
Tang Fei.

734
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Why are you here?

735
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,120
I don't have time to bother you.

736
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,720
I have something urgent.

737
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,320
Don't come over.

738
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,920
Tang Fei.

739
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,120
Something happened to Qian Xi.

740
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,520
What happened to Qian Xi?

741
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,720
She was locked up in the cellar.

742
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,520
I'm so tired.

743
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,120
I'm really tired.

744
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,120
My body can't balance anymore.

745
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
My whole body seems to be frozen.

746
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
My fingers can't stretch.

747
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,520
I'm so scared.

748
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,720
I'm really scared.

749
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Even if I persist,

750
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
how long can I live?

751
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,720
Mom.

752
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,320
I want to buy a flower book.

753
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,920
Do I have to

754
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,520
take off my last hobby?

755
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,920
I...

756
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,120
Do I really have to leave this world?

757
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,920
Even if my whole body is frozen,

758
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,520
my heart is still beating.

759
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,920
I want to live.

760
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,720
Mom.

761
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,120
I want to live.

762
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,120
Mom.

763
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,720
Tang Fei.

764
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,120
Open the door.

765
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,520
What are you doing?

766
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Open the door.

767
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,720
What are you doing? I'm doing it for her.

768
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,120
Go away.

769
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,320
Go away.

770
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,920
Qian Xi.

771
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
What happened?

772
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,320
Why is Qian Xi locked up in the cellar?

773
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Why did you do that?

774
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Why did I do that?

775
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,520
Even if people all over the world

776
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,120
think I'm crazy,

777
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,320
as an actress,

778
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,320
you should know

779
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,120
I understand.

780
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,720
What is she talking about?

781
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,520
What does she understand?

782
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,120
She understands

783
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,320
what Qian Xi did.

784
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,920
I don't understand.

785
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,520
She got the most sincere experience.

786
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,520
Hurry.

787
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
Go to the nearest hospital.

788
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,520
I can't go.

789
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
If someone takes a picture of her,

790
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,320
it will be troublesome.

791
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
She's in such a serious condition.

792
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,920
Let's go to the hospital.

793
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,520
Go home.

794
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,120
Go home, master.

795
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,920
Yes, master.

796
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,520
Please hurry up.

797
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,720
Tang Fei, the water is ready.

798
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,320
Go away.

799
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,920
It's okay.

800
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,920
It's okay.

801
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,720
Sit tight.

802
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
It's okay.

803
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Qian Xi, it's okay.

804
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,320
Where is the water?

805
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Why are you standing there? Hurry up.

806
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
It's okay.

807
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Your clothes are ready.

808
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,320
Do you feel warmer?

809
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,920
Qian Xi.

810
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Almost done.

811
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,320
It's done.

812
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,520
Are you blind?

813
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,520
I was just panicking.

814
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,920
It's done.

815
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,320
Qian Xi, wake up.

816
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,920
Coming.

817
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Qian Xi, drink some milk.

818
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,120
Here.

819
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,320
Drink more milk.

820
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,520
Drink some milk.

821
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,920
Here, drink slowly.

822
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,120
Drink slowly.

823
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,720
Here.

824
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,120
How is it?

825
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,920
Are you feeling better?

826
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,720
How is it?

827
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,920
That's not a fire.

828
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
That's my heart.

829
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,520
My heart is beating in the ice.

830
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,320
What are you saying?

831
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,520
Even if my whole body is frozen,

832
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,120
I still want to live.

833
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,720
I'm frozen.

834
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,720
I can keep Chang Fei.

835
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,320
Are you an idiot?

836
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,120
For a role,

837
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,120
you lost your life.

838
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,920
Is it worth it?

839
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,120
Do you know you almost died just now?

840
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,320
If I had taken a step back,

841
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,720
you would have been frozen to death there.

842
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,520
Did Lu Zhou tell you to do that?

843
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,320
Did he?

844
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,120
He is my teacher.

845
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,920
Did you die because of him?

846
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,120
It's over, it's over.

847
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,920
How come I have to do it again?

848
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,320
I only hadpy to win겠다.

849
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,720
Does he have feelings for me now?

850
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,200
I do you feel hurt after I lose this man,

851
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,920
don't you?

852
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,320
But I also returned him this future.

853
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
big'Mo,

854
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
it's over.

855
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,720
what about it

856
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,920
Stop acting. You're already like this.

857
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,120
What are you talking about?

858
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,720
Are you feeling unwell?

859
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,120
Why are you sitting here in this wind?

860
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,520
There's no moon tonight.

861
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,320
Are you angry?

862
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,920
How could I be angry for you?

863
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,320
I'm sorry.

864
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,320
Today, you all were worried about me.

865
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,120
Anxin told me that you saved me.

866
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,920
What?

867
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,320
Don't think that I'm trying so hard to be the leading actress.

868
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,520
I also acted in the movie,

869
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,720
The Poor Little Girl, which was bullied by the landlord.

870
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,320
This time, I really want to act in this movie.

871
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,120
Why?

872
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,520
Because it's a story about the person who's moving.

873
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,720
I hope that more people will see and pay attention to this group.

874
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,120
A sugar cane blocks the car. It's not like you're strong.

875
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,520
The power of the movie is endless.

876
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
When the movie was aired,

877
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,920
more people started to pay attention to it.

878
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,320
And there aren't many people who know about ALS.

879
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,320
I hope that through the power of the movie,

880
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,120
more people will know and understand this group.

881
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,720
After all, more people know and more power.

882
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,720
What you're saying is a great thing.

883
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,920
Leave such great things to those great people.

884
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,320
A little actress like us,

885
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,520
we can't understand.

886
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,320
What?

887
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,920
That's what I really think.

888
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,920
That's why I really want to act in this movie, no matter what role.

889
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,720
What's this?

890
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,920
This is from Anxin. It's delicious.

891
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,720
It looks good.

892
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,720
No!

893
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,920
This is mine! I won't give it to you.

894
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Try it.

895
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,120
No! Give it to me!

896
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,920
Try it.

897
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,120
I'm very hungry!

898
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Come on.

899
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,120
How can you grab food from me?

900
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Give it back to me!

901
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Why did you eat it?

902
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
It's not good.

903
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,120
I don't believe you. I want to eat it.

904
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,120
This is mine! Spit it out!

905
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,120
Spit it out!

906
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,120
Spit it out!

907
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
What's wrong?

908
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,120
What's wrong?

909
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Tang Fei?

910
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,120
Tang Fei!

911
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Tang Fei, what's wrong?

912
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Are you okay?

913
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Tang Fei! Did you choke?

914
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Tang Fei, are you okay?

915
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Ke Lu.

916
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,120
I just came back from the foreign trade.

917
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,120
I heard about you, so I rushed over.

918
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
About me?

919
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,120
I was the one who misled you.

920
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,120
You never attacked Shen Yan.

921
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
I'm sorry.

922
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
Please forgive me.

923
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
I'm not angry anymore.

924
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,120
Although you suspected me at first, I was a little angry.

925
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,120
No, I should say

926
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,120
I was so angry that I couldn't breathe.

927
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,120
But now I'm fine.

928
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
You're really not angry anymore?

929
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Yes.

930
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,120
And through this,

931
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,120
I understand my own feelings.

932
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,120
What feelings?

933
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
In my heart,

934
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
you're always just a good friend.

935
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,120
Although I had feelings at first,

936
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,120
I believe that it's not love.

937
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Could it be... could it be because...

938
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,120
If I really like you,

939
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,120
I shouldn't just be angry.

940
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,120
Although I'm not smart,

941
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
and I've never been in love,

942
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,120
but then I thought

943
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,120
true love shouldn't be this kind of feeling.

944
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Jian Xi.

945
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Ke Lu.

946
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,120
Thank you for always being by my side.

947
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,120
I hope we can continue to be good friends.

948
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,120
I'm the first person to act.

949
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,120
You don't need a girl like that, do you?

950
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
Go back.

951
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,120
Go back.

952
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,120
Go back.

953
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Hello.

954
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Why are you peeking at me?

955
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,120
Didn't you see that I'm exercising?

956
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,120
I don't have time to peek at you.

957
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,120
You were peeking at me from the gap.

958
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,120
I ate too much sandwich for dinner.

959
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,120
So I have to exercise.

960
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,120
So that I can digest.

961
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,120
What did you see?

962
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,120
What did you hear?

963
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,120
Tell me.

964
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Wow.

965
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,120
Did you feel that the muscles were expanding?

966
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,120
So cool.

967
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,120
A womanizer.

968
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,120
You're selecting a script again?

969
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
Yes.

970
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,120
I just got them.

971
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,120
They're all characters from the movie, The Firewolf.

972
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,120
Isn't this the image you created for me?

973
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,120
A womanizer, but not a smart one.

974
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,120
Have you ever thought about transforming?

975
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,120
Transform?

976
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,120
The Firewolf gave you many resources and opportunities.

977
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,120
You have to consider every scene.

978
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
Isn't it just the fire?

979
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,120
Zuo Zuo, to make money to play the womanizer,

980
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,120
it will only consume your popularity.

981
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,120
Every character you play in the future

982
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
must be different from the previous one.

983
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
So that you can grow quickly to be a real actress.

984
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,120
But isn't it easier to grasp the same type of character?

985
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,120
The same type of character

986
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,120
will also be easier to frame your acting skills.

987
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,120
Then help me choose one.

988
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
A beauty.

989
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,120
I don't know how to act.

990
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120
The news is a psychological pervert.

991
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,120
He killed so many people and died so tragically.

992
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,120
I can't act.

993
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Zuo Zuo, listen to me.

994
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,120
No matter what you say, I can't act.

995
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
You are the one who is the fire.

996
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,120
But once you are, you must get rid of this drama.

997
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,120
Think about it.

998
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,120
If you can get the best actress in Phoenix Film Festival,

999
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,120
everyone will admire you.

1000
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,120
The best actress?

1001
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Yes.

1002
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Just because of such a character?

1003
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,120
The news is the only actress in this movie.

1004
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,120
She is a disgusting demoness.

1005
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Yes, a demoness that everyone knows.

1006
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,120
She is really disgusting.

1007
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,120
But don't forget.

1008
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,120
The news is not only about evil,

1009
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,120
but also about protecting and kind to your family.

1010
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,120
There is also the struggle and pain of humanity.

1011
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Such a complicated role will make you more clear.

1012
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
You can get rid of the title of a heartbreaker.

1013
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,120
Really?

1014
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,120
As long as you are willing to act.

1015
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
But...

1016
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,120
Zuo Zuo, aunt is right.

1017
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
You should change your character.

1018
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Then...

1019
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,120
I will read it again.

1020
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,120
Look.

1021
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,120
I have already drawn the lines in the script for you.

1022
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,120
I have been reading it recently.

1023
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,120
I will help you memorize some characters' psychology later.

1024
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,120
It will be easier to understand.

1025
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,120
So you have all been connected.

1026
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,120
Then why are you asking me?

1027
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,120
Zuo Zuo.

1028
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,120
I have been thinking about you.

1029
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,120
I have been thinking about you.

1030
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,120
I have been thinking about you.

1031
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,120
I have been thinking about you.

1032
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,120
I have been thinking about you.

1033
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,120
I have been thinking about you.

1034
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
I have been thinking about you.

1035
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,120
I have been thinking about you.

1036
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,120
I have been thinking about you.

1037
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,120
I have been thinking about you.

1038
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,120
I have been thinking about you.

1039
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,120
I have been thinking about you.

1040
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,120
I have been thinking about you.

1041
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,120
I have been thinking about you.

1042
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,120
I have been thinking about you.

1043
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,120
I have been thinking about you.

1044
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,120
I have been thinking about you.

1045
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,120
I have been thinking about you.

1046
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,120
I have been thinking about you.

1047
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,120
I have been thinking about you.

1048
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,120
I have been thinking about you.

1049
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,120
I have been thinking about you.

1050
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,120
I have been thinking about you.

1051
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,120
I have been thinking about you.

1052
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,120
I have been thinking about you.

1053
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,120
I have been thinking about you.

1054
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,120
I have been thinking about you.

1055
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,120
I have been thinking about you.

1056
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,120
Look at the way you come and go,

1057
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,120
holding in the wind and frost.

1058
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,120
Everything is fluttering.

1059
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,120
I'm still stubborn.

1060
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,120
I'm still young and frantic.

1061
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,120
I have a lie

1062
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,120
that never forgets the fire.

1063
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,120
Looking back,

1064
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,120
there will always be a back story.

1065
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,120
Looking back,

1066
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,120
there will always be a back story.

1067
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,120
You and I,

1068
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1069
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1070
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1071
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1072
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1073
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1074
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1075
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1076
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1077
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1078
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1079
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1080
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1081
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,120
I'm not afraid of anything

1082
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Waiting for someone to arrive at the end of the world
