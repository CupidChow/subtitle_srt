1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down this road

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Miss you

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Love you

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't want to be separated from you

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
At that moment

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
The old age

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,240
Turned into a magical eye

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,920
Pass through the loneliness to find you

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,040
Wear the most solid gold armor

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,920
Hold the weapon in your hand

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,840
Use all your strength to fight for the most real self

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
No matter what the little tricks

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,200
No matter what rumors

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,080
I will definitely be invincible

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't want you to be willing

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Where is the gold?

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,440
In the past, I kept this sweet

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,760
No matter where your heart is

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,080
My heart is here

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,200
Even if the iron armor is invincible

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm only one you

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,960
iketif beneficial

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,880
and

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
You choose.

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Janshi, you can't stay there anymore.

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,880
If you stay, it will be a waste of your youth.

34
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Janshi, all the decisions I made,

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
are for your own good.

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Teacher, I think Anxin did the right thing this time.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Qi Wen Sen really reduced me to a lot of work.

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,880
He severely violated the contract.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
I want to officially terminate the contract.

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
I don't want to do anything anymore.

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
I want to practice.

42
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
Okay.

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,880
The wrong judgment of the agent will push you to the corner.

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,880
I believe that one day, you will believe me.

45
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Teacher.

46
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Don't mind that crazy person.

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Listen to me.

48
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,880
No matter what happens in the future, I will be there.

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
She is going to terminate the contract?

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
That's right.

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
The company is so harsh on her.

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Qi Wen Sen wants to skin her.

53
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
She always treats her as her own money-making tool.

54
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Tang Fei.

55
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Ji Qin.

56
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Something happened?

57
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Hello.

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Why so sudden?

59
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Why didn't you tell me?

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
You are filming. I don't want to disturb you.

61
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Such an important thing, you decide it yourself.

62
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Do you know that I am very worried?

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Can't you say sorry?

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Don't worry.

65
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
I will handle this matter.

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,880
You should focus on filming. Don't worry about me.

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,880
You want to piss me off again?

68
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
Are you an idiot?

69
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,880
I am telling you, if I were there, the company wouldn't make such a harsh decision.

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
There will be a chance for a slowdown.

71
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,880
I have something else to do. I will hang up now.

72
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Jiang Xin.

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Are you avoiding me?

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Hello.

75
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Tang Fei. Yue Le.

76
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Jiang Xin has no more scenes.

77
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
What?

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
What is going on?

79
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Nothing.

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,880
I just didn't hear you talking to others like that.

81
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Go to the filming site.

82
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
Let's go.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Okay. Let's go first.

84
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Hello. Is Mr. Wang here?

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Mr. Wang is in a meeting now.

86
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
I have an appointment with him this afternoon.

87
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Can you help me notify him?

88
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
I am really sorry. I didn't receive the notice.

89
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
I will sit there for a while and wait for him.

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Please.

91
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Thank you.

92
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Mr. Wang, you finally finished the meeting.

93
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
I am sorry, I have something else to do.

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:06:00,860
Didn't we agree to discuss the

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
contract?

96
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
We have to pay a huge compensation for three months.

97
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,880
The two companies had agreed to sign you.

98
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Now the group has changed.

99
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
This is really strange.

100
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
I thought if there was a problem in the central government,

101
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
at least we still had Hai Yang.

102
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Hai Yang likes you very much.

103
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,880
He also told me to sign you.

104
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,880
That's why I was so afraid to say goodbye to Qi Wen Sen.

105
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,880
I really didn't expect things to turn out like this.

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
Things have come to this point.

107
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,880
You still haven't seen it.

108
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,880
The boss of Hai Yang Film Company and Qi Wen Sen

109
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
are classmates from overseas.

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
What are you talking about?

111
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
This photo proves everything.

112
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
They have been in private.

113
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Don't you know?

114
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Jian Xi,

115
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
these two companies have never thought of accepting you

116
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
from the beginning.

117
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
How come?

118
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Let's put it simply.

119
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
They were all fooled by Qi Wen Sen

120
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
and deliberately lowered their attitude.

121
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
They have been trying to trick Jian Xi.

122
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
In this way,

123
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,880
you will actively propose a contract with Gong Yu Le.

124
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
When the news of the contract is not spread,

125
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
it will be too late.

126
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
Why did Qi Wen Sen do that?

127
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Isn't he trying to get rid of his own business?

128
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
That's why you have to ask your good agent.

129
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
What does this have to do with An Xin?

130
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
She has been secretly contacting all major economic companies.

131
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
She wants you to get rid of Gong Yu Le as soon as possible.

132
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Gong Yu Le.

133
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Qi Wen Sen has heard about this.

134
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,880
That's why he used such a despicable method

135
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
to completely destroy you.

136
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Jian Xi,

137
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
you should think about it.

138
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
You are the one who proposed the contract.

139
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Your wings are not yet strong enough.

140
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,880
You have to get rid of an economic company like An Xin.

141
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
What will they think?

142
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,880
The board of directors and the public will be very disgusted.

143
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
In terms of morality,

144
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Qi Wen Sen has already taken the lead.

145
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
What's even more terrifying is that

146
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Xia Jia has not been found yet.

147
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,880
How will she deal with the huge compensation?

148
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,880
This is the end of being too hasty.

149
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
An Xin,

150
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
haven't you been saying things?

151
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Do you have any plans for the future?

152
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
I will definitely find a better company for Jian Xi.

153
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
A better company?

154
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,880
I will help you with the huge compensation

155
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,880
and provide you with opportunities.

156
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,880
There are not many companies like this in the industry.

157
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
I will definitely find a better way.

158
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
What other way?

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,880
This is the result of your self-sufficiency.

160
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
That's why you let Jian Xi fall into this situation.

161
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
You have no money to sign the contract and lose morality.

162
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Even if Jian Xi stays,

163
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
it will be very miserable.

164
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
You have to take all the responsibility for this.

165
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Teacher,

166
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
I made the decision.

167
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
I can't blame An Xin completely.

168
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
This has nothing to do with you.

169
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
You are just an actor.

170
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
You are only responsible for acting.

171
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Because you don't know the middle ground.

172
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
But An Xin is different.

173
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
She is your agent.

174
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
She should arrange everything well.

175
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
An Xin,

176
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
you are the culprit of this incident.

177
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Teacher,

178
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
stop talking.

179
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I will talk to Huan Yu.

180
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Teacher,

181
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
no.

182
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Why?

183
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
I don't want to make it difficult for Tang Fei.

184
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Didn't you just play the movie

185
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
that Huan Yu invested in?

186
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,880
This is a two-way thing.

187
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
If Huan Yu takes over now,

188
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
it must be because of Tang Fei.

189
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
Tang Fei knows

190
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
that I am not a good person.

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
I will not let you take the responsibility.

192
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
I will not let you take the responsibility.

193
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
She will be very difficult.

194
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
It's already this time.

195
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Teacher,

196
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
this is my own business.

197
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
I don't want to make it difficult for others.

198
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Then what are you going to do?

199
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Continue to stay in the company.

200
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Have you thought it through?

201
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Do you know what Qi Wen Si will do to you?

202
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
I have thought it through.

203
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Jin Xi,

204
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I was too self-righteous

205
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
and made things like this.

206
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
An Xi,

208
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
I used to be willful too.

209
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,880
You are tolerating me.

210
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
I believe

211
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,880
that we will overcome this difficulty together.

212
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
It's okay.

213
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Let's celebrate.

214
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Our movie

215
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
went very well.

216
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
But

217
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
I feel that Tang Fei's mood

218
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
is too plain.

219
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Tang Fei,

220
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
how about this?

221
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Let's add one more scene.

222
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
The heroine is on the water.

223
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Tang Fei is on the water.

224
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
We also need to add one more scene.

225
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
A scene where the hero escapes in the water.

226
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
He comes up from the water.

227
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
His eyes are sharp.

228
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
The water pig keeps sliding along the mountain.

229
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
How funny.

230
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
How ungraceful.

231
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
This is for the audience to see.

232
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Will they be excited?

233
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Will they be angry?

234
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
If not, let's go that...

235
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
The Shmi's couple's path.

236
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
The scene is beautiful.

237
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Let's make a fire.

238
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
This is not good.

239
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
It should be beautiful.

240
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Romantic.

241
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
The current girls.

242
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
The male gods change every day.

243
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Everyone loves them.

244
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
What do we call this?

245
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
The time is running out.

246
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
I am also a female audience.

247
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Can I say a few words?

248
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Miss Ji, what's your opinion?

249
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
The gods are changing every year.

250
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
The actors are also updating.

251
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
But the only thing that hasn't changed is that

252
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
there are many people who like Tang Fei.

253
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
That means one problem.

254
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Everyone is very much in favor of Tang Fei's eyes.

255
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,880
If you change the way he performs,

256
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,880
can the audience agree?

257
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Miss Ji is right.

258
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,880
And the audience is also for Tang Fei's popularity.

259
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Why is it so obvious now?

260
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
The ticket office can decide everything.

261
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Tang Fei is the guarantee of the ticket office.

262
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,880
So I don't think there's anything to worry about.

263
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Miss Ji is right.

264
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Very reasonable.

265
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
I think the swimming scene.

266
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Let's put it aside.

267
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,880
I want to add a stage in the back of the movie.

268
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
I hope the male and female protagonists get married.

269
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
I don't know what you think.

270
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
This idea is really good.

271
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Think about it.

272
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Don't all the movies now like this?

273
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Surprise the audience.

274
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Tang Fei and Miss Ji's wedding must be very popular.

275
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Director, I think this is not suitable.

276
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
I don't think there's a problem.

277
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
As long as Miss Ji has no problem,

278
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
we will cooperate.

279
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
It doesn't matter.

280
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Anyway, it's the end of the movie.

281
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,880
It's always better than you swimming in the sea, right?

282
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
I'm really happy to talk about it today.

283
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,880
I heard that Miss Ji has always been reserved.

284
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Today, it's not open.

285
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
What do you mean?

286
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
You mean I'm not reserved enough?

287
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Look at my mouth.

288
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Nonsense.

289
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,880
A noble and generous actress like Miss Ji.

290
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Where can I find money?

291
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
I'll buy it myself.

292
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Give me a drink.

293
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Okay?

294
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Come on.

295
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
Ji Qing, you're so generous.

296
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Ji Qing, your forehead is just right.

297
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
You can't drink alcohol for half a year.

298
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
It doesn't matter.

299
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Anyway, I'm happy today.

300
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Happy?

301
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Drink less.

302
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Come on, let's drink together.

303
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Come on, let's drink together.

304
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Cheers.

305
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Cheers.

306
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm sorry, everyone.

307
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
I'm a little drunk.

308
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
I'll go back first.

309
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I'll help you.

310
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Excuse me.

311
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
I'll take you back.

312
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Don't go.

313
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
You're all gone.

314
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
What can I do?

315
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Director, how about I drink with you?

316
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Ji Qing is drunk.

317
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
No way.

318
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Come on, let's drink.

319
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Pour it.

320
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I forgot to take my garbage in the restaurant.

321
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Brother Fei, can you help me send Ji Qing back?

322
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Okay.

323
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Ji Qing, you're the only one left.

324
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Ji Qing, have a good rest.

325
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Where's the reward?

326
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
They're waiting for me downstairs.

327
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
I really have to go.

328
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
I'll go with you.

329
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
I'll go with you.

330
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
I'll go with you.

331
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I'll go with you.

332
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
I'll go with you.

333
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
I really have to go.

334
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Tang Fei.

335
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Tang Fei, don't go.

336
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
What's wrong, Ji Qing?

337
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,880
It's me who knew you first.

338
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
It's because I'm too proud.

339
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,880
I think girls should be reserved.

340
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,880
I think as long as we wait,

341
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
you'll open your mouth first.

342
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,880
I didn't expect that it was because I was too proud

343
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
that I lost you.

344
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Ji Qing, it's none of your business.

345
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
It's my business.

346
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
It must be.

347
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,880
But now, I've changed my mind.

348
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,880
I think in front of love,

349
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
everyone is the same.

350
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,880
In fact, self-esteem is useless.

351
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
It can't be called love at all.

352
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Tang Fei, you actually have feelings for me, right?

353
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,880
So when I was hurt,

354
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,880
you took good care of me.

355
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
But now, why are you so cold to me?

356
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Is it because I did something wrong

357
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,880
that made you angry?

358
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
No.

359
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
It's not like that, Ji Qing.

360
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
You didn't do anything wrong.

361
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Tang Fei, I love you.

362
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
I really love you.

363
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
I treated Jian Xi as my opponent.

364
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Most of the reasons are because of you.

365
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
I'm jealous of her.

366
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
I'm really jealous of her.

367
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,880
I don't know why I'm like this now.

368
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
If I could,

369
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,880
I would give up the title of the best actress.

370
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
I would give it all to her.

371
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,880
And I don't want the appearance.

372
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
I only want you.

373
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
I only want you to come back to me.

374
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Ji Qing, this is not like the one I know.

375
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Me?

376
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,880
What was I like before?

377
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
I only know now.

378
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Actually, I'm not the way I look.

379
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Clouds and wind are light.

380
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
I can't do it.

381
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
I'm very grateful that you like me so much.

382
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,880
But I really can't be by your side.

383
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
I don't understand.

384
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
You understand.

385
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
You're so smart.

386
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,880
It's because you drank too much tonight.

387
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
That's why you said that.

388
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
When you wake up tomorrow,

389
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
I think you will regret it.

390
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Tang Fei.

391
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
You don't have to think about anything now.

392
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Have a good sleep.

393
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
See you at the theater tomorrow.

394
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
You want to stay in the company?

396
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Did I hear wrong?

397
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
It's already like this.

398
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
What are you acting?

399
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Don't you know?

400
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Yes.

401
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
I know everything.

402
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
What do you want?

403
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
I hate the disobedient actors.

404
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,880
You set a bad example for everyone.

405
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
I have to teach you a lesson.

406
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
There's no need to be so hard.

407
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880
It's a trap. Let me jump in.

408
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
You've been very popular lately.

409
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
There are more and more voices supporting you in the board.

410
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
I have to find a way to let the directors know

411
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,880
that actors like you don't deserve company training.

412
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Everything I do is correct.

413
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
You're too cruel.

414
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Thank you for your words.

415
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Okay.

416
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
From today on,

417
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,880
I have no conditions to obey the company.

418
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,880
You can't promise him such harsh conditions.

419
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
It's your duty to be obedient.

420
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
But that's not all I want.

421
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
What else do you want?

422
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Change the contract.

423
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
What do you mean?

424
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
You deducted the cost of your past training.

425
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
You and the company used to be six quarters.

426
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Now I want to change it to two quarters.

427
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
You never gave Jansi a team.

428
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
I did all the work.

429
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Even the salary was given by her.

430
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Two quarters.

431
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
What's the difference between you and the vampire?

432
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
You don't agree?

433
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
We absolutely disagree.

434
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
I don't agree either.

435
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
I just ask you to pay a high penalty.

436
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
I have no other choice.

437
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
You can say that.

438
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Okay.

439
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
I agree.

440
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,880
But Qin Wensi.

441
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
I hope you can keep your word.

442
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Send out a private reconciliation message.

443
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
To stop public opinion.

444
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
And get rid of the company's internal

445
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,880
offense against Anxin.

446
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Let him get back to his position as soon as possible.

447
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Of course.

448
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
I will do what I say.

449
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Tomorrow the TV series,

450
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
The Last Princess, will be on.

451
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
You can play the second daughter.

452
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
That second daughter is a big villain.

453
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
You let Jansi play such a role?

454
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Anxin.

455
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
What do you think?

456
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
I agree.

457
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Do we really want to play such a role?

458
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Or pay a high penalty.

459
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Or we can stay in the company.

460
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
Only two options.

461
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Did you hear?

462
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
The contract was canceled.

463
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
How could it be?

464
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
She changed her mind.

465
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
She is over-reacting.

466
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Poor her.

467
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
I guess.

468
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
There is no better way to get out of the company.

469
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
She deserves it.

470
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
She is so famous.

471
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
She is so ungrateful.

472
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
This woman is so annoying.

473
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Anxin.

474
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Why would Tang Pei like her?

475
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
You think others are deaf.

476
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
They can't hear you.

477
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
That's right.

478
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
We are telling you.

479
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Anxin.

480
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
You can say it again.

481
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Let's go.

482
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
You are really bad.

483
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
You are so stubborn.

484
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Don't pull me.

485
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
I am really angry.

486
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Let me talk to them.

487
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Long time no see.

488
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Right.

489
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
You don't know.

490
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
The first lady of the Mo Dai Gege.

491
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
It's me.

492
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
You knew it when I promised to be the first lady.

493
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Yes.

494
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
I was afraid you didn't have a scene.

495
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,880
It's my suggestion to let you be the Mo Dai Gege.

496
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
You knew I couldn't cancel the contract.

497
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
You framed me.

498
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
Of course I framed you.

499
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
See you on the set.

500
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Jinxi.

501
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
It's my fault.

502
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
I made a mistake.

503
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
That's why things turned out like this.

504
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
It's not your fault.

505
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,880
You are looking for a company for my own good.

506
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Who knows those two companies are Yu'er?

507
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
But.

508
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
I feel bad for you to be her company.

509
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
It's okay.

510
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
As long as there is a role.

511
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
I don't care about anything else.

512
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
And.

513
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
You have to believe me.

514
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
I will be very serious.

515
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
I will be very serious to play this girl.

516
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
When did you let me down?

517
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Then let's keep working together.

518
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Ignore her.

519
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Ignore her.

520
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Let's go.

521
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
Let's go.

522
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Hello, Jinxi.

523
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
It's me.

524
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
I ask you.

525
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
Why did you choose to stay again?

526
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
The company gave me a loan.

527
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Really?

528
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
I have three months left.

529
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Three months later.

530
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
I can come back to see you.

531
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Then.

532
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
I will wait for you.

533
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
That.

534
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
I just received a TV drama.

535
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
I have to read the script.

536
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Let's talk later.

537
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
Jinxi.

538
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Hello.

539
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
I still like you.

540
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
It's really hard for me to hear you say something real.

541
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
But I am happy.

542
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
You finally said it.

543
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
I am sorry.

544
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
I am sorry.

545
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I am sorry.

546
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
I am sorry.

547
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
I am sorry.

548
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
I am sorry.

549
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
I am sorry.

550
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
I am sorry.

551
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
What you said just now.

552
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
You won't take it back, will you?

553
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
What?

554
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
You said you like me.

555
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
I won't say it.

556
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
Let's go see auntie when we are free.

557
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
Okay.

558
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I promise you.

559
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Next week.

560
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
I will have time.

561
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
I will introduce you to my mother.

562
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
I will tell her.

563
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
You are my girlfriend now.

564
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
So fast.

565
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Stop pretending.

566
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
You have thought about it.

567
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
What are you pretending?

568
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Who thinks like that?

569
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
You think like that.

570
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
You are leaving tomorrow.

571
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
I don't know.

572
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
I really don't know how to tell you.

573
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Do you know, Jinxi?

574
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Every time I want to be separated from you.

575
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
I feel like I want to die.

576
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
I never want to see you again.

577
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
I will never see you again.

578
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
I promise you.

579
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
I will come back to see you soon.

580
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
Director.

581
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Xiaoxi.

582
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
Let me tell you something.

583
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
You acted as Ming Rixiang.

584
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
You are the sister of the school's teacher.

585
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,880
And they are all descendants of the royal family.

586
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
But when you were young.

587
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
You were sent to Japan.

588
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
You were trained to be a very good spy.

589
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
When you came back to China.

590
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
The main task is to destroy the school's marriage.

591
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
And seduce her fiance.

592
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
I need a woman with a lot of love.

593
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
You must not stand there like a wooden.

594
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Do you understand what I mean?

595
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
Yes.

596
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,880
Then you go change your clothes.

597
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
Okay.

598
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Thank you, director.

599
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Make-up artist.

600
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Please help her change her clothes.

601
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Okay.

602
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Jingxi.

603
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
You will wear this dress later.

604
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
Why is there a hole here?

605
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
What should I do?

606
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
The shooting is about to start.

607
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Why haven't you checked your clothes?

608
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Is there anything else?

609
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
No.

610
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
What should I do?

611
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
You help her put on makeup.

612
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Come on.

613
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Let me see.

614
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
I'm sorry.

615
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
I'm sorry.

616
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
I'm sorry.

617
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
I'm sorry.

618
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
I'm sorry.

619
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
I'm sorry.

620
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
I'm sorry.

621
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
I'm sorry.

622
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm sorry.

623
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
I'm sorry.

624
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm sorry.

625
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
I'm sorry.

626
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
I'm sorry.

627
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I'm sorry.

628
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
I'm sorry.

629
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
I'm sorry.

630
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
I'm sorry.

631
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm sorry.

632
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
I'm sorry.

633
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
I'm sorry.

634
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
I'm sorry.

635
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
I'm sorry.

636
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
I'm sorry.

637
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
I'm sorry.

638
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
I'm sorry.

639
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm sorry.

640
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
I'm sorry.

641
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
I'm sorry.

642
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
It was late.

643
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
What's going on?

644
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
I asked you to go back to Beijing for six months.

645
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Do you want to be late?

646
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
I want to sit Firth night at that time to friends.

647
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:48,360
I want to stay at Ipoh

648
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,860
for six months to share with your parents.

649
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,860
So I can go back work.

650
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,920
I zwifed into co individual activity these five months started.

651
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,940
Be이는

652
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
You really like it?

653
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,240
You're good at this.

654
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,240
Compared to those women who wear cheongsam and dance in a thick suit,

655
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,240
they can show off their wild ambitions.

656
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
How I love you

657
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
How I hate you

658
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
I love you

659
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
How I hate you

660
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
I love you

661
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
How I hate you

662
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
How I hate you

663
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Or how I love you

664
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,240
I love you

665
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
I love you

666
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Stop. Stop. Stop.

667
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
What? What are you doing?

668
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Director, is this okay?

669
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Is this okay?

670
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,840
You don't know what you're doing, do you?

671
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,600
Am I not good enough?

672
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,680
You're doing so well that I can't see you in the picture.

673
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,240
I only saw the light of Jianxi.

674
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,200
As for whether you're in the picture,

675
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,720
no one cares, you know?

676
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
You're the No. 1.

677
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,000
You don't have to think about the script.

678
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,960
Yes.

679
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,760
This is a small-scale TV show.

680
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
It's not worth your effort.

681
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,280
The No. 1 is a little self-conscious.

682
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,160
At least you let me feel your existence, okay?

683
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,640
No.

684
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,920
Director, I understand.

685
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,280
Jianxi, there's a big show tomorrow.

686
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,560
You should go there and practice.

687
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,240
Okay.

688
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,240
What a...

689
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,680
He's so handsome.

690
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,200
Right?

691
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,120
What do you think?

692
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,800
He's so good.

693
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,280
I'll wear more like this in the future.

694
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,200
Thank you, Mr. Baopeng.

695
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,240
Thank you for your hard work today.

696
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,840
Okay, we're done here.

697
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,240
Okay, go back and rest early.

698
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,960
Be careful.

699
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,080
What are you doing?

700
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I saw everything.

701
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,080
You stole this.

702
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,320
What?

703
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,280
Don't talk nonsense.

704
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,200
I picked it up myself.

705
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
This is mine.

706
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
I didn't ask for it, I just stole it.

707
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,400
Well, I'm not as good as you said.

708
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,080
I can just return it to you.

709
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,800
Here.

710
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,360
What?

711
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,520
I dropped a pair of pearl earrings.

712
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,040
I only picked one.

713
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,760
I'm telling you.

714
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,880
Who believes it?

715
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,440
What else do you want?

716
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,240
If I tell the crew that you stole this,

717
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,280
your dinner will be over.

718
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,720
And you'll be sent to the police station.

719
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,000
No, you can't let the crew know.

720
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,360
Miss Shen, I really picked this up just now.

721
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,920
I picked it up here.

722
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,520
Actually,

723
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,760
whether you stole it or picked it up,

724
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,280
it just needs one word.

725
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,640
As long as you do me a favor,

726
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,160
I'll pretend I didn't see it.

727
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,200
Then what do you want me to do?

728
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,120
No, I'm kidding.

729
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,280
Something must have happened.

730
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,000
Absolutely not.

731
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,240
What are you afraid of?

732
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,960
This is very common.

733
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,960
At most, it's treated as an accident.

734
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,080
What accident?

735
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,800
That's not okay.

736
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,080
I can't do this kind of thing.

737
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,600
Can't you do this?

738
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,640
This...

739
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,920
This is not about money.

740
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,440
What about this?

741
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,440
We can't let the crew know.

742
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,000
Don't worry.

743
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,360
What do you want to eat?

744
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:55,960
Anything.

745
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,760
I'll go buy some vegetarian food for you.

746
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,760
Wait for me.

747
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,940
Yaonan

748
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
Director Qi.

749
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,500
Do you have time to talk?

750
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,120
Don't worry, I didn't do anything evil.

751
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,640
If you are involved, why are you angry?

752
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,720
If you have something to say, let me hear it.

753
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,020
Qいくon Myong-San

754
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,700
Do you want to mistake me?

755
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,420
I did not design all those scenes.

756
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,680
As you know,

757
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,040
I am the one behind Sun Wen Bin's two drive,...

758
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,240
Li Ren Ni is always very affectionate.

759
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,440
Li Ren Ni is either a super-model or a rich man.

760
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,240
You are the first one like this.

761
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,040
I don't believe what you said.

762
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,840
I don't need to lie to you.

763
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
These things can be found out.

764
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,240
A girl like you, Tang Fei, is the first time she has met you.

765
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,840
I admit that it will be a little fresh.

766
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,040
But after a long time, she will inevitably feel bored.

767
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,240
Now, she has to return to her original life.

768
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Enough.

769
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,440
Jian Xin, I know that you are a very hardworking actor.

770
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,840
I have been targeting you because you are not obedient.

771
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,040
But in this matter, I really didn't lie to you.

772
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
I know very well about Tang Fei's personality.

773
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,640
She is a newbie and is very competitive.

774
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,240
Once she really gets it, she will be fearless.

775
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,840
And your career is on the rise.

776
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,240
You are a very dedicated and good girl.

777
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,640
A relationship without results is a waste of time.

778
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,440
After all, you should know the difference between you and Ji Qing.

779
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Give me back your newspaper.

780
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,240
You are a smart businessman.

781
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,240
But when it comes to Ji Qing, you seem to be very stupid.

782
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,440
If Tang Fei is really like what you said, then why would Ji Qing like him?

783
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,440
I don't know if you are belittling me or belittling the woman you like.

784
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,440
I forgot to remind you that you are a successful person.

785
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,840
Stop reading those news.

786
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,640
Spend more time working.

787
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,240
You are still so self-righteous.

788
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,040
I saw Qi Wen Sen earlier.

789
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Yes, I met him.

790
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,440
He didn't do anything to you, right?

791
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,040
It's nothing.

792
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,440
I just chatted with him.

793
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,040
Why are you so rude to him?

794
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Oh, right. We are going to film the explosion tomorrow.

795
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,440
You must be careful.

796
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,840
Don't worry. I will accompany you tomorrow.

797
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,440
Okay?

798
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,240
Okay.

799
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Hurry and eat. There is nothing to eat nearby. I will just buy some food.

800
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,040
Here.

801
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,840
When we start filming, you can just run out from the inside.

802
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,640
We will arrange the rest.

803
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,040
Okay, I got it.

804
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Director, can we ensure safety?

805
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,840
Don't worry. Our explosion room is professional.

806
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,440
If it's convenient, you can use it as a substitute.

807
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,040
What are you doing?

808
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,640
Anxin, is this your first day doing this?

809
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,840
We all have professionals to guide us.

810
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,840
Moreover, as long as we can run out from the inside,

811
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,240
the danger is very low. Don't worry.

812
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
Is the camera ready?

813
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
Okay, director. Is the explosion okay?

814
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,040
No problem.

815
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
Okay, get ready. Don't worry, director.

816
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,240
Be careful. Remember, there is a spot over there.

817
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,040
There is another one over there. Remember it.

818
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,440
Don't worry. No problem.

819
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,040
Ready.

820
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,440
Be careful. Go back.

821
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,640
Is there anyone inside?

822
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,840
Let him hold the gun.

823
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,240
I will call the fire. The actors must be able to hear.

824
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,840
Don't worry, director.

825
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Everyone, ready.

826
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,240
Action.

827
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,840
Action.

828
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,440
Jinxi.

829
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,040
Hurry and tell me. Is everything okay?

830
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,640
Hurry.

831
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,840
It's all my fault.

832
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,640
It's all my fault.

833
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,440
Jinxi, this has nothing to do with you.

834
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,240
I was distracted and was thinking about other things.

835
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,840
If I had been more focused,

836
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,440
if I had run faster...

837
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,840
Listen to me. The faster you run, the more you focus.

838
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,240
What's the use of that? This is an accident. It has nothing to do with you.

839
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
You don't understand.

840
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,040
If I had been more focused,

841
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,040
things like this wouldn't have happened.

842
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,840
It's all my fault.

843
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,040
Director.

844
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,440
You're not calm now. I'll tell you when you're calm.

845
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,040
Old woman, something happened to the production crew.

846
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,440
I'll take you to the airport first.

847
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,040
The rest of the things, let the assistant send them over.

848
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,440
Why isn't she answering my calls?

849
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,840
Don't worry. You can call her tomorrow morning.

850
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,440
Hurry. Let's go.

851
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,040
Get in the car.

852
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,440
I told you to wear a T-shirt, but you still have to follow my true feelings.

853
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,040
If our Jinxi is seriously injured, will you be able to pay for it?

854
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,440
Isn't Jinxi okay now?

855
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,040
Yes, she's fine. There's someone else lying inside.

856
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,840
I didn't ask her to go in. She went in herself.

857
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,240
Director, what do you think the media will think if I report this to them?

858
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,840
They will definitely think that the safety of your crew is very important.

859
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,240
Do you think you can still continue?

860
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,040
Anxin, I think what you need now is to be calm.

861
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,840
It's not that we haven't done any safety tests.

862
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,440
There's really no problem with three accidents.

863
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,840
This is really an accident.

864
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,240
Accident? You're pushing your responsibilities and don't want to pay for it?

865
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,840
How could I possibly mean that?

866
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,240
Then what do you mean?

867
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,840
Can you two stop fighting? Can you be quiet?

868
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,840
How is the doctor?

869
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,040
The patient's injuries are not serious.

870
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,440
But the gas that exploded hit the ground,

871
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,840
causing her arm to be hit by the force.

872
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,040
We've already taken care of it, but she's still in a coma.

873
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,840
We suggest that we still observe her for a week.

874
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,640
Let's see if there are any other situations.

875
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Thank you.

876
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,240
You're welcome.

877
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
I'm relieved now.

878
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,440
I almost got scared to death.

879
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Teacher, you're awake.

880
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,440
It's so late. Why aren't you going back to rest?

881
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,240
Why did you suddenly rush in? You scared me to death.

882
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,840
I'm fine.

883
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,440
Go back. You still have to film tomorrow.

884
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
I'm not going to film tomorrow.

885
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,440
Why?

886
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,840
I want to take care of you here until you fully recover.

887
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,840
That's good. This role is of no use to you.

888
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,440
We can use this chance to end this contract.

889
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,040
Teacher, don't worry about me.

890
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
Hurry and rest.

891
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,840
Don't worry. I'll be fully recovered soon.

892
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,440
Don't worry.

893
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,240
Beautiful.

894
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,940
Un complicating, whose part will you play?

895
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:03,360
Hu Bai's

896
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,460
Here, I иr e.

897
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,800
How was it at home?

898
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,400
Did they say that they want to pack up the hot tea?

899
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,600
I'm just subtlyorrowed, so I just want to pack it up.

900
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,140
OK, I'm getting out of the office.

901
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,540
No one would.

902
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,060
I suddenly feel that what you said is right.

903
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,700
What?

904
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,980
If I could be more careful,

905
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,060
and think about it,

906
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,540
maybe I wouldn't have such an accident.

907
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,540
It's all my fault.

908
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,740
I should concentrate more on my experience.

909
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,980
Don't blame yourself.

910
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,620
I was right before.

911
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,460
Alright.

912
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,460
Let's not think about it.

913
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,900
The most important thing now is

914
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,860
that you can recover soon.

915
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,140
Alright.

916
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,220
Go back and take a shower.

917
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,420
Have a good sleep.

918
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,700
Don't think about anything.

919
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,060
Jinxi.

920
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,180
Tang Fei.

921
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,140
Aren't you in the crew?

922
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,340
I miss you.

923
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,100
What's going on?

924
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,900
What happened?

925
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,140
Where is the wound?

926
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,140
I'm fine.

927
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,380
I'm not hurt.

928
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,980
I cry because I have too many fantasies.

929
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:02,380
The rain falls on the flowers.

930
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,660
The moonlight shines on me.

931
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:13,100
I sing with loneliness.

932
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,300
I watch the flowers wither.

933
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,460
I watch loneliness turn into frost.

934
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,460
I watch the tide rise and fall.

935
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,820
The people are warm.

936
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,900
It's dark and bright.

937
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,620
I have too many wishes.

938
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,420
I become desperate at the end.

939
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,620
I watch you come and go.

940
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,140
I hold on to the wind and frost.

941
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,460
Everything is in a trance.

942
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,180
I am too stubborn.

943
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,820
I have to be young.

944
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,940
I don't want to live in a lie.

945
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:57,060
I look back and think of our past.

946
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,860
We are lost on the road.

947
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,580
I don't think about anything.

948
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:15,500
Where is the heart?

949
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:21,540
I wait for the dawn alone.

950
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,300
I wait for the dawn alone.

951
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:34,500
I wait for the dawn alone.

952
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,340
I wait for the dawn alone.
