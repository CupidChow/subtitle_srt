1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down your own path

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far or far away

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, in the second year

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will be a magical eye

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,760
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Hold the weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Use all your strength to fight against the most real you

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
No matter what the little tricks

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what rumors

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,000
I will definitely be invincible

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't care if you are willing

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,320
In the past, I kept the sweet

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
My heart is here

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,120
Even if the iron armor is invincible

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,880
I'm only one you

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Episode 2

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Jianxi

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Tang Fei

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
Aren't you in the crew?

31
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I'm so worried

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
What's going on?

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
What happened?

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Where is the wound?

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Nothing

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I'm not injured

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
What kind of bad crew are you?

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:54,580
What kind of

39
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm sorry, I'm not in a good mood

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
You were with her in the hospital last night, right?

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Where is your phone?

42
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
I left it in the crew

43
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
I know you are injured

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
I want to come and see you first

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
You will definitely feel very happy

46
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
But it seems that the reality is not like this

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
I

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm fine

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
I came here

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Just to see if you are okay

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm relieved if you are okay

52
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
You are going back?

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Thank you

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Also came back to see me

55
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
It's okay

56
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
You don't have to worry about me

57
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
Take a good movie

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Will

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Do not worry

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
I'll send you

61
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
I'll send you

62
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Am I stupid?

63
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
I sat on the plane all night to see you

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
it is good

65
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
You stay with another man all night

66
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
I tell you, I am your boyfriend

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
I will do that when I encounter that situation

68
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
What do you mean by not worrying about you?

69
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
You are my woman

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm not worried about you, who are you worried about?

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
What's wrong with you?

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
I'm fine

73
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Why are you so loud to me?

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Say so much at once

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
You will be short of oxygen, you don't know

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Why can't I pretend?

77
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
I can't win your sympathy

78
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Silly

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Actually

80
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
You came back to see me

81
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
I am very happy

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm telling the truth

83
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
I didn't see how happy you are at all

84
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
That's more like it

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Tang Fei

86
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
I have something to do

87
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
You go first

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Talk on the phone

89
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Then you

90
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Go quickly, I'll call you

91
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
You take care of yourself

92
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
I'm waiting for you to come back

93
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Tang Fei

94
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
What's going on?

95
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Why is there a problem with the explosion?

96
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
I don't know

97
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
You came back with all your might

98
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Didn't you ask clearly?

99
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Could it be

100
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
That she doesn't welcome you back?

101
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Tang Fei

102
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Didn't you tell her that you didn't rest for 48 hours?

103
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
You came back from the flight of the red eyes

104
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
And you still have to rush back to film?

105
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Did you hear that?

106
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Teacher Lu seems to be badly injured this time

107
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
I guess the crew will lose a lot of money this time

108
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Yes, I think it's so strange

109
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Didn't you say that the editing department would come out and then pay?

110
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Why did you mention money?

111
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
That's right

112
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
This team is too unprofessional

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
It seems that they will lose a lot of money this time

114
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
A good crew has such a thing

115
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Really annoying

116
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
That's right

117
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Everyone

118
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Miss Shen

119
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Hello Miss Shen

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
I am sorry for what happened

121
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
But

122
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
We are in the same team

123
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
We should unite

124
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
And work together to overcome difficulties

125
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Right?

126
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Yes, yes, yes

127
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Miss Shen is right

128
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
We can't be affected by this kind of thing

129
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
We should shoot a good show

130
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
You don't have to care about that Jianxi

131
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
She has a lot of things

132
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
She knows to make up rumors all day long

133
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Since she is not injured, she will come to shoot

134
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
What big play?

135
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Right?

136
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
I think people want to lose money in the crew

137
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
So petty

138
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Everyone, cheer up today

139
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Yes, yes

140
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
What are you doing?

141
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
What are you doing?

142
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
What are you doing?

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
What are you doing?

144
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
You have nothing to do, right?

145
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Let's go

146
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Hello director

147
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Shen Yan

148
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Didn't you say that there was a promotion event

149
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
That Jianxi would join with you?

150
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Yes

151
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Now it seems that

152
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
You can only be the only one who is out of the way

153
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Jianxi is the second daughter

154
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
And this kind of thing has happened

155
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
It's already pitiful

156
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,320
How can I leave her alone to promote?

157
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
This is impossible

158
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
I can understand your mood

159
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
But think about it

160
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Who else can come after this kind of thing?

161
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
If I had this kind of thing

162
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,320
I would have finished the shooting anyway

163
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I didn't expect you to be so careful

164
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
You really make me look at you

165
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
It was a good thing

166
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
How could it become like this?

167
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
It's really too hard

168
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Don't be too sad, okay?

169
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
You adjust that state

170
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
The next promotion

171
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
It depends on you

172
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Director, since you said that

173
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
I will be reluctant

174
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
By the way

175
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Let's take a picture together

176
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Then I put it online

177
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Even if it's for our show

178
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Do a promotion

179
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
it is good

180
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
One two three

181
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Teacher

182
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Don't worry about it

183
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
I will be discharged soon

184
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
It's okay

185
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
I have nothing to do lately

186
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
I can accompany you more

187
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,320
And the teacher was hurt because of me

188
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I should take care of you more

189
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm not angry now

190
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
How can you be angry?

191
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Anxin and I have been disagreeing

192
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Aren't you always embarrassed?

193
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
I know

194
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Actually the teacher has been thinking about me

195
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
I was too willful before

196
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
So I didn't feel it

197
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Really?

198
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,320
If I hadn't been too anxious to terminate the contract with the company

199
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
I wouldn't have been forced to take this show

200
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Anxin is a very good agent

201
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
But

202
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,320
She has been with Mei for too long

203
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
She is used to being high

204
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Leave Mei to come to your side

205
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,320
She doesn't know how to help you at once

206
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Teacher

207
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Actually it has nothing to do with Anxin

208
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
It's my fault

209
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Don't blame her

210
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Jixi

211
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
From now on

212
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Can you believe me?

213
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Let me take you

214
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Step by step to the highest place

215
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Okay?

216
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Believe me

217
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Jixi

218
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Anxin

219
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Why are you here?

220
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,320
I have already made an appointment with the production team

221
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
We don't need to go to the press conference tomorrow

222
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Why?

223
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
It's already like this

224
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Why are you still going?

225
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Why not?

226
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
They are all injured

227
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
You won't let them go to the show again, right?

228
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Jixi

229
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
You don't want to give up halfway, right?

230
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Did I tell you

231
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
No matter what happens

232
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
You must not give up acting

233
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Teacher, don't worry

234
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
I will continue to finish this show

235
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Jixi

236
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Anxin

237
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
I believe you

238
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Anxin

239
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
You go back quickly

240
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
When she is ready for tomorrow's show

241
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
You must remember

242
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Don't be rude in front of the reporters

243
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Teacher

244
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Let Anxin prepare in the afternoon

245
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I can stay here with you

246
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Don't worry

247
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
I just got injured and sick

248
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
It's okay

249
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
You go

250
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
But

251
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Go

252
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Go, go

253
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Teacher, take care of yourself

254
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Go, go

255
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Just blame the temper

256
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
I will go

257
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Yes

258
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Time is up

259
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Hello, everyone

260
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Welcome to the TV series

261
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
The last princess's press conference

262
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Next, let's welcome actress Shen Yan to the stage

263
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Thank you

264
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Why didn't Miss Jianxi participate in the publicity?

265
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Is it an accident before

266
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Made Jianxi and the crew have a conflict

267
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
In fact, this matter

268
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Caused Jianxi great harm

269
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,320
So he can't continue to complete the shooting

270
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,320
I hope everyone can give him more time and space

271
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,320
I believe he can cheer up

272
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Shen Yan, I heard that after the incident

273
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
You went to visit

274
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
But Jianxi refused to visit

275
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Is this true?

276
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Who told us?

277
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Really?

278
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Really?

279
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Is this true?

280
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Dear reporters

281
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
In fact, from the beginning

282
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Shen Yan advised him not to shoot these dangerous scenes

283
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
But he wanted to take the lead

284
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Have to force shooting

285
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
And when it broke down

286
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Obviously, I made a deal with him

287
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
He was hurt because he didn't follow the agreement

288
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Yao Yao, don't say it anymore

289
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Must say

290
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
To make your reputation fair

291
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Actresses like Jianxi

292
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Is a lonely fish

293
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
No responsibility at all

294
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Obviously not hurt

295
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Pretend to be pitiful and sympathize

296
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Such an important publicity today

297
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
No one came to participate

298
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Sorry, we are late

299
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Jianxi, didn't you refuse to attend the scene?

300
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Why did you suddenly come to attend the show?

301
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Who said I'm not coming?

302
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Come, Jianhao

303
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
I thought you couldn't come

304
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
I am explaining to everyone

305
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Sorry

306
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
I just went to the hospital to change the medicine

307
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
So I'm late

308
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
What's the hurry?

309
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Just come

310
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Don't worry if you're fine

311
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
We are waiting for the photo

312
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Come on, the actors are all on

313
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Come on, stand up

314
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Smile

315
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Smile

316
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Yes, a little closer

317
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
Good

318
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Good

319
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Smile

320
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Smile

321
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Smile

322
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Smile

323
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
One more

324
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
One more

325
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Sorry, sorry

326
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
What's going on?

327
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
What's going on?

328
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
What's going on?

329
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
What's going on?

330
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
What's going on?

331
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Listen to what he said

332
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
I haven't said anything

333
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Sorry, are you Miss Shen Yan?

334
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Yes

335
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
We suspect you are related to the explosion case

336
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Please come with us

337
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Explosion case

338
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Explosion case

339
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
I think you should have a lesson

340
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
How is this possible?

341
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Sorry, please cooperate

342
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Please explain to us

343
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Please explain to us

344
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
What's going on?

345
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
You should have a lesson

346
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
This is the scene of the press conference

347
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
You should investigate it clearly

348
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Why is there evidence?

349
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Why did the police come to you?

350
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Why did you come?

351
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
It's him

352
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
You framed me, right?

353
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Zhai Xi

354
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Zhai Xi, what's wrong with you?

355
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
You framed you

356
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Zhai Xi, you are too much

357
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
I treat you as my best friend

358
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
How can you do this to me?

359
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Miss Shen Yan

360
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Please don't talk nonsense

361
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Why am I talking nonsense?

362
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Please believe me

363
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
I didn't do it at all

364
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
He framed me

365
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
I am innocent

366
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Police officer, please deal with it in person

367
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Sure

368
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
This is the scene of the press conference

369
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
You can't do this

370
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
You can't do this to me

371
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Please believe me

372
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Believe me

373
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Please believe me

374
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Police officer

375
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Please believe me

376
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Please believe me

377
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
What's going on?

378
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Why did you arrest him?

379
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Sorry, I can't tell you

380
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
What's going on?

381
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
What's going on?

382
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
What's going on?

383
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
Please believe me

384
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Please believe me

385
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Why is Shen Yan related to the explosion case?

386
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
The assistant of the explosion master has resigned

387
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
I don't know who reported him

388
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
As a result

389
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
When he was caught

390
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
He immediately released Shen Yan

391
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,320
So Shen Yan is the mastermind?

392
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Why would the explosion assistant

393
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Do harm to the show without reason?

394
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
He was bought

395
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Oh my god, how could this happen?

396
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
The competition between the actresses is too terrible

397
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
You didn't read the news

398
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
The actor who is close to the two actors

399
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Who are not seen by the king and the queen

400
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
They all wish that the other party disappears immediately

401
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
But who reported him?

402
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
It's really strange

403
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Let's go

404
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Yanxi

405
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Don't listen to what others say

406
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Hello

407
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Yes, I am Anxin

408
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Guard station

409
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
Shen Yan wants to see you

410
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Yanxi

411
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
I just held the last hope

412
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I didn't expect you to come

413
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I'm going back to the studio

414
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Let's talk for a long time

415
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
It's all my fault

416
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,320
I just wanted to scare you

417
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
I really didn't expect

418
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Such a big accident would happen

419
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
And made Lu Zhou hurt

420
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
I'm sorry

421
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
I'm really sorry

422
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,320
We are the same

423
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Without social background

424
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Climbing from the bottom

425
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
The feeling of being hungry

426
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
He doesn't understand

427
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
But you can feel it

428
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
I know

429
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
I did too much

430
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
I did too many mistakes

431
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
It's not worth your forgiveness

432
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
But all this

433
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
It's life that forces me

434
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
I don't believe in everything

435
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Must be famous

436
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Because only when it's famous

437
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
I have money to treat my mother

438
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Pay off for my father

439
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
I've heard these words

440
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Many times

441
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
You come to me

442
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
What's the matter

443
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
You help me

444
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Please help me

445
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Let me leave this place

446
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
You are committing a criminal act

447
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
This is all a misunderstanding

448
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
It's that assistant

449
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
On purpose to drag me down the river

450
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Not to mention

451
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Lu Zhou, he was just hurt

452
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
He didn't have any substantial damage

453
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
The lawyer told me

454
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
As long as you treat it as an accident

455
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
We can reconcile

456
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
And then withdraw the case

457
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
No way

458
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Jianxi

459
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
You just look at

460
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Our past relationship

461
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
You just help me for the last time

462
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
Okay?

463
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Shen Yan

464
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I thought you knew your fault

465
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
I didn't expect you to be stubborn

466
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
If you want to tell me these words

467
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Then I'll go first

468
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
You are so straight-forward

469
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
You must be serious

470
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Because you haven't reached

471
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
The point of selling yourself for life

472
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
I

473
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
Every day

474
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
It's all through selling yourself

475
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
And the bottom line

476
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
I was not like this before

477
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
I sit in a clean room

478
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
And play the piano

479
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
I have a grudge for the next meal

480
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Who doesn't want to live

481
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
I know

482
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
You hate my hypocrisy

483
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
Hate my poor things

484
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
But all this

485
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
Is taught by life

486
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
I can't even drink water

487
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
I just need to smile at this man

488
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
And I can get a chance

489
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
It's them

490
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
That made me like this

491
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
I hate them all

492
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Calm down

493
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Sit down

494
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Don't be too impulsive

495
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Don't be too impulsive

496
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
No family

497
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
No one loves you

498
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
You are bullied

499
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Is that the reason for your crime?

500
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Because of poverty

501
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
So you go to steal

502
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Because there is no love

503
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
So you steal

504
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Because you were bullied

505
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
So you turned over

506
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
And then you bullied others

507
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
Do you think all this

508
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Is right?

509
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
You can say it so easily

510
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
That's because you don't have my experience

511
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
You always say

512
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
You are the same as me

513
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
But I am not the same as you

514
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Even if I starve to death

515
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
I won't steal and steal

516
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
And I won't lie and betray my friends

517
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
I will only use my own strength

518
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
And try to make those who look down on me

519
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Recognize me

520
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Right is right

521
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Wrong is wrong

522
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
You should pay for your own behavior

523
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Didn't you take revenge

524
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
For your own fault?

525
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
What do you mean?

526
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Why did that broken assistant

527
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Give me out?

528
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
You should know better

529
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
You didn't know

530
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
That assistant gave you out

531
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
What does it have to do with me?

532
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Forget it

533
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
You make it clear

534
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
He has already escaped

535
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
But why was he caught so easily?

536
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
And gave me out so quickly

537
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
Don't you think it's weird?

538
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
You think about it yourself

539
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Hello, Jianxi

540
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,320
How is the situation over there?

541
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
I will go back to the film studio right away

542
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Okay, I'll go over and thank you later

543
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Don't worry

544
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
What's wrong?

545
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
There is one thing

546
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
That's a bit strange

547
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Come in

548
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Lu Zhong

549
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
I have something to talk to you

550
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
What is it?

551
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
I went to the surveillance room

552
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
So?

553
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
The security said

554
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Your assistant

555
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
Lied to the surveillance belt the day before the crime

556
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Yes

557
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
My car was towed at the parking lot

558
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
Where is it?

559
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
I want to find the head of the surveillance

560
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
It's like this

561
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
What do you think?

562
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
The assistant of the security

563
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
May have to prepare for the next day's work

564
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
So he left very late

565
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
But at this time

566
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
He just ran into Shen Yan

567
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
But I don't understand

568
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
If it's Shen Yan

569
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
He should be the one on the road

570
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
There is only a second possibility

571
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,320
It was when the third person was on the scene

572
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
And when the third person left

573
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,320
The surveillance camera happened to be filming me

574
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
You mean

575
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
I'm the third person

576
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,320
If it's not you

577
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Why did you take the surveillance belt?

578
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
But I can't figure it out

579
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Why don't you want everyone to know

580
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
You went to the film studio too

581
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Anxin

582
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
You can go to be a screenwriter

583
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
It's a border

584
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Totally different

585
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Pulled together

586
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
You are too good

587
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
You say he is not a coincidence

588
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
Lu Zhou

589
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
So fast

590
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
That assistant was caught

591
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
And so fast

592
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
This assistant

593
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
He gave it to Shen Yan

594
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Lu Zhou, you say

595
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
What have you done?

596
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
You are simply talking nonsense

597
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
it is good

598
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
Then we will find your assistant to confront

599
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
Lu Zhou, I tell you

600
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Don't act in front of me

601
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
You know Shen Yan

602
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Bought the assistant of the explosion

603
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
You also know he is going to hurt the cut

604
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
You know more about the seriousness of the matter

605
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Anxin

606
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
You know everything

607
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
Why do you still ask?

608
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
I just don't understand

609
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Why don't you stop him

610
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
How to stop him

611
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
One time

612
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Two times

613
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
This time it's an explosion

614
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
What about next time?

615
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Who can stop it?

616
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
We can call the police

617
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
How to call the police

618
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
There is no evidence

619
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,320
Even if Shen Yan is stopped

620
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
He will not be punished

621
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
This is not a reason

622
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
All are not reasons

623
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
If you want to stop him

624
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Today's thing will not happen

625
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,320
You will not live in the hospital

626
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,320
Lu Zhou, I don't understand

627
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
You can hide the truth

628
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
What do you want to do?

629
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
I don't know

630
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
I don't know

631
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
You can hide the truth

632
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
What do you want to do?

633
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
To defeat the opponent

634
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
You have to strike hard

635
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
I can't give him any chance to turn over

636
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,320
I want him to pay a heavy price for his behavior

637
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Are you really trying to stop Shen Yan?

638
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
What else can it be?

639
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
For Jansi

640
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
You are in the hospital for him

641
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
He will definitely be grateful

642
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
He will listen to you as before

643
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Lu Zhou

644
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,320
You are not really good for Jansi

645
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,320
You are selfish and hypocritical

646
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
You go tell Jansi

647
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
Go

648
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
What?

649
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
If you tell Jansi

650
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
What will she think?

651
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Thank you

652
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
She can't stand this blow

653
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
She is different from others

654
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
She is not only good for acting

655
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
She doesn't know human feelings

656
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
I don't know how the world works

657
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
She is strong on the outside

658
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
But she is afraid of being abandoned inside

659
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
If you tell her

660
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,320
She will definitely be hit

661
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
You want to tell her?

662
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
Go ahead

663
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Tell her

664
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
I won't stop you

665
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
Hello, Jansi

666
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I will go out to buy something

667
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
I will be back soon

668
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Ok, wait for me

669
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
Lu Zhou, I am telling you

670
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,320
I am not doing this for you

671
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
I am doing this for Jansi

672
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
If you do this again

673
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,320
I will tell Jansi

674
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
I will go out to buy something

675
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Why don't you explain it clearly?

676
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Because she is telling the truth

677
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
I know the whole truth

678
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
But I chose to hide it

679
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
No

680
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,320
You protected Jansi

681
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
My protection is my purpose

682
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
I only know

683
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
If it wasn't for you

684
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Jansi would be seriously injured

685
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
You know someone hurt her hand

686
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
But it's a blast

687
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,320
We can't predict the consequences

688
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
You don't know

689
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,320
What kind of damage you will be hurt

690
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
I really can't understand

691
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Your feelings for protecting someone

692
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,320
I just want to make a bet with myself

693
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Make a bet?

694
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
If I win

695
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Jansi can come back to me

696
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Like before

697
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
But what if you lose?

698
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Actually, I just want to exchange one thing

699
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,320
The two most precious words in this world

700
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Trust

701
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
If I lose

702
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,320
That's my fate

703
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Can Anxin really keep her secret?

704
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
I'm sorry

705
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Let's go

706
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Jansi

707
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Why are you so slow?

708
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
I don't know what to say

709
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Hello, Fusheng

710
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Teacher has to leave the hospital

711
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,320
I've sent her back

712
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
How can you leave the hospital now?

713
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
I said she didn't listen

714
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Or you come back now

715
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Ok, I'll be right there

716
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Anxin, go to teacher's house

717
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Aren't we going to the film studio?

718
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
It's too late, go to teacher's house

719
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Jansi

720
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,320
I ask you

721
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,320
If Lu Zhou is not what you imagined

722
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,320
What will you do?

723
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,320
What do you mean?

724
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,320
Nothing

725
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Let's talk later

726
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Why are you here?

727
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Teacher, you should be in the hospital

728
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Why are you back?

729
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm fine

730
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Of course I can come out

731
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
If the teacher insists on leaving the hospital

732
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Then I'll stay and take care of you

733
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
What do you eat for lunch?

734
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
I bought all the supplies in the refrigerator

735
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
All convenient food

736
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
It's convenient to eat like this

737
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
You can eat it when it's hot

738
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
But it's not nutritious

739
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Jansi, I said she can take care of herself

740
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Let's go

741
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Teacher, your wound has not healed yet

742
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
You should eat something light

743
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
I'll help you prepare

744
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
We have to shoot a play in the afternoon

745
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Anxin

746
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
Anxin is right

747
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
You should focus on your work

748
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
I can take care of myself

749
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
You go to shoot

750
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
I want to do something for you

751
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
Lu Zhou, you are enough

752
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
Anxin

753
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
You know what's going on

754
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
You know the accident will happen

755
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
You do this to tie Jansi

756
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
Let her listen to you, right?

757
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
Anxin, what are you talking about?

758
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
Do you forget what Shen Yan said?

759
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
He said someone did not care

760
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Just to be a hero in front of you

761
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
You believe what Shen Yan said

762
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
I know

763
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
I will delay a lot of work today

764
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
But I will try my best to make up for it

765
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
I also ask you not to talk to the patient like this

766
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Jansi

767
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
For your plan

768
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
I have a disagreement with Anxin

769
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
It's inevitable to have a conflict

770
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
But I believe

771
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
She must be good for you

772
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Lu Zhou, you are really a hero

773
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
The play is so good

774
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Enough, Anxin, do you believe her?

775
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
I believe her

776
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Lu Zhou, I tell you

777
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
The play is the play

778
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
There will be a day when it will be over

779
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
You choose it yourself

780
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Teacher, I'm sorry

781
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Anxin is in a bad mood

782
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
So she said such strange words

783
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
Jansi

784
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
I think for Anxin

785
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
You should give up

786
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
She is completely blocking your steps

787
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
It's no use

788
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Give up

789
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Teacher, maybe you misunderstood

790
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Actually, Anxin has been helping me

791
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
I know her better than you

792
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
You want to improve

793
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
You have to learn a lot

794
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
The first one is to give up

795
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Follow me

796
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Look at these shining trophies

797
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
If you want to step by step

798
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
You have to give up all the people who are bothering you

799
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
What about the second step?

800
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
For now

801
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Learn to play

802
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
If the scene of this play is changed

803
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
Can you explain it clearly?

804
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
Tang Fei

805
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
You are tired these two days

806
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
Why don't you go in and rest

807
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
I'll tell you when they're done

808
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
The weather is so good

809
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
I'll tell you when they're done

810
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
Go

811
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
Change, you must change

812
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
I'm not saying you can't change now

813
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
Can we explain it after the scene is changed?

814
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
We discuss it to clarify this point

815
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
I will change the script and keep the play going

816
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
The most troublesome thing now is to be affected by the weather

817
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Director

818
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
How long is this play going to be filmed?

819
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
It was filmed for four months

820
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
It's been a week now

821
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
You must solve this problem these two days

822
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
I don't want to

823
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
It rains every day

824
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
This play is the sunrise

825
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
It's a big play

826
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
If you don't shoot, everyone will lose

827
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Please

828
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
We want to wait

829
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
But you know that Tang Fei's play is full

830
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
If we have more time

831
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Our loss will be great

832
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Mr. Yue

833
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
This play

834
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Must be filmed

835
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
Because the importance of the whole play

836
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Hello, it's me

837
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
I have something to ask you

838
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
It's me

839
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Ji Qin

840
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Tang Fei is resting

841
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
If you need it, I can wake him up

842
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
No need

843
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
Then do you have anything?

844
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
I

845
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Nothing special

846
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Then I hang up

847
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
Zai Xi

848
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Because Tang Fei's work is really hard recently

849
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
If there is nothing special

850
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Don't call me

851
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Xiaoudo

852
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
's famous act

853
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Let's go

854
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Let's go

855
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
You didn't tell Jianqi that you're coming back today?

856
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
I told her, but she didn't reply.

857
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Don't wait for her.

858
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
She has a fan meeting. She can't come.

859
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
How about this?

860
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Did she tell you about the fan meeting?

861
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
She's too busy. She might not be able to make it.

862
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
Tang Fei, your car is here. Let's go.

863
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Let's go.

864
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Let's go.

865
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Let's go.

866
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Let's go.

867
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Let's go.

868
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
Let's go.

869
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Let's go.

870
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Stop looking. Let's go.

871
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Let's go.

872
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Let's go.

873
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
How is it? Is the shooting going well?

874
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Ji Qing.

875
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
Everything is fine.

876
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
It's going well. Right, Ji Qing?

877
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
It's going well.

878
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
I originally planned to let you rest for a while.

879
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
But now you have a very good role.

880
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
I hope you can go and fight for it.

881
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
Jianqi, this is a gift for you.

882
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Thank you, Jianqi.

883
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
Jianqi, thank you.

884
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Jianqi, this is a gift for you.

885
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
Thank you.

886
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
Jianqi, hello.

887
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
Thank you.

888
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Hello, this is my gift.

889
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
Jianqi, I've liked you for a long time.

890
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Thank you.

891
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Jianqi, I can shake hands with you.

892
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
Thank you.

893
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Thank you, Jianqi.

894
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Thank you.

895
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
Jianqi, thank you.

896
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Jianqi, drink some tea.

897
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Jianqi, help me to sign here.

898
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Thank you.

899
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Jianqi.

900
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
Jianqi, you're in a good mood.

901
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
Who is it?

902
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Why is it you?

903
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Why are you here?

904
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
Where is Tang Fei?

905
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Jianqi, can I take a picture with you?

906
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Look here.

907
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Thank you.

908
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Jianqi, this is for me.

909
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Thank you.

910
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Jianqi.

911
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Thank you.

912
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Shake hands.

913
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Why are you here?

914
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
I told you I would come back today.

915
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
You don't go to the school,

916
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
you have to tell me if you have a fan meeting.

917
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
This is a temporary decision.

918
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
Even if it's temporary,

919
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
you still have a chance to tell me.

920
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
I'm a little upset now.

921
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
You have to think about how to make up for me.

922
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
I...

923
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Come in.

924
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
Teacher.

925
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
It's time. We should go.

926
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Where?

927
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
I'm going to meet a producer today.

928
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
I just came back.

929
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
It's time.

930
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
We should go.

931
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
I'll be right there.

932
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Tang Fei, let's call and contact.

933
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
What's going on?

934
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Anxin, Jianqi is going to meet a producer.

935
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
You're not going?

936
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
I'm a manager now.

937
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
What do you mean?

938
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
All Jianqi's work

939
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
is arranged by Lu Zhou.

940
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
If Jianqi didn't protect me,

941
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
I would have lost my job.

942
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
What do you mean?

943
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
Can't you see?

944
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Jianqi listens to Lu Zhou.

945
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
I'm really angry.

946
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
How can you be a manager?

947
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
You're the boss of the class.

948
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
You think I'm willing to leave

949
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
because of my old temper?

950
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
Why didn't you leave?

951
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
I just wanted to

952
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
get rid of him.

953
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
Lu Zhou is a cunning and good actor.

954
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
I wanted to get rid of him

955
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
but I failed.

956
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
What happened

957
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
when I left?

958
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
A lot of things happened.

959
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Which one do you want to hear?

960
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Teacher, why are we here today?

961
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Are we playing basketball?

962
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Director Xu Ziyu will play tennis here.

963
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
You must perform well.

964
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Director Xu Ziyu?

965
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Is he the director of the royal family?

966
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Yes.

967
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
He's going to make a new movie

968
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
called The Queen.

969
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
You must win the first place.

970
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
The first place?

971
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Yes. As long as you win the first place,

972
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
the best actress of next year

973
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
will be yours.

974
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Now you know

975
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
why I let you play basketball so hard.

976
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
To please a director?

977
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Of course not.

978
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
I didn't let you please a director.

979
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
I wanted to let everyone know

980
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
how good you are.

981
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Lu Zhou.

982
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Director Xu.

983
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Hello.

984
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
This is Jianxi, right?

985
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Hello, director.

986
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Nice to meet you.

987
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320
Lu Zhou sent me the movie you've made

988
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
before the exam.

989
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
I've seen all your roles.

990
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
But,

991
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,320
I need to think about

992
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
my role again.

993
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Director Xu, Jianxi

994
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
loves playing tennis.

995
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
Do you want to play with us?

996
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Sure. Let's play together.

997
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Director Xu.

998
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
So lively.

999
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
You're late.

1000
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
Sorry.

1001
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
So, Miss Ji Qing

1002
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
is very loyal to this role.

1003
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
The King of Ice

1004
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
is the movie you're looking forward to this year.

1005
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
I want to play the role of the first actress.

1006
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
But,

1007
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
the final decision is in the hands of the director.

1008
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Let's not talk about this today.

1009
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
Let's play a game.

1010
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
Okay?

1011
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
Come on.

1012
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Come on.

1013
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
Come on.

1014
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
You're here so soon.

1015
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
What are you doing?

1016
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
What?

1017
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
I'm not going to say anything.

1018
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,320
You're getting rid of your worries.

1019
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
What do you want to do?

1020
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Get rid of my worries?

1021
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Isn't that right?

1022
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
From the first agent

1023
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
to the assistant.

1024
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
You don't even let her participate in such an important event.

1025
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
I think you've misunderstood.

1026
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
I'm doing this out of goodwill.

1027
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
I hope Jianxi

1028
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
can win the heroine.

1029
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Is it that simple?

1030
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
It's that simple.

1031
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
Okay.

1032
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
Tang Fei.

1033
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
Tang Fei.

1034
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
You come.

1035
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
Come on.

1036
00:43:46,480 --> 00:44:09,040
Softens a einem怍ω

1037
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:16,080
Look at the bustling city, look at the lonely street

1038
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,680
Look at the tide, the cold and the cold, the sky is dark and the sky is bright

1039
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:28,280
There are too many expectations, in the end, there is despair

1040
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:35,200
Look at you coming and going, holding on to the wind and frost, everything is wandering

1041
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,360
Too stubborn, but young and crazy

1042
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:47,480
There is absurdity, don't forget me

1043
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,840
Looking back, all the grudges will have a return

1044
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:59,800
You and I, gradually lost on the road

1045
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:05,840
Too crazy, don't think about anything

1046
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:12,040
Where is the heart that is still in a trance?

1047
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:17,400
Just like this, waiting for someone to dawn

1048
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:23,560
Just like this, waiting for someone to dawn

1049
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:30,920
Just like this, waiting for someone to dawn
