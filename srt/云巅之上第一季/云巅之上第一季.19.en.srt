1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,440
Go down your own path

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
I don't want

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
No matter who is far away

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, the standard age

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,240
Transformed into magical eyes

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,880
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
Put on the most ancient gold armor

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
Hold the weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,800
Use all your strength to fight for the most real you

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,400
No matter what the little tricks

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,160
No matter what rumors

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,080
I will definitely be invincible

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,400
I don't care if you are willing

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,400
In the past, I kept the sweet

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,720
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,040
My heart is here

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,160
Even if the world is invincible

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,960
I only have you

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,720
The Love by Hypnotic

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,560
Episode 35

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,640
Ji Qing

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,160
I am the same

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
I have come all the way

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,840
Met a lot of setbacks

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,960
Several times

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,440
I was leaving

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
And stayed at last

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760
You may not know

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,920
In fact, I cried many times because of you

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,000
Because I feel compared to you

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,520
I am like a rotten mud

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,000
Nothing is

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,880
You are prettier than me

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,480
More smart than me

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
And love your father

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
And the favor of the public

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
In fact, compared to you

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,160
I am the one who should be jealous

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,320
But I didn't make this jealousy become painful

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,960
I let it become the motivation for me to move forward

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,080
I tell myself

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,360
One day, I must catch up with Ji Qing

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,040
I want to stand on the same stage with him

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,760
Ji Qing, thank you

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,240
Thank you for the motivation for me to move forward

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,520
What do you think we should eat tonight?

55
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,720
How about we go to the cinema first?

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,520
But there are no good movies that have been released recently

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
Jin Xi

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,000
Why are you so nervous?

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,120
Did you encounter any trouble during the filming?

60
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,760
Quite a bit of trouble

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,240
What is it?

62
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,920
Because of me

63
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,640
And because of you

64
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,080
I didn't film your movie

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,640
What does it have to do with me?

66
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,280
Ji Qing likes you very much

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,000
It seems that because of the fact that we are together

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,680
She is quite painful

69
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,200
That can't be because she doesn't like it

70
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
We are not together

71
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,160
You don't understand

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,640
If I don't reconcile with her

73
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,720
It will be hard to continue filming this movie

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
Jin Xi, relax a bit

75
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,800
Don't be so anxious

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,200
You won't let your boyfriend betray his thoughts

77
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,120
Because of Ji Qing's emotions, right?

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,160
That's not what I mean

79
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,760
Then what should I do to make you happy?

80
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,800
I don't know either

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,040
Tang Fei

82
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,640
Let me discuss something with you

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,200
Go ahead

84
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,600
During this time

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,440
Let's not meet first

86
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,360
No

87
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,360
I mean during the filming of this movie

88
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's try to meet less

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,760
Especially don't come to the scene

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
I don't want to hurt Ji Qing

91
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,560
I also want to finish this movie well

92
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,440
Okay?

93
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,080
Will you promise me?

94
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
I beg you

95
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,480
Let me tell you

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,040
My biggest patience is to wait for the day when this movie is finished

97
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,680
I can't wait for another day

98
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,160
I promise you

99
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,400
I call you every day

100
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,760
You have to answer it immediately

101
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,680
I send you WeChat every day

102
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,400
You must come back as soon as you see it

103
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,440
Anything else?

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,120
Yes, a lot

105
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,520
I promise you

106
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,440
Recording

107
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,240
27 scenes, 2 scenes, 1 word

108
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Action

109
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
Xiaowu

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,720
Do you know where this person is?

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,200
I don't know this word

112
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,160
This word is Nian Kang

113
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Do you know where he is?

114
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,920
Your Majesty

115
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,880
Let me help you go home and ask my mother and brother

116
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,400
No need

117
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,640
You remember

118
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,360
This matter can only be known by yourself

119
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,720
No one else can know

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,800
By the way

121
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,440
You don't know Chinese characters

122
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,160
You have to learn more in the future

123
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,680
I obey

124
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
Didn't you say you would teach me to play the zither?

125
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,480
This zither was asked by the person

126
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,000
You try

127
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Cut

128
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Pass

129
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
The next scene is

130
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Zhu Yinggong likes Rong Ling

131
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,280
He asked Cixi for a marriage

132
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,480
Cixi agreed

133
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,280
Rong Ling is extremely unwilling

134
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,080
De Ling willingly stood up

135
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,280
On behalf of sister

136
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,680
Married to Zhu Yinggong

137
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Just this scene

138
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
I think it's a good scene

139
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,680
I think it's a good scene

140
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
I think it's a good scene

141
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
I think it's a good scene

142
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
I think it's a good scene

143
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
I think it's a good scene

144
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
To marry to Zhu Yinggong

145
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,080
Just this scene

146
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,680
You two play well

147
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,480
Continue to play the words of Mao He Shen Li

148
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,680
Just play it automatically

149
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
OK, get ready

150
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,880
All right

151
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,680
Everybody, get ready

152
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
34 scenes 2 scenes 1

153
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Idiot

154
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Where are you going?

155
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Where are you going?

156
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
I am going to find my ancestors

157
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
I don't want to marry Zhu Yinggong

158
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Does it depend on your character?

159
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Doesn't my ancestor like me?

160
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
I'll tell him.

161
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,080
Maybe he'll agree.

162
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,480
The Empress Dowager is here.

163
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

164
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
You may rise.

165
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,280
Xiaowu.

166
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,080
Aren't you going to take a picture today?

167
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
That...

168
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,280
You brought that?

169
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
I did.

170
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,480
Hurry up.

171
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,680
Hurry up and take a picture for Your Highness.

172
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,880
Your Highness, please wait.

173
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,080
Your Highness, it's not enough.

174
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,880
No need to kneel.

175
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

176
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,280
One, two, three, smile.

177
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,280
You're done.

178
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm done.

179
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
It's so fun.

180
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,680
This Western style is interesting.

181
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,080
Let me take one too.

182
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,280
Your Highness, please wait.

183
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,080
You two go, I'll take a picture for you.

184
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Why is the portrait upside down?

185
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Are you two standing upside down or standing with your feet?

186
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Interesting.

187
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Elderly ancestor, this portrait is upside down.

188
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
It's really fun.

189
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Interesting.

190
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Elderly ancestor is so happy now, can I say it now?

191
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
No, I can't hold it anymore.

192
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Elderly ancestor, I don't want to marry Zhu Ying.

193
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Take it away.

194
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
No rules.

195
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
I won't take it.

196
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Next, I, De Ling, for the sake of sisterhood, stand out bravely for the first time.

197
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,280
This is all because of sisterhood.

198
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Normally, you are like a fire treasure.

199
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Now you are so unruly.

200
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Wu, what did you say to me just now?

201
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
I...

202
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Elderly ancestor, please take back the order.

203
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Third Miss, what are you doing?

204
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Zhu Ying wants a wife who is good in both the capital and the outside world.

205
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,280
I think this person must be careful.

206
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Rong Ling is young and ignorant, it's easy to cause trouble.

207
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,280
If you marry her, you will definitely ruin the reputation of the palace.

208
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
The order has been made.

209
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Tell me, what should I do now?

210
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,280
The order says that the Yu family's daughter should marry.

211
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,280
There is more than one daughter in the Yu family.

212
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Sister.

213
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Elderly ancestor, don't.

214
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,280
You two are really sisterly.

215
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
That's good.

216
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,280
But you said that the Zhu Ying Palace's ambassador will not have any opinions.

217
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,280
As long as it is the meaning of the elderly ancestor, there will definitely be no opinion.

218
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
All right, thank you.

219
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Thank you, Elderly ancestor.

220
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Thank you.

221
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
What's wrong?

222
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
You are still not happy?

223
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Thank you, Elderly ancestor.

224
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Cut.

225
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Director, how did we play this scene?

226
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Let's see the next scene.

227
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
OK.

228
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Come on, get the knife and put it on.

229
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Jianxi, remember the scene.

230
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
This scene is still the same.

231
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
I want you to show your sisterly love.

232
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Tang Fei, why are you here?

233
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
No, let me see Jianxi.

234
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
I'll call her for you.

235
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
No, I'm fine here.

236
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Come on, it's not appropriate to see her.

237
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
I told her before.

238
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Before this scene was killed, we didn't see each other.

239
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Why?

240
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
No reason.

241
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
You are angry in this scene.

242
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Don't worry, I saw it.

243
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
I'll go back first.

244
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Weird.

245
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Two scenes in twenty-three scenes.

246
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Action.

247
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Sister, you can't marry the Zhu Ying master.

248
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
His beard is white.

249
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
I'll go to the emperor.

250
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Stop.

251
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Cut.

252
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
Ji Qing, you are not in the mood.

253
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Do it again.

254
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
OK.

255
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Two, action.

256
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Sister, you can't marry the Zhu Ying master.

257
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
His beard is white.

258
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
I'll go to the emperor.

259
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Ji Qing is injured.

260
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Why are you holding me?

261
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
The director didn't shout.

262
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
I've said it many times.

263
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
You can't be like this after you enter the palace.

264
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
You can't do whatever you want.

265
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
You can't mess up at any time.

266
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
I...

267
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Even if you suffer a lot, you have to swallow it.

268
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Remember, don't run around without wearing a suit.

269
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,280
If the ancestors see you, they will punish you.

270
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Ji Qing, you like the emperor.

271
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Why did you marry the Zhu Ying master?

272
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
But he likes you.

273
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
OK.

274
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
OK.

275
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,280
No matter what happens, I will protect you.

276
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Ji Qing is so good.

277
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Jiang Xi, I will never lose to you.

278
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Sister, let's run away together.

279
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Let's run away from the Forbidden City.

280
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
So he also realized it.

281
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
What do you mean?

282
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
The light of consciousness was taken away by Ji Qing.

283
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,280
So he started to think about the future.

284
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
He started to fight for the camera.

285
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Next life?

286
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
This is the real actor.

287
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
The action is faster than thought.

288
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Sister used to protect me.

289
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
But now Xiao Wu has grown up.

290
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
I can't let sister suffer alone.

291
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Let's run away together.

292
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Let's escape from this miserable palace.

293
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I want to protect sister.

294
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Cut. Pass.

295
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Next.

296
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Next.

297
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Why are you crying?

298
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
Who bullied you?

299
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Your Majesty.

300
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
My father is sick.

301
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Sister and I are on leave.

302
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
We have to leave the palace.

303
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Will you come back after this?

304
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
What a pity.

305
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
I thought I learned this song.

306
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I can play it for you in person.

307
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Silly girl.

308
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Actually, it's a good thing to leave.

309
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,280
It's better than staying in this huge palace.

310
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
But Kang Youwei has left.

311
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Zhen has left.

312
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Now you have to leave too.

313
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Everyone around me has left.

314
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Your Majesty.

315
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Let's go.

316
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
The farther the better.

317
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Just like a happy bird.

318
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Never come back.

319
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Your Majesty, goodbye.

320
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Your Majesty.

321
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
Cut. Pass.

322
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Cut.

323
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Come on. Drink some water.

324
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Jianxi.

325
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Our competition has just begun.

326
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
You are my opponent.

327
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Don't let me down.

328
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,280
I will wait for you at the Phoenix Film Festival next year.

329
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
You must work hard.

330
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
You too.

331
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Come on.

332
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Director Li.

333
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
You are late.

334
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
We just finished shooting.

335
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I am late.

336
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Lu Zhou.

337
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
When you recommended Jianxi to play Rong Ling.

338
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
I thought it was not appropriate.

339
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Because this girl has played many complicated roles.

340
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Let her play a white-fingered Rong Ling.

341
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
It's really unacceptable.

342
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
But now I know you are right.

343
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
She can play any role.

344
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,280
I let her play Rong Ling because I want to expand her career.

345
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
And stimulate her fighting spirit.

346
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Fighting spirit?

347
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Didn't you notice?

348
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Every time she meets her lover.

349
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
She must be fighting.

350
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
But.

351
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
But what?

352
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Jianxi.

353
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
She values acting too much.

354
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
And even gambles on her whole life.

355
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Such a female actor is actually very dangerous.

356
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
As her teacher.

357
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
You should remind her.

358
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
I don't think so.

359
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
As an actor.

360
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
If you don't play the purest play.

361
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Then what can she play?

362
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
It can only prove.

363
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
She can't do anything.

364
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
But Lu Zhou, have you ever thought.

365
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Jianxi sees her career as her life.

366
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
If one day she can't play.

367
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
It will be a devastating blow.

368
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
She won't.

369
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Because I.

370
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
Will help her walk step by step.

371
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Until she can reach the peak.

372
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
The peak that an actor can reach.

373
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Director Li.

374
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Thank you for your help to Jianxi.

375
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Goodbye.

376
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Lu Zhou.

377
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Jianxi is not your specialty.

378
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
You can't keep acting like this.

379
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
It will ruin her.

380
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Next is.

381
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
The script discussion of the love of Qingcheng.

382
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
The director wants to ask the director's opinion.

383
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
You should prepare.

384
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
It seems that she is not far from the mountain.

385
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Who?

386
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Jianxi.

387
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Of course.

388
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
She is now in the spotlight.

389
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
The halo of Tang Fei's girlfriend.

390
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
And she shot the big movie of director Li Hong.

391
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Of course, she is popular.

392
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
What does it have to do with me?

393
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
How can it be?

394
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
An actor wants to be popular for a long time.

395
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
It can't be based on rumors.

396
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
But on strength.

397
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
But in two days.

398
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
You are going to film in other places.

399
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Did you tell her?

400
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
I heard from the company staff.

401
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Her schedule is scheduled until the end of next year.

402
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
I'm afraid you can't see each other for a long time.

403
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
I'm talking to you.

404
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Can you answer me quickly?

405
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Where are you going to die?

406
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Let me help you.

407
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
No need.

408
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
What if Zhang Deng breaks the dress?

409
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
It's not that exaggerated.

410
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Take it.

411
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
No need.

412
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
If people see it, they will be surprised.

413
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
Sorry.

414
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
This is the new shoes released this year.

415
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Is it useful to say sorry?

416
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
What shoes do I have?

417
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
How much do I have to pay you?

418
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
I know.

419
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
What do you know?

420
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
You must have been looking for trouble on purpose.

421
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
You know that my family's situation

422
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
is to spend four months with Tang Fei alone.

423
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
Or to be in a relationship.

424
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Are you jealous?

425
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Are you angry with me on purpose?

426
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Is this woman's brain as messy as her hair?

427
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,280
You mean, the filming will start by the early morning?

428
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Tang Fei didn't tell you?

429
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
You talk really well.

430
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
You didn't bite your tongue, did you?

431
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
What did you say?

432
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,280
I said, did you bite your tongue?

433
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
You were bitten by a cat.

434
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Let's go.

435
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Say it again.

436
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Next time, change your shoes.

437
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Anxin.

438
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Tang Fei.

439
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Tang Fei.

440
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Tang Fei.

441
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm going to meet you.

442
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
I'll see you again.

443
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm going to meet you.

444
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I'm going to meet you.

445
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
What are you doing?

446
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,480
Aren't you afraid of death?

447
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,960
How can you come to my house like this?

448
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,640
Are you sick?

449
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,160
Why are you locking the door?

450
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,080
What are you doing?

451
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,320
Are you sick?

452
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,600
What are you doing?

453
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,320
Let me go.

454
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,280
What are you doing?

455
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,920
You're wearing a mask.

456
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,360
Don't use my mask.

457
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,080
What?

458
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm going to join the event of the Unifan.

459
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm going to drink water tonight.

460
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,920
Is the event important or me?

461
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,400
What are you doing?

462
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,680
Let's go.

463
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
You haven't answered my call all day.

464
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,880
Do you know how many times I called you?

465
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,360
Why didn't you answer?

466
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,120
What are you doing?

467
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,840
Who made you angry?

468
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,920
Did you encounter any unhappy things?

469
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,720
No.

470
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,880
You won't tell me, right?

471
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,760
No.

472
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,680
You won't tell me, right?

473
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,520
You won't tell me, right?

474
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,840
What are you doing?

475
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,640
You won't tell me, right?

476
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,040
Okay, I'm leaving.

477
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,640
Tang Fei.

478
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,120
Tang Fei.

479
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,200
Tang Fei.

480
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,000
What?

481
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,960
Go to hell.

482
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,760
Okay.

483
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,720
I'll show you what I'm made of.

484
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,560
I'll give you one last chance.

485
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,120
Will you say it or not?

486
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,480
Alright.

487
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,320
Later tomorrow,

488
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,680
I don't even know

489
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,440
if you're leaving.

490
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,320
Is that what you want?

491
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
Am I your girlfriend or...

492
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,520
I heard this from someone else?

493
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
I really don't know how to tell you.

494
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,600
Do you know, Jian Xin?

495
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,480
Whenever I wanted to separate from you,

496
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,280
I feel like we'd be separated by death.

497
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,000
It's like I never ever see you the same.

498
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
I'm not happy about this.

499
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
How long are you going to be gone?

500
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Four months.

501
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Then I'll see you off tomorrow.

502
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
No.

503
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Don't you have a big event tomorrow?

504
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
I'm not going.

505
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
You can't be willful.

506
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Why?

507
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,120
Be obedient.

508
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,120
I promise you.

509
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
I'll be back to see you soon.

510
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I'm leaving.

511
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Be obedient.

512
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Why am I so easy to make up?

513
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
Who said that?

514
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Every time you say something, I'm already made up by you.

515
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Enough.

516
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
The mission of Yuni House is

517
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
to let humans enjoy the beauty of their skin.

518
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
Beauty and White Water

519
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
is a basic care that star customers like Jianxi

520
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
must have every day.

521
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
So we selected

522
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Beauty and White Water, and selected mask set.

523
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Okay.

524
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

525
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Next, let's welcome

526
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
our guest of this event

527
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Miss Jianxi

528
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
to the stage.

529
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Let's welcome Miss Jianxi.

530
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
Jianxi.

531
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
I told you to come on stage.

532
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Okay.

533
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Mr. Dai.

534
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
May I ask why we invite Miss Jianxi

535
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
to be our guest

536
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
in this new product launch?

537
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Because Yuni House is an online company

538
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
that displays the data of our 10 million

539
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
consumers.

540
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Miss Jianxi is our

541
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
favorite female star.

542
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
So the consumers chose Jianxi.

543
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Okay. Thank you for your speech.

544
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Next, let's welcome

545
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
our friends in the media to take a photo with us.

546
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Miss Jianxi, be happy.

547
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Look here.

548
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Look closer.

549
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Look here.

550
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Jianxi.

551
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Mr. Dai.

552
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Mr. Dai, I have something urgent.

553
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Jianxi.

554
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
The event is just half done.

555
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Next, we will have a group dinner.

556
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
We will have dinner with sponsors.

557
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Mr. Dai, I'm sorry. I can't go.

558
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Jianxi.

559
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I have to do everything to invite them to the stage.

560
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
You can't miss it.

561
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Jianxi, if you have something to do,

562
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
you can go first. We will go later.

563
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Thank you.

564
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Goodbye, Mr. Dai.

565
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
I'm sorry, friends in the media.

566
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
I have to go first.

567
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
What are you thinking about?

568
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
It's the second time.

569
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
What do you mean?

570
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
This is the second time she gives up her job for Tang Fei.

571
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Lu Zhuang.

572
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
You are so beautiful.

573
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
I'm sure every piece of your beauty will be your life.

574
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Secondly, you are the most beautiful girl in the world.

575
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
It's been four months since I left.

576
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
You are both so busy.

577
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,120
I haven't seen you for a long time.

578
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Why didn't you call her?

579
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
She took a very important role.

580
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
Today, San'er has a press conference.

581
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Let's have a press conference.

582
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
I've already had four cups of coffee.

583
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
There's another cup. Don't waste it.

584
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
I'm sorry, miss. This is the VIP lounge.

585
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
It's okay. We know each other.

586
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Why did you come here in this dress?

587
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
What about the event?

588
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Don't tell me

589
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
you won't even give me a endorsement in the future.

590
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Because you are more important.

591
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
I know.

592
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm sorry.

593
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
An Jianba.

594
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm leaving.

595
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
After I go there, make sure

596
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
to call me every day.

597
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Only one? Can I call three?

598
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Okay.

599
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Let's call five.

600
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Eight. Ten.

601
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Okay.

602
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
How about this?

603
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
I'll give you a video when I'm free.

604
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
I'll give you a video when I'm free.

605
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Go back.

606
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Come.

607
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Are you angry?

608
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
I'm sorry.

609
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
I'm sorry.

610
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Teacher.

611
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
I'm sorry.

612
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
It's okay.

613
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
You can go back.

614
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Teacher.

615
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
You can go back.

616
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
I...I did delay my work.

617
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Because Tang Fei is going to perform abroad.

618
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
I want to see him off.

619
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
I didn't blame you.

620
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
I know you're angry.

621
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Go away.

622
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Don't bother me here.

623
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
Let's go.

624
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Let's go.

625
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
Teacher. I know you're angry.

626
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
I didn't go through your approval.

627
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
I left in advance.

628
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
Do you think that's why?

629
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
You still didn't realize your mistake.

630
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Teacher.

631
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
I'm an ordinary person.

632
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I want to have a normal life.

633
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Normal life?

634
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
Yes.

635
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
I'm an ordinary person.

636
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
But you always want me to work.

637
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
I'm not a robot.

638
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Are you resisting me?

639
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
I didn't mean that.

640
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Since the day you chose this profession,

641
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
you're not qualified

642
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,120
to live an ordinary life.

643
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
You want to live an ordinary life?

644
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Okay.

645
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Then you want to return the glory to you.

646
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Lu Zhou. Teacher.

647
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
Are you too harsh on me?

648
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
I think he's not wrong.

649
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
You think he's not wrong?

650
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
You threw away a lot of fans and reporters.

651
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
Even the factory is confused.

652
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
You really think you're not wrong?

653
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Look.

654
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
Look at yourself in the mirror.

655
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
You're beautiful and beautiful.

656
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Is it easy for you to leave today?

657
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Jianxi.

658
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Many people think

659
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
you can't climb up anymore.

660
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
But you use your own behavior

661
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
to prove your ability.

662
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,120
But today,

663
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
you forgot your job

664
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
and dream for a man.

665
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Okay.

666
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
If Tang Fei can do it,

667
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
marry him right now.

668
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
Go. Marry him.

669
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Teacher, you're too much.

670
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
I did everything for your good.

671
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
For my good?

672
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
You want me to listen to you.

673
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

674
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Stop.

675
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Enough.

676
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
You think he's right, too?

677
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
I'm his agent.

678
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
I don't think he's wrong.

679
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
You're too greedy.

680
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
You're too extreme.

681
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
One day you'll understand

682
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
I do this to make him fly higher.

683
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,120
You'll only push him further.

684
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Jianxi.

685
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
I was too impulsive.

686
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Enough.

687
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
It's a big deal.

688
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
I think you did the right thing.

689
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
Although I'm your agent,

690
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,120
I should focus on your career.

691
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
But an agent can't be a tool for an actor.

692
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
You're human, too.

693
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Anxin.

694
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,120
And,

695
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,120
can you tell me in advance

696
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
what you're going to do?

697
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
You're so sudden.

698
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,120
Okay, I know.

699
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
I'll tell you in advance.

700
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Thank you.

701
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,120
We're family.

702
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,120
You should do your best

703
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
to return to the front line.

704
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
I'll try.

705
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,120
I'll make you the front line agent.

706
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,120
You're so loud.

707
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
I'm scared to death.

708
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Let's go home.

709
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Let's go.

710
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Anxin.

711
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Qin Wensun, what do you mean?

712
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
What do you mean?

713
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,120
I'm sorry.

714
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,120
I'm sorry.

715
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,120
I'm sorry.

716
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,120
You're the one who should be sorry.

717
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,120
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm sorry.

719
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
I'm sorry.

720
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
I'm sorry.

721
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
I'm sorry.

722
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
I'm sorry.

723
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,120
I'm sorry.

724
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,160
What do you mean?

725
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,760
You broke in so angrily.

726
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
What happened?

727
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,840
Why did you push Chen Ai Zhi Meng

728
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,240
who was supposed to find Jian Xi?

729
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,760
This is the company's unified arrangement.

730
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,400
Isn't there a lot of work in Jian Xi's hands?

731
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,360
It doesn't matter if you

732
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,520
make a movie like this.

733
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,920
Nonsense.

734
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,080
Chen Ai Zhi Meng is a famous

735
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,120
international director's work.

736
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,160
It can help Jian Xi quickly.

737
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,880
Why did you push her?

738
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,560
You're just fooling her.

739
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,760
Anxin.

740
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Let me finish.

741
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,480
After playing the role of De Ling and Rong Ling,

742
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,000
you could have received better resources.

743
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,400
But the company pushed you away

744
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,080
and made you take on

745
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,560
those messy commercial performances.

746
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,960
Qi Wen Sen, let me ask you.

747
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,520
Are you deliberately

748
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,560
controlling Jian Xi?

749
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,600
Anxin, what are you joking about?

750
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,920
Jian Xi is an actor from our company.

751
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,560
Why would I do that?

752
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,120
Do you really take Jian Xi

753
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,440
as your own actor?

754
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Why did you make her take on

755
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,800
these messy commercial performances?

756
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,000
She's in her prime.

757
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,920
You're going to hurt her.

758
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,120
I've said it.

759
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,680
This is the company's decision.

760
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,600
Are you done?

761
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,640
Please leave.

762
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,320
But I have to remind you.

763
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,480
If you break in again

764
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,640
without any rules,

765
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,800
don't blame me for being rude.

766
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,040
Get out!

767
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,640
Go.

768
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
I'm telling you, Qi Wen Sen.

769
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
I won't let you off.

770
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,000
Anxin.

771
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,120
Leave me alone.

772
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,280
Is it really useful to be so impulsive?

773
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,760
I'm really angry.

774
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,160
I finally got you a new agent

775
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,360
and they gave it to someone else.

776
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,560
It's too much.

777
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,480
Forget it.

778
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,520
Forget it?

779
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,200
If I just forget it,

780
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,080
I don't deserve

781
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,480
to be a professional agent.

782
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,720
Then tell me.

783
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,080
What should we do now?

784
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,160
Leave Gong Yu Le.

785
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,200
Forever.

786
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,880
Forever.

787
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,720
Mr. Cheng, long time no see.

788
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,640
Hello.

789
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,440
How are you?

790
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm fine.

791
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,920
I met Miss Jian Xi.

792
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,960
Am I more beautiful than before?

793
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,920
Much more.

794
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,000
Come on, please sit.

795
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,600
Thank you.

796
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,560
Come on, sit.

797
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,800
Miss Jian, this is my business card.

798
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,360
What would you like to order?

799
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,080
Give us two cups of black tea.

800
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,600
Okay.

801
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,240
Thank you.

802
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,880
You're welcome.

803
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,600
Mr. Cheng, we're old friends.

804
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,280
I'll just say it.

805
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:42,920
Okay.

806
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,080
If Jian Xi

807
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,480
is hired to Hai Yang,

808
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
what's the benefit of her career?

809
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,600
We've made a whole plan

810
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,840
for Jian Xi.

811
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,680
We promise to make a big movie every year

812
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,040
and a big TV series.

813
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,920
Are you satisfied with this?

814
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,160
But our contract period

815
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,000
is five years away.

816
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,480
Don't worry about it.

817
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
We'll pay

818
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,480
all her contract fees.

819
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,600
What's the point of staying in the public entertainment?

820
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,520
Everyone knows

821
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,320
that Ji Qing is the only one

822
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,120
who is well-respected in the company.

823
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,080
She's the one who gives her the best resources.

824
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,200
Jian Xi is so excellent.

825
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,520
The company hasn't planned for her at all.

826
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,200
Qi Wen Sen

827
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
often cusses at the resources

828
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,280
that Jian Xi already has.

829
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,840
I've never heard of

830
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,840
a company that's so biased.

831
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,560
An Xi.

832
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,360
I think

833
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,880
I should wait until the contract is full.

834
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,960
The contract is full?

835
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,800
Are you going to be used by Qi Wen Sen

836
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,280
to get the last bit of the value?

837
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
You're a rising actress.

838
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,360
Tell me.

839
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,160
How many years are there left?

840
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,360
Jian Xi.

841
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,560
I think Mr. Cheng is right.

842
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,680
An Xi.

843
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,840
How about this, Mr. Cheng?

844
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,280
Let's go back and think about it

845
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,520
and give you an answer, okay?

846
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,120
No problem.

847
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,320
Okay.

848
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,120
I'll wait for your good news.

849
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,960
Please come here in person.

850
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,880
I'm sorry.

851
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,440
Okay.

852
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,120
Take care.

853
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,880
Okay. Goodbye.

854
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,760
An Xi.

855
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,240
I think

856
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,200
we should wait until the contract is full.

857
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,240
The contract is full?

858
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,160
After the contract is full,

859
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,360
the company will only give you

860
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,640
all the resources.

861
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,080
Qi Wen Sen will continue to

862
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,960
give you those useless commercial performances.

863
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,840
What did they do

864
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,640
when they got the bad news?

865
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,640
They only know how to push the waves.

866
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,960
Jian Xi.

867
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,080
If you continue to

868
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,120
follow the waves,

869
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,360
you will ruin your future.

870
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,120
So you mean

871
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,160
to terminate the contract with Qi Wen Sen now?

872
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,720
Yes.

873
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,480
And don't worry about that.

874
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,400
If they can't do it,

875
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,960
I'll prepare a Chinese and Asian company for you.

876
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,840
These are big companies with strength.

877
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,240
They will definitely value you.

878
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,920
Okay.

879
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,040
Don't worry.

880
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,680
Don't worry.

881
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,720
Don't worry.

882
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,760
Termination of contract?

883
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,440
Termination of contract.

884
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,560
If I remember correctly,

885
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,160
the contract will expire in five years.

886
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,000
I know.

887
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,840
Jian Xi is popular now.

888
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,600
She has a lot of contracts.

889
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,400
But in my company,

890
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,160
only those who are full of contracts will expire.

891
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,320
No actor will quit on time.

892
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,520
Don't worry.

893
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,640
We will pay the termination fee.

894
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,360
What if I don't agree?

895
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,920
Everyone is in this circle.

896
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,960
You can't see it, you can't see it.

897
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,880
It's easy to get rid of it.

898
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,320
Then there will be a chance to cooperate.

899
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,040
That's it.

900
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,000
If you really don't want to agree,

901
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,040
we'll have to meet in court.

902
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,640
Your company doesn't value Jian Xi anyway.

903
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,400
It's meaningless to keep her.

904
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
Anxin,

905
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,520
I always thought

906
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,000
you were an experienced agent.

907
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,680
But today I think

908
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,240
your brain seems to have a problem.

909
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
You actually will make actors

910
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,240
do such stupid things.

911
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,880
I've been in this business for so long.

912
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,000
I've never seen a boss

913
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
who is so stingy like you.

914
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
Since you are heartless,

915
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,360
we have to do this.

916
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,640
That means

917
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,000
you have decided

918
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,800
to break up with me?

919
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,200
You can think so.

920
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Jian Xi can terminate the contract.

921
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,400
But she has to pay the termination fee.

922
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,600
She has to complete

923
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,880
the contract on time.

924
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Of course.

925
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,800
If there's nothing else,

926
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,320
I'll leave first, Boss Qi.

927
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Don't worry.

928
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,800
I'll go back and ask

929
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,960
the producers I know.

930
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,560
I'll ask if they have a suitable role for you.

931
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,520
What are you doing?

932
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,680
Teacher.

933
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,760
Why don't you discuss

934
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,760
such a big thing with me?

935
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,320
I'm Jian Xi's agent.

936
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,120
I have the right to deal with all her affairs.

937
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,320
You're not doing this for her.

938
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,400
You're hurting her.

939
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,040
I'm hurting her?

940
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,680
Do you know that

941
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,120
after she finished playing

942
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,320
Deling and Rong Lin,

943
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,440
the company rejected

944
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,000
all her movie activities

945
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,240
and only allowed her to take on

946
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,280
some commercial performances?

947
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,960
You and I both know that.

948
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,040
But you can't do that.

949
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,240
You and I both know that.

950
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,720
If we continue like this,

951
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,600
we'll only waste

952
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,520
our hard-earned money.

953
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,240
Teacher.

954
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,280
The conflict between Qi Wen Sen and I

955
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,360
is already very deep.

956
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,800
There's really no way to resolve it.

957
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,400
Do you think I don't know?

958
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,560
But you're taking action without permission.

959
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,280
You'll anger the company.

960
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,360
So what?

961
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,200
Look at the newspaper.

962
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,760
Look at what the newspaper said today.

963
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,320
The company has officially issued a statement.

964
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,760
It has never suppressed Jian Xi.

965
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,040
And it has arranged

966
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,280
all important jobs for her.

967
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,200
It's just because

968
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,560
it's involved in the confidentiality agreement.

969
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,000
It has never been released.

970
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,000
This time,

971
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,440
it's because Jian Xi's extreme lack of cooperation

972
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,600
has caused serious losses.

973
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,680
So,

974
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,200
the company has made a single-use agreement

975
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,400
to pursue the violation of the contract and compensation.

976
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,480
Of course I know that I have to compensate.

977
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,680
So I've already found the Xia family.

978
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,880
Xia family?

979
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,160
How can a company that has no strength

980
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,720
take on this matter?

981
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,160
Anxin.

982
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,160
I advise you not to play with yourself.

983
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,320
They are not easy to mess with.

984
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,400
I've been an agent for so long.

985
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,200
I don't need you to tell me

986
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,560
what I should do.

987
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,560
Fine.

988
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,960
From now on,

989
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,840
you are not Jian Xi's agent.

990
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,880
Why do you always

991
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,320
influence other people's thoughts?

992
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,080
Because you are invited by me.

993
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,040
Then you have to ask Jian Xi

994
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,880
if she is willing to do it.

995
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,560
Jian Xi.

996
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,960
You choose.

997
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,640
Jian Xi.

998
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,440
You can't stay there.

999
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,680
If you stay there,

1000
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,200
it's a waste of youth.

1001
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,840
Do you know that?

1002
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,400
Jian Xi.

1003
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,240
All the decisions I made

1004
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,520
are for your own good.

1005
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,120
I'm sorry.

1006
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm sorry.

1007
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,920
I'm sorry.

1008
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
I'm sorry.

1009
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
I'm sorry.

1010
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,920
I'm sorry.

1011
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
I'm sorry.

1012
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
I'm sorry.

1013
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
I'm sorry.

1014
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
I'm sorry.

1015
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,920
I'm sorry.

1016
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920
I'm sorry.

1017
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,920
I'm sorry.

1018
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
I'm sorry.

1019
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm sorry.

1020
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920
I'm sorry.

1021
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
I'm sorry.

1022
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
I'm sorry.

1023
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
I'm sorry.

1024
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,920
I'm sorry.

1025
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
I'm sorry.

1026
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
I'm sorry.

1027
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm sorry.

1028
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
I'm sorry.

1029
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
I'm sorry.

1030
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
I'm sorry.

1031
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
I'm sorry.

1032
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
I'm sorry.

1033
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
I'm sorry.

1034
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
I'm sorry.

1035
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
I'm sorry.

1036
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
I'm sorry.

1037
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
I'm sorry.

1038
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
I'm sorry.

1039
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
I'm sorry.

1040
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
I'm sorry.

1041
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,920
I'm sorry.

1042
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
I'm sorry.

1043
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
I'm sorry.

1044
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
I'm sorry.

1045
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
I'm sorry.

1046
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
I'm sorry.

1047
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
I'm sorry.

1048
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
I'm sorry.

1049
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,920
I'm sorry.

1050
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,920
I'm sorry.

1051
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,920
I'm sorry.

1052
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,920
I'm sorry.

1053
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,920
I'm sorry.

1054
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,920
I'm sorry.

1055
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
I'm sorry.

1056
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,920
I'm sorry.

1057
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,920
I'm sorry.

1058
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
I'm sorry.

1059
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
I'm sorry.

1060
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
I'm sorry.

1061
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,920
I'm sorry.

1062
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
I'm sorry.

1063
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
I'm sorry.

1064
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,920
I'm sorry.

1065
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,920
I'm sorry.

1066
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,920
I'm sorry.

1067
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
I'm sorry.

1068
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
I'm sorry.

1069
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
I'm sorry.

1070
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
I'm sorry.

1071
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,920
I'm sorry.

1072
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,920
I'm sorry.

1073
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
I'm sorry.

1074
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
I'm sorry.

1075
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
I'm sorry.

1076
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,920
I'm sorry.

1077
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
I'm sorry.

1078
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,920
