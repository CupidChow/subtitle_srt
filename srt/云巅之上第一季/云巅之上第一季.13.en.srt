1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
You will be jealous of me

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Strange eyes look at me

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't have to care about breathing

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,480
Go down your own path

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,640
Your beauty will soon be frozen

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,120
I don't want

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't want

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,920
I don't want to deceive myself

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,280
Miss you, love you, and love you

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,720
I don't care who is more beautiful

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,120
At that moment, in the second year

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I will be a magical eye

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,760
Pass through the loneliness to find you

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,960
Put on the most solid gold armor

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Hold the weapon in your hand

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Use all your strength to fight for the most real you

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
No matter what the little tricks

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
No matter what rumors

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,000
I will definitely be invincible

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't want you to be willing

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,640
Where is the gold?

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,360
In the past, I kept the sweetness

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,680
No matter where your heart is

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,000
My heart is here

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
Even if the world is invincible

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,880
I'm only one you

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,400
Here, Miss Lulu

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,800
No matter where your heart is

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,080
I will definitely be invincible

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,880
Yes, Miss Lulu

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,880
It is all very real

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,240
I'm just distraught

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,960
Okay

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,080
Here is medicine

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,960
Yes, Miss Lulu

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,800
Unwilling up?

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
He should be very nervous.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Why should he be nervous?

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
You don't know?

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Many people say that

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
if Lu Zhou is not injured,

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
he is the most capable actor.

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Do you think he will mind?

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
But he hasn't acted for a long time.

45
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Can he?

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Of course he can.

47
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
I don't believe that

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
you didn't treat him

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
as your idol.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Look, Lu Zhou is so handsome.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
So handsome.

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
So handsome.

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
He is so handsome.

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
He is so handsome.

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Director.

56
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Lu Zhou, you changed your clothes.

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
How is it?

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Do you like the shoes?

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
No problem.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
As long as you don't run around,

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
it's okay.

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Lu Zhou, we all support you.

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
It's all on you.

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Okay, I will do my best.

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Okay, get ready.

66
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Let's start.

67
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Come on.

68
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Get ready.

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
How are you preparing?

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Relax.

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Remember the position.

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Don't be too stiff.

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Come on.

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Remember.

75
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Although you are

76
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
the passers-by,

77
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
you should be emotional.

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Don't be too stiff.

79
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Otherwise, the scene will be too bad.

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
We will understand.

81
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Teacher, come on.

82
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Come on.

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
There seems to be a problem.

84
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
It's really not good.

85
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
You said he is not good.

86
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Don't you think he is your godfather?

87
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
No.

88
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
He hasn't stood in front of the camera for a long time.

89
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
He is nervous.

90
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Are you ready?

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Yes.

92
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Action.

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
How is the girl?

94
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
She is okay.

95
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Is she interested in you?

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
She has a small problem.

97
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
It's inevitable.

98
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
If you need help,

99
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
just tell me.

100
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Okay.

101
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Everything is fine now.

102
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Wait until this is done.

103
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Next time.

104
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Be careful.

105
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Be careful.

106
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Sir, I am waiting for someone.

107
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
I am waiting for someone too.

108
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Then why are you sitting here?

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Please change a table.

110
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Miss,

111
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
it's very rude to say that.

112
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Keep quiet.

113
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Have you seen the man across the street?

114
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
He is my father's sworn brother.

115
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Be careful.

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
I will.

117
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
He should be my uncle.

118
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
But

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
they betrayed my father.

120
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
They made him cross the street.

121
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I am here to avenge.

122
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I will kill him later.

123
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
This is a common thing in the palace.

124
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
You can't escape.

125
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
So,

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
I want you to help me.

127
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Come on.

128
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Go.

129
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Thank you for your help.

130
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Did you see that?

131
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
He was really...

132
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
It was so scary.

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Why are you so gossipy?

134
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Jianxi is playing that role.

135
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Of course it's scary.

136
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
You are stupid.

137
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
I didn't say Jianxi.

138
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I said Lu Zhou.

139
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Since he appeared,

140
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
he has taken away everyone's light.

141
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Look.

142
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
There is only one sentence.

143
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
One sentence.

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Gu Yun Sheng killed his enemy in the cafe.

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Yu Ao Jun saw it.

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
He has no words.

147
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
The light is so bright.

148
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
The man is so good.

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Didn't you see that?

150
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
He didn't only act alone.

151
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
He wanted everyone to understand it.

152
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
And act together.

153
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
And then?

154
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
No.

155
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I mean he is not your god of men.

156
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
My god of men is you.

157
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
God of men,

158
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
let go of your hand.

159
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Okay. Cut.

160
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Great, Lu Zhou.

161
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
I haven't seen such an exciting performance for a long time.

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
You are really Lu Zhou.

163
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Good.

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Tang Fei.

165
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Learn from teacher Lu.

166
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Your play is so good.

167
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Jianxi.

168
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Yu Ao Jun is cold and cold.

169
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
He is so cold.

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
You were a little too scared just now.

171
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Teacher.

172
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
At that moment,

173
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
I thought you were going to kill me.

174
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I was so scared.

175
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I will go to Anxin.

176
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Don't avoid me.

177
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I don't care.

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I will be in the group tomorrow.

179
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Today,

180
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
come and say hello.

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Welcome.

182
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I won't lose to you.

183
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
From now on,

184
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
you have to work hard.

185
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I will.

186
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
I will.

187
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
I will.

188
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
I will.

189
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I will.

190
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
You are here.

191
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Come to test the micro.

192
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Xia Zhan Shu.

193
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Xia Zhan Shu?

194
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Lu Zhou.

195
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Where is Jianxi?

196
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
She is in a bad mood.

197
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Let her be alone for a while.

198
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Because of the love?

199
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Anxin, I tell you.

200
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
There are some things

201
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
that must be faced.

202
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Otherwise,

203
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
never want to solve it.

204
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Is this too cruel?

205
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Don't you want her to be the top?

206
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
But...

207
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
If you want her to be the top,

208
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
feelings are burden.

209
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I am not afraid.

210
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
I am not afraid.

211
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Jianxi,

212
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
tonight at ten o'clock,

213
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I will wait for you in the restaurant.

214
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Tang Fei, I...

215
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I have something to tell you.

216
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Anyway, I can't see you.

217
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
I won't leave.

218
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Tang Fei.

219
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Tang Fei asked you to meet.

220
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Tonight.

221
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Then we have to act tonight.

222
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
You forgot.

223
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Teacher.

224
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Jianxi.

225
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:42,920
Business and love can't be

226
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,800
between two sides.

227
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
You are now

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
going step by step.

229
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
If you make a decision

230
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
impulsively now,

231
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
it will not benefit

232
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
you both.

233
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
But...

234
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
But you are sad, right?

235
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Give time.

236
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Time will make you

237
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
forget everything.

238
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
You look now

239
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
so heavy

240
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
that you can't be heavy anymore.

241
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
After you think about it,

242
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
it may be just like this.

243
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Moreover,

244
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
you just met Tang Fei.

245
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
You are not very close yet.

246
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
It is the most wise choice

247
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
to break up now.

248
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Okay.

249
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Wash your face and put on makeup.

250
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
You look pale now.

251
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I...

252
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Be good.

253
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
How is it?

254
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Not bad, right?

255
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Didn't you say you wanted to meet

256
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
a producer?

257
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Sit down first.

258
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Sit down for a while.

259
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
The producer

260
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
hasn't come yet.

261
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Drink some wine first.

262
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Talk to a beauty.

263
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Look at this.

264
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
All are beauties.

265
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
They are all the type you like.

266
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
They are elegant.

267
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
You are sick.

268
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Take a look first.

269
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
But they are all beauties.

270
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Brother Fei.

271
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Brother Fei.

272
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Brother Fei.

273
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Brother Fei.

274
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Hi.

275
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
This is...

276
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Hello.

277
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
You forgot who I am.

278
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I took a photo with you before.

279
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
You are...

280
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
I am Diana.

281
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Do you remember me?

282
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Okay.

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You two drink some wine.

284
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I will go get another bottle.

285
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Okay.

286
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
The manager called me today.

287
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I thought it was a joke.

288
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
He really invited you here.

289
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Tonight,

290
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
we have time.

291
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Sorry.

292
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Excuse me.

293
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
We need to work harder.

294
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Tang Fei.

295
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Sorry.

296
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Tang Fei.

297
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Tang Fei.

298
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Tang Fei.

299
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Can you please let me do this?

300
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
This is not for you.

301
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
You didn't bring me here to meet the producer, right?

302
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Yes.

303
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
You saw it.

304
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
So many beauties.

305
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Which one is not better than Jian Xi?

306
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
You...

307
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
What?

308
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Give it back to me.

309
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
This...

310
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
You need to remember that you are an agent.

311
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
An amazing agent.

312
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Not a shrew.

313
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Okay, I know.

314
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
I can't control your emotional life.

315
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
But you are delaying your work.

316
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I am not.

317
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
You are.

318
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Who is the one who is in front of Jian Xi?

319
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Not you?

320
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
I know you are very professional.

321
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
But if it's not Jian Xi,

322
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
will you still fight for the position?

323
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
You won't.

324
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Give me the key.

325
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Tang Fei, I beg you to change it.

326
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
If you don't like emotional life,

327
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
you are not the one.

328
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Okay.

329
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Okay, I will listen to you.

330
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Open the door.

331
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Tang Fei.

332
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
What are you doing?

333
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Open the door.

334
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Open the door.

335
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
What should I do?

336
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Yu Yaojun is a man of both color and appearance.

337
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
He is cold and cold.

338
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
In his bones,

339
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,800
he is also wearing the stubbornness and stubbornness of the new generation of women.

340
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Your style is just like a god.

341
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
You lack the real godly will.

342
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
The first time he met Shen Lan,

343
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,800
he wanted to suppress the opponent he had never met before.

344
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
At the same time, he was also in the image of a girl.

345
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
In such a complicated situation,

346
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
he was able to see the true feelings.

347
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Jian Xi,

348
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
how do you think this role should be interpreted?

349
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Jian Xi.

350
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Is there anything wrong?

351
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I may be a little tired.

352
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
If you are tired,

353
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
go home and rest.

354
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
By the way,

355
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
I have a detailed CD here.

356
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
I will play it for you.

357
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Maybe it will be of help to you to interpret this role.

358
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Are you not feeling well?

359
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Hello, is this Ji Qing?

360
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Ji Qing?

361
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Mr. Tang,

362
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
are you not going to order?

363
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Let's practice for a while, okay?

364
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Okay.

365
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Why are you here?

366
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Teacher, I have something to do. I'm leaving.

367
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Jian Xi.

368
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Jian Xi.

369
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Let her go first.

370
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
What do you know?

371
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
I don't understand.

372
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I really don't understand.

373
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
I don't understand why you always set a trap for her.

374
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
She is not suitable to be in love now, do you know?

375
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
This will affect her career.

376
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
You are her manager.

377
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
You should know this better than anyone else.

378
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
I am her manager.

379
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Even if it affects me,

380
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
what does it have to do with you?

381
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Lu Zhou, I don't understand.

382
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Is this because you care about her

383
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
or because you are selfish?

384
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Do you know what you are saying?

385
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Do you know what you are doing?

386
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
I care more about her career than anyone else.

387
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Even more than myself.

388
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
But do you know what she really needs?

389
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Have you ever cared about her heart?

390
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Teacher, please wait a moment.

391
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
I will give you the book.

392
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Miss, please go.

393
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
I will pay you later.

394
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
It's okay.

395
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Thank you, teacher.

396
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Sorry, I am late.

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
I didn't come late on purpose.

398
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
I am talking about the script.

399
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Do you hate me that much?

400
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
You are so anxious to push me out, right?

401
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
You don't come, so you don't come.

402
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Why do you want to inform Ji Qing?

403
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Ji Qing?

404
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
To be honest,

405
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I really want to talk to you tonight.

406
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
But you are like this.

407
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
What do you think of me?

408
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I am telling you,

409
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I am just a big joke tonight.

410
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Jin Xi, I am so happy for you.

411
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
I really rushed here after talking about the script.

412
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I don't know about Ji Qing's situation here.

413
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
You have to believe me.

414
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Tang Fei.

415
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Let me go.

416
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
What are you doing?

417
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Can you be with Lu Zhou?

418
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I have Anxin when talking about the script.

419
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Don't mention Anxin to me.

420
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
What are you thinking?

421
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Why do you say that to teacher?

422
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Teacher Lu,

423
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
she has nothing to do with this.

424
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Do you think she is just as simple as your teacher?

425
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Is she really simple?

426
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Or is she pretending to be simple?

427
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
You can't see it yourself.

428
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
She wants to take all your time

429
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
to find all kinds of reasons.

430
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Let you stay away from me.

431
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Why?

432
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
She likes you.

433
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
She wants to occupy you.

434
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
What are you talking about?

435
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Impossible.

436
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Obviously,

437
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
between me and her,

438
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
you choose to believe her more.

439
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I didn't mean that.

440
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
But what you are saying is ridiculous.

441
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
It's impossible for a teacher to like me.

442
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I believe what you are saying more and more.

443
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
What?

444
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
You never loved me.

445
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Or you are too cheap to love me.

446
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Lu Zhou,

447
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
you just say whatever you want.

448
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
You will leave right away.

449
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
This has nothing to do with me.

450
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Don't pretend to be innocent.

451
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
It's late.

452
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
You want to go home?

453
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Let me see you out.

454
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Let me open the door for you.

455
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Tang Fei.

456
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Come.

457
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
I...

458
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Please.

459
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Tang Fei.

460
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Shut up.

461
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Thanks.

462
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Why do you...

463
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Can't it be me?

464
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Tang Fei.

465
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Everyone has their own unique unique point.

466
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
I won't compare with Jiang Xi.

467
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
But

468
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
I hope you'll give me a chance.

469
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Remember?

470
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Ji Xing, actually, I don't...

471
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I know.

472
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
You were so good to me before.

473
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
It's because of guilt.

474
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
But one day,

475
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
I will turn them into love.

476
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
I hope this day

477
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
won't make me wait too long.

478
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
I really don't want you to waste time on me.

479
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
That's all I want to say.

480
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Good night.

481
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Good night.

482
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Jiang Xin, Tang Fei.

483
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
This scene is from the theater

484
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
after you read the script.

485
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
You met the Japanese.

486
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Their words and behavior are too much.

487
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Tang Fei taught them a lesson

488
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
in the situation.

489
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
After this scene,

490
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
your relationship is now better.

491
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Jiang Xin,

492
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
someone will throw a bottle at you.

493
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
But don't worry.

494
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
That bottle is fake.

495
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
It's okay.

496
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I understand.

497
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Okay.

498
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Get ready.

499
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Okay, tell me.

500
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Get ready.

501
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
We will start filming.

502
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Don't you think

503
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
they are acting weird?

504
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Nothing.

505
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Nothing?

506
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Isn't it good?

507
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
They were together yesterday.

508
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
They should have made up.

509
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
I don't know.

510
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
You don't know?

511
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
You are his agent.

512
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
How can you not know?

513
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
You are so ungrateful.

514
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Aren't you his agent?

515
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
I'm not lying under his bed.

516
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
How can I know?

517
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Aren't you living with Tang Fei?

518
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
How can you not know?

519
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Don't talk nonsense.

520
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
I'm working.

521
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm working late at night.

522
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Work.

523
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Tell me the truth.

524
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Are you secretly in love with Tang Fei?

525
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Me?

526
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I know it.

527
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
I know it.

528
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
No.

529
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
This is the filming site.

530
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
It's your business.

531
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I wish you happiness.

532
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Are you ready?

533
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Yes, director.

534
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Okay.

535
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Ready.

536
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Action.

537
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Boss, do you want a car?

538
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Okay.

539
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
You can't leave.

540
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Check the route.

541
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Isn't this the dancer of the capital?

542
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Why is she a woman?

543
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
What do you want?

544
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
She has a nice beard.

545
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Go away.

546
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
What are you doing?

547
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Go away.

548
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Let go.

549
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Boss.

550
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Beat him.

551
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Beat him.

552
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Okay. Cut.

553
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Your arm is bleeding.

554
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
It's okay.

555
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
How is it?

556
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Are you okay?

557
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
It's bleeding.

558
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
What should we do now?

559
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
It's useless to fight.

560
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Where's the knife?

561
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Go back.

562
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I told you it's okay.

563
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Wait.

564
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Tang Fei.

565
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
I think you have a serious injury.

566
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Let's go to the hospital.

567
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
No need.

568
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Just a little bandage.

569
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
This actor is really...

570
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
He just did it.

571
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
He just did it.

572
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
He really hit him.

573
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
All new people are like this.

574
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
What's the big deal?

575
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Which one is this?

576
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
You can disinfect with a little wine.

577
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Then wipe it with double-edged water.

578
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Wait a minute. I have to see.

579
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
The wound is going to be salt-reduced.

580
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Let me do it.

581
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
What's wrong?

582
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
I go in?

583
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
No.

584
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
What's wrong with you?

585
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
You are usually very careful when shooting.

586
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
And I heard that

587
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
you could have avoided it just now.

588
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Tang Fei.

589
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Qi Qing is talking to you.

590
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm fine.

591
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
It's nothing.

592
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
You should be more careful in the future.

593
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Start working.

594
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Tang Fei.

595
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Tang Fei.

596
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Tang Fei.

597
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Wait a minute.

598
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Can you do this?

599
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
It's my turn.

600
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Later,

601
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Shen Lan will play the role of Yu Yao Jun

602
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
who wants to terminate the engagement with you.

603
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
Qi Qing, you just joined the team.

604
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Do you want to play with Tang Fei?

605
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
No need.

606
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
You are so confident.

607
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
I'm confident.

608
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Okay.

609
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
It's up to you two.

610
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Get ready.

611
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
One shot, one kill.

612
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Ready.

613
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Start.

614
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Yao Yin.

615
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
I won't marry you.

616
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
I love Yao Jun.

617
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Brother Lan.

618
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Since my mother took me in,

619
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm your wife.

620
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
But that's what mother meant.

621
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I never really agreed.

622
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
When I first came,

623
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
I didn't know the words.

624
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Do you remember?

625
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Why?

626
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Under the calm sea,

627
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
there is a fierce dark tide.

628
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
This is Feng Miao Yin that she understands.

629
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Feng Miao Yin is virtuous and virtuous.

630
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
He grew up in the Shen family.

631
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
He thinks he will marry Shen Lan.

632
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
But he didn't expect

633
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Shen Lan to be so different.

634
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
According to Feng Miao Yin's character,

635
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
the gentle resistance

636
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
is much better than the coldness of the coldness.

637
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Jian Xi.

638
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Yes?

639
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
How do you usually perform?

640
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
I...

641
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
I rely on inspiration.

642
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Up to now, your performance

643
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
is completely based on inspiration.

644
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Qi Qing is different from you.

645
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
You take a good look.

646
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
You take a good look

647
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
at how he thinks about the role.

648
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Use acting to move others.

649
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
In order to be with you,

650
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
I study every day.

651
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I never stop.

652
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Until now,

653
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
I can help you practice new opera.

654
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Miao Yin.

655
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
I know you are a very virtuous and good woman.

656
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
It's just that I love you.

657
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
It's good.

658
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
If you are willing,

659
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I want to help you find

660
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
a better husband than me.

661
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
In order to be worthy of you,

662
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I not only have to be a housekeeper,

663
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
but also learn to make a wedding robe.

664
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
I did all of this for you.

665
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
So,

666
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
I will not leave.

667
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Miao Yin.

668
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Even if I die,

669
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
I am still the daughter-in-law of the Shen family.

670
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Good.

671
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Stop.

672
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Jin Xing, you did well.

673
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Thank you.

674
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
I am so touched.

675
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
I am so touched.

676
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
You are so kind.

677
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I think this scene

678
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
can be handled like this.

679
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Yu Yao Jun was covered by Feng Miao Yin.

680
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
You are the heroine of this play.

681
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Why did this happen?

682
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
That's because

683
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
you didn't catch the soul of this character.

684
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Soul?

685
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Think about it again.

686
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
A girl who wants to

687
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
create a new world

688
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
in the world of men.

689
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
What kind of person is she?

690
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Yu Yao Jun.

691
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
The real Yu Yao Jun.

692
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Yu Yao Jun.

693
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
The real Yu Yao Jun.

694
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I will make up for you later.

695
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Okay.

696
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
What kind of person is she?

697
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
She didn't even say hello.

698
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
It's not like that.

699
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Then what is it?

700
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Is this...

701
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Is this Yu Yao Jun?

702
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Ready.

703
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Start.

704
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
How is my mother today?

705
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Much better.

706
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
I will visit her tomorrow.

707
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
I will talk about Jin Xing's feelings.

708
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
No need.

709
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Mother, she...

710
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
is very kind.

711
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I will do it.

712
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
What's wrong?

713
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
I just want to help you.

714
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Everyone says that

715
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Yu Yao Jun has a deep voice.

716
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,800
He is a man who lives on stage.

717
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
I didn't expect

718
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
that he has such a soft voice

719
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
under the stage.

720
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I just opened my voice,

721
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
everyone knew that I was a woman.

722
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
If I heard the second line,

723
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
I would have forgotten about this tea.

724
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
But no matter how good I sing,

725
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
I am still a woman.

726
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
If I really look like an old man,

727
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
it's not worth it.

728
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Jin Xing, drink some water.

729
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
This is the real Yu Yao Jun.

730
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
He looks cold,

731
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
honest,

732
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
and very emotional.

733
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Otherwise,

734
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
how can Shen Lan fall in love with him?

735
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
You are too into the play.

736
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
But

737
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
I will not lose to him.

738
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Open your eyes wide, open your back,

739
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,800
and look at the world.

740
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,800
The moon and the moon shine

741
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,800
in the sky.

742
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
The sun and the moon shine

743
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
in the sky.

744
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
The moon and the moon shine

745
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
in the sky.

746
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
The sun and the moon shine

747
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
in the sky.

748
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
The moon and the moon shine

749
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
in the sky.

750
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
The sun and the moon shine

751
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
in the sky.

752
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
The moon and the moon shine

753
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
in the sky.

754
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Good!

755
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Good!

756
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Good!

757
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Gu Da Shao is so generous.

758
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
The Yellow River is pouring water.

759
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
He is treating you as the three people who donated money.

760
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Good!

761
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Good!

762
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Cut!

763
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Is it a illusion?

764
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
I think those four people

765
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
seemed to have a strange aura.

766
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Ji Qing didn't say anything.

767
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
But I don't know why,

768
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
but I feel that the power of the micro-sphere is so heavy.

769
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I was out of breath just now.

770
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
I was sweating because of the cut.

771
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Ji Qing,

772
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
you were so great just now.

773
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
You shook the whole scene

774
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
without saying a word.

775
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
The real important thing is

776
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
the next scene.

777
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Which scene did you play today?

778
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Shen Mu didn't agree to let Shen Lan marry Ao Jun.

779
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Shen Lan had to do the wedding in a low tone.

780
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Then, Feng You Yin was the one who played Shen Mu's death.

781
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Ao Jun went to the door to perform a show.

782
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
A show about love and affection?

783
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Yes.

784
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
That's wonderful.

785
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Look at you.

786
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Mr. Fu Zhuang, come here.

787
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Here.

788
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Let me help you.

789
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Brother Fei, let me help you.

790
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Okay.

791
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Look at you.

792
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
It seems that they are going to fight.

793
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
They are both lovers and enemies.

794
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
They are also competitors.

795
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
This scene is wonderful.

796
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Tang Fei.

797
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
You are just playing.

798
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Today is your important scene.

799
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Here is the thing.

800
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Shen Lan and Yu Ao Jun are in love.

801
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
But they can't get their mother's approval.

802
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
They can only get married secretly outside the mansion.

803
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,800
And Yu Ao Jun must have suffered a lot.

804
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Feng You Yin insisted on serving Shen Mu.

805
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,800
The conflict between the two people was very strong.

806
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Today is Shen Mu's funeral.

807
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,800
It is also the most intense place in our film.

808
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Please.

809
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Miss Yu, please wait.

810
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
My mother died and my daughter-in-law was discharged.

811
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Why did you stop me?

812
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
It was ordered by Young Mistress.

813
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
There is only one young master in the Shen family.

814
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Shen Lan also has only one wife.

815
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
Where did Young Mistress come from?

816
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
My family is the Young Mistress.

817
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm sorry, Miss Yu.

818
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Please go back.

819
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Please let Shen Lan out.

820
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Young Master has been too sad and can't eat.

821
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
He can't take care of so much now.

822
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
My husband is not feeling well.

823
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
I have to go in and see him.

824
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Shen Lan.

825
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
I am Ao Jun.

826
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
I am here to give my mother an award.

827
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Ao Jun.

828
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Shen Lan.

829
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Even a friend can go in and give the old lady an award.

830
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
But I can't even step in.

831
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,800
In your heart, what kind of person am I?

832
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Ao Jun.

833
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
You go in.

834
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
No.

835
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Miss Yu.

836
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
You can't go in this door.

837
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
Why?

838
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Today is the day my mother was sick.

839
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Even if I beg you.

840
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Let her go in peacefully.

841
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
I just went in and gave the old lady an award.

842
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Will she be unhappy?

843
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
You should know the reason.

844
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,800
I only know that my mother died and my son-in-law was killed.

845
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
Although I don't read much.

846
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
But I understand the reason.

847
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,800
My mother said that you are not allowed to enter this door for life.

848
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Even if everyone is my father.

849
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,800
I have to keep the last peace for her.

850
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,800
If I have to go in today.

851
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Do you want everyone to laugh at the Shen Family?

852
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Miaoyin.

853
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Lan Ge.

854
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,800
You can't make everyone happy.

855
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Life is simple.

856
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,800
But you can't write a word.

857
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Yu Ao Jun.

858
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
You have never been admitted by the Shen Family.

859
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Since you don't know your name.

860
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
You should stay in the side room.

861
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Come here to be mocked.

862
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,800
In the future.

863
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
You have no face to see people.

864
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Go back.

865
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Ridiculous.

866
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Really ridiculous.

867
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Shen Lan.

868
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
I have no comment on your marriage.

869
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,800
You used the red-flower sedan to bring me in.

870
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
I am now an unknown person.

871
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
I don't have parents' approval.

872
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Not unknown.

873
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
What is it?

874
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Miaoyin.

875
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Stop talking.

876
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Lan Ge.

877
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Ao Jun is the woman I love.

878
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
You shouldn't say that.

879
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,800
I only ask you one question.

880
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Today.

881
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
I will go in and burn incense for Madam.

882
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
To pay her respects.

883
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Will you give in or not?

884
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Give in.

885
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Let Ao Jun in.

886
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Who dares?

887
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Mother said.

888
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Yu Ao Jun is cold and cold.

889
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
He doesn't deserve to be a man.

890
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Even if he becomes a married man.

891
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
A woman like this.

892
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,800
He can never be buried in the ancestral tomb of the Shen Family.

893
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
Okay.

894
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
I will break in today.

895
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
If you dare to go in.

896
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,800
I will die in the coffin.

897
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Lan Ge.

898
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I did all this for my mother.

899
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
If there is any selfishness.

900
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
I beg you.

901
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Let mother go well.

902
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Lan Ge.

903
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Mother.

904
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Let's go.

905
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I regret.

906
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Ao Jun.

907
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Lan Ge.

908
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Lan Ge.

909
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Shen Lan.

910
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Everyone knows that I married you.

911
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Now mother is dead.

912
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
You don't keep your promise.

913
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I became a person with an unknown identity.

914
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
When I saw the loyalty and loyalty.

915
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Now it seems to be a young and ignorant.

916
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Stupid.

917
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Since it is like this.

918
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
From today.

919
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
From today.

920
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,800
I will not be with you.

921
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Yu Ao Jun.

922
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
You are crazy.

923
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
What do you mean by these?

924
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
People are rich.

925
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
I am rich.

926
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
There is justice in the world.

927
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
No need to say it today.

928
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Our love is strong.

929
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,800
You plan to abandon me like this?

930
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Lan Ge.

931
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Let him go.

932
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Yu Ao Jun.

933
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
You lost.

934
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
I will compensate you in the future.

935
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Don't worry.

936
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
I won't use a penny from you.

937
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
In the future.

938
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I will not sing opera.

939
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
I will not sing worse than you.

940
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
I will not marry.

941
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,800
I will not sing worse than you.

942
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Cut.

943
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Very good.

944
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Great.

945
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Jian Xi.

946
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
You are really great.

947
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
Thank you director.

948
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
See.

949
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
This is the real Yu Ao Jun.

950
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Not only cold on the outside.

951
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
The real Yu Ao Jun.

952
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Is like the red plum in the winter.

953
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
It is strong and strong.

954
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,800
Even if there is a thousand pains.

955
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
It is still strong.

956
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
It is still strong.

957
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Even if there is a thousand pains.

958
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
It is still strong.

959
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
It is still strong.

960
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,800
This is the spirit of Kun Ling.

961
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Miss Ji.

962
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Drink water.

963
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
No.

964
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
He is really great.

965
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Really?

966
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Is it our Tang Fei?

967
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
No.

968
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
I am talking about Jian Xi.

969
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
He is not very good at acting.

970
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
But when he is acting.

971
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
He is very good.

972
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,800
But.

973
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
I am jealous of him.

974
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
You said you are jealous of him.

975
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I think.

976
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,800
He is born with a sense of acting.

977
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Not everyone has this.

978
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
You are the most talented actress.

979
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,800
Don't you think it is strange?

980
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
No.

981
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
It is totally different.

982
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
Miss Ji.

983
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Ji Qing is here.

984
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
You.

985
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Why are you here?

986
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
We want to interview Miss Ji Qing.

987
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Brother Fei is here.

988
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Let's do it together.

989
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
We don't accept any interview.

990
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Please, Brother Fei.

991
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Just say a few words to the netizens.

992
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Tang Fei.

993
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Let's accept the interview together.

994
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Thank you.

995
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Ok.

996
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Ask.

997
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
This is the first movie that Miss Ji Qing played after recovery.

998
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
She is with Mr. Tang Fei.

999
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
How do you feel?

1000
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I think.

1001
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
The script of The King of Liyuan is very good.

1002
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Tang Fei is a very good actor.

1003
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
So we are very happy to work together.

1004
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
You are a couple.

1005
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
This is a strong union.

1006
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
You are a little sensitive about this topic.

1007
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
This question is not good enough.

1008
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Don't be so petty.

1009
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Then I will change the question.

1010
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,800
What kind of woman does Brother Fei like?

1011
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,800
I remember you said that you like a gentle, generous and noble lady.

1012
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Isn't Miss Ji Qing such a woman?

1013
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Right?

1014
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Miss Ji Qing.

1015
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
What kind of man do you like?

1016
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
A man like Tang Fei.

1017
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
What kind of person is he?

1018
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
He is gentle and gentleman.

1019
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
He is a gentleman.

1020
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Sometimes he is stubborn.

1021
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
You mean he is a man of the opposite sex.

1022
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
What should I do?

1023
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Even if he is a man of the opposite sex, I like him.

1024
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Right.

1025
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Tang Fei is so handsome.

1026
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
If I were a woman, I would also be attracted to a man like Brother Fei.

1027
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Ok.

1028
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Let's not talk about these sensitive topics.

1029
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
I wish you two a good marriage.

1030
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Yes.

1031
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Thank you.

1032
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1033
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1034
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1035
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1036
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1037
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1038
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1039
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1040
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1041
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1042
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1043
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1044
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1045
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1046
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1047
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1048
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1049
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1050
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1051
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1052
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1053
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1054
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1055
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
I will go to the bathroom.

1056
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Find it her.

1057
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Or will it be someone else?

1058
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
Tell me.

1059
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
If you find it,

1060
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
you may be quite thebilder.

1061
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Right.

1062
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
It will be someone else then.

1063
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
I don't want to.

1064
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
I don't want to.

1065
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
I don't want to.

1066
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I want to think,

1067
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,800
I will stop wondering.

1068
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
I want to think,

1069
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
oller daily projects like this,

1070
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Around the world,

1071
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
I am looking forward

1072
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
to go back to China,

1073
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
Right.

1074
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,800
I haven't looked back

1075
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
For 15 years.

1076
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,340
Jared Shit?

1077
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,800
Good.

1078
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm a man.

1079
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,800
It's the first time I've seen you so gentle.

1080
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,800
I've always been gentle.

1081
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,800
But you can't see it.

1082
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,600
I think we're not suitable.

1083
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Let's stop here.

1084
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,800
Yes.

1085
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,400
Why?

1086
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,200
Ji Qin has always liked you.

1087
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,200
He's so good. You should cherish him.

1088
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,600
But I don't like him.

1089
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,000
But he's hurt for you.

1090
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,400
You should be responsible.

1091
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,800
Emotion is emotion.

1092
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,600
Responsibility is responsibility.

1093
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,400
I've never loved him.

1094
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,600
If it's because he's hurt this time,

1095
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
I'm with him.

1096
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,200
That's the real responsibility.

1097
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,800
Tell me, have you ever loved me?

1098
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,600
Even if just a little bit.

1099
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,400
What do you mean by looking at me like that?

1100
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,600
Say something. Are you dumb?

1101
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,600
This is for you.

1102
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,600
And...

1103
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,400
Thank you.

1104
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,800
I cry because I have too many fantasies.

1105
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,200
The rain falls on the flowers.

1106
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,400
The moonlight shines on me.

1107
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm lonely.

1108
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,800
I sing with my heart.

1109
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,000
I watch the flowers bloom.

1110
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,200
I watch loneliness disappear.

1111
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,400
I watch the tide rise and fall.

1112
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,800
The warmth of the people and the coldness of the sky.

1113
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,200
I have too many expectations.

1114
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,200
I become desperate in the end.

1115
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,200
I watch you come and go.

1116
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,800
I hold on to all the good things.

1117
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,200
Everything is in vain.

1118
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,200
I'm still stubborn.

1119
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,800
I'm young and crazy.

1120
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,800
There's a light that never forgets the past.

1121
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,800
Looking back, all our grudges will be remembered.

1122
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,800
You and I, we're getting lost on the road.

1123
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,400
The typhoon doesn't think about anything.

1124
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,400
Where will the new typhoon hit?

1125
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Just wait for a person to arrive at dawn.

1126
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,200
Just wait for a person to arrive at dawn.

1127
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,400
Just wait for a person to arrive at dawn.

1128
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,200
The new typhoon.
