Wei Qing!

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,080
What are you doing?

22
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,160
What am I doing?

23
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,230
I should be asking you!

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,040
A grown man like you

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,400
shouldn't be so weak-willed.

26
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,270
How could you choose to die

27
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,950
instead of facing the problem head-on?

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
You thought I was going to...

29
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,190
What else could it be?

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,950
Did you come out here
to marvel at the moon?

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,310
Please, this is only the second floor.

32
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,400
Even if I wanted to jump,
it wouldn't be from here.

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,830
I just came out to get some fresh air

34
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,080
because I couldn't sleep.

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,190
You're right.

36
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,720
This is the second floor.

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,240
Still, something is wrong.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,630
Why do you need fresh air
in the middle of the night?

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
You don't know

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,800
how loud your snoring is.

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,600
I really couldn't fall asleep.

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,080
That's because I was exhausted.

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,750
You've had enough fresh air, right?

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,270
Go back inside and sleep then.

45
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,550
Go on.

46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,030
What are you doing?

47
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,600
Are you going

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,550
to stare at me like this all night?

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,320
Where are you going?

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,240
I'm thirsty. I'm going to get water.

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,320
I'll go drink water too.

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Are you

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,880
worried about me?

54
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,320
Don't worry. I'm not that weak-willed.

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,160
I won't do anything stupid.

56
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,550
Besides, if I died,

57
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,110
what would happen if you were bullied?

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,190
What if you needed comforting
when you're sad?

59
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,080
Aside from you, no one dares bully me.

60
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,630
More reason for me not to die.

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,830
If I died,

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,630
no one would be able to bully you.

63
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,190
Is that really what you think?

64
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,800
Don't worry.

65
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,750
I will grow old together with you.

66
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll show you

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,240
what an energetic old man is.

68
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,110
I think you just want to woo old ladies.

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,390
No, no.

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,110
You are the only old lady I need.

71
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,190
Smooth-talker.

72
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,830
Go and drink water. I'm going to sleep.

73
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,070
That's too much.

74
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Don't you worry.

75
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,920
Xue Ning will be responsible
for his own actions.

76
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,760
Xue... Xue what?

77
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,760
Don't touch me.

78
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,040
What's the matter?

79
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,760
Nothing.

80
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,350
- I'll do it.
- It's fine.

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,440
I'll clean up.

82
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,390
You go and order breakfast. Go on.

83
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,350
Hurry up.

84
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,320
Did I have too much to drink last night?

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,270
I thought he had regained his memory.

86
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,600
Ning Fei without his old memory
is still Ning Fei.

87
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,830
Even if we did something,

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,950
it should be fine, right?

89
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,760
What the heck is all this?

90
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,480
You've been smiling for an hour.

91
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,550
Isn't your mouth tired?

92
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,550
No.

93
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,510
I'm enjoying it.

94
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,000
About what happened yesterday,

95
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,600
do you really not remember anything?

96
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,950
You remember?

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Tell me about it then.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm warning you.

99
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,270
You must not tell anyone about it.

100
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,480
Don't worry, I won't.

101
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,350
Also,

102
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,000
stop smiling.

103
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,600
I'll stop smiling.

104
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,270
I'll get it. You sit.

105
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,600
He doesn't remember?

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,000
Did I imagine it?

107
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,670
What are you doing here?

108
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,200
You're not welcomed here.

109
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,440
I'm here to see Feifei.

110
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,480
Why is he here?

111
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,830
Scram.

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,110
She doesn't want to see you.

113
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,200
What right do you have to stop me?

114
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,600
Step aside.

115
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,670
With my right as the man of the house.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,270
The fact that I'm her boyfriend.

117
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,270
Xue Ning.

118
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,880
Stop it.

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
Mr. Xue, what can I do for you?

120
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,600
Let's talk outside.

121
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,950
Go away.

122
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,640
How are you? Is the filming going well?

123
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,640
Mr. Xue.

124
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,350
You can be direct with me.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,790
I really don't like

126
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,270
the way we are now.

127
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,320
Must you be so cold to me

128
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,320
just because I'm Xue Zi's brother?

129
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,510
It's not because of her.

130
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,760
Then why?

131
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,440
Don't tell me it's because of him.

132
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,160
Is he really your boyfriend?

133
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,670
Yes.

134
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,270
Did you hear that?

135
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,110
Feifei is my girlfriend.

136
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,350
So please stop pestering her.

137
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
Okay?

138
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,000
Wishing you two the best.

139
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,950
There goes my female lead.

140
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,440
I'll turn you into one.

141
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,920
Go away.

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,230
You're having too much fun
being the domineering boyfriend.

143
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,270
You already admitted

144
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,480
that I'm your boyfriend.
There's no going back now.

145
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,720
I did so to get rid of him.

146
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,110
I'm not listening.

147
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,390
The point is, I'm your boyfriend.

148
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,950
I'm your boyfriend.

149
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,720
How could you be so childish?

150
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,640
Hopefully, my choice is the right one.

151
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,880
Most of the shareholders
have signed their names.

152
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,920
Currently, there's one last
main shareholder

153
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,720
who is still considering.

154
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,350
He said he'd like
to talk to you face-to-face.

155
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,960
Okay. Set it up.

156
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,320
I'll talk to him personally.

157
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,200
Will do.

158
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,710
Does Xue Le know?

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,230
He hasn't been going
into Shangjue lately.

160
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,590
He goes to Yunma every day.

161
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,150
He certainly thinks of himself
as Yunma's chairman.

162
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,280
The other shareholders

163
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,200
are already unhappy with him.

164
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,470
After all, they wanted Wei An
to be the chairman.

165
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,670
They weren't expecting

166
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,710
a regent like Xue Le.

167
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,350
Let them be discontent for a while more.

168
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,230
It's not yet time to counterattack.

169
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,230
Rest up for the time being.

170
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,670
You'll have a lot to do in a few days.

171
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,440
Alright.

172
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,320
Mr. Wei.

173
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,960
Why didn't you tell me
you'd pull the rug from under them

174
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,910
right from the beginning?

175
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,960
Tell you?

176
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,790
Who knows 

177
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
if a wife-worshiper like you

178
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,590
would accidentally spill the beans?

179
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,400
I had to observe and test you
for some time first.

180
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,440
So you're worried

181
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,280
that Qiujing
would tell Shishi if she knew?

182
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,550
Are you going
to continue keeping it from her?

183
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,470
She's happily doing her job at Snow.

184
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,710
That's a good thing.

185
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,470
Not knowing anything

186
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,230
means Xue Zi won't be able to use her.

187
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,320
We all know

188
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
how much Shishi worries about you.

189
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,840
Before this,

190
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,520
she actually thought
you'd do something stupid.

191
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,440
So I think it's better for you

192
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,520
to explain this to her personally.

193
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,200
There's no rush.

194
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,840
I'll talk to her

195
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,470
once the matter is settled.

196
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,440
Alright.

197
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,790
We're done with official business.
Now, time for personal matters.

198
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,230
The soup recipe you taught me before?

199
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,150
Zhou Shi really liked it.

200
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,880
What are you going
to teach me this time?

201
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,880
Let's start with the basics.

202
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,280
Stir-fried tomatoes and eggs.

203
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,790
Stir-fried tomatoes and eggs?

204
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,960
Okay. Let's do it.

205
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,350
Hello, everyone.

206
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,200
Welcome to my food live stream.

207
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Today, I will be making

208
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,880
stir-fried tomatoes and eggs.

209
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,910
First, we have

210
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,710
tomatoes that have been chopped.

211
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,710
Next, we need our eggs.

212
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,470
I've beaten them.

213
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,000
But I'm going to add one more.

214
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,470
Yes, one more egg.

215
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,150
Then,

216
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,880
mix it thoroughly.

217
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,000
Then...

218
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,710
Pour the oil.

219
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,840
Then pour the eggs in.

220
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,910
What are you trying to dodge?

221
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,590
You didn't turn the stove on.

222
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,550
You didn't turn it on for me?

223
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,640
Mr. Wei, why don't we

224
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,350
turn off the live stream first?

225
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,760
No, don't turn it off.

226
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,550
Continue.

227
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,110
Turn on the heat.

228
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,230
It's not voice-controlled.

229
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,550
I know it's not.

230
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,960
I'm telling you.

231
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,640
Turn on the fire.

232
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,590
First, we need to cook the eggs.

233
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,670
What is it, Feifei?

234
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,790
(You need to check it out.)

235
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,760
(Your Wei Qing is about
to burn down the kitchen.)

236
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,640
What?

237
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,080
(Check out the live stream I sent you.)

238
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,000
(You'll see.)

239
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,280
(Stir it. It's getting burnt.)

240
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,350
(I'm stirring, aren't I?)

241
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,350
(Be careful. That's not how you do it.)

242
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,670
What are they doing?

243
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,670
- (How do I toss it? I don't know how!)
- (Try and figure it out.)

244
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,400
(Not like that.)

245
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,790
(With more strength. Use your arm.)

246
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,440
(The oil is splattering!)

247
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
(Turn off the heat!)

248
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
(Be careful!)

249
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
- That idiot.
- (What should I do?)

250
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,590
I'm home.

251
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,760
You're back.

252
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,280
Just in time. Wash up and eat.

253
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,110
These dishes...

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,880
Did you make them all?

255
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,230
Of course...

256
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,880
Of course, I made one of them.

257
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,710
Guess which?

258
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,910
How did you know?

259
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,080
Show me your hands.

260
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,960
Quickly.

261
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,760
Quick.

262
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,670
It's not painful. I'm fine.

263
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,080
You deserved to be burned.

264
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,470
Stretch it out.

265
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,280
Hurry up.

266
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,840
Why...

267
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,400
How did you...

268
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,790
You shouldn't have streamed it
if you didn't want me to know.

269
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,840
Now what?

270
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,590
Everyone knows.

271
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,200
The great chairman of Yunma

272
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,320
is terrible at cooking.

273
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,880
Don't you feel embarrassed at all?

274
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,030
As long as you're not.

275
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,910
It doesn't matter
what others think of me.

276
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,030
I don't care.

277
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,960
But I care. I don't like it at all!

278
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,150
Did I hurt you?

279
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,320
Let me see.

280
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,030
This... It really hurts.

281
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,320
You deserve it.

282
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,640
Alright. Hurry up and eat.

283
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,400
I want to talk to you after we eat.

284
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm going to wash my hands.

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,520
I didn't think Xue Le would do that.

286
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,710
Looks like

287
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,640
he's short-selling Yunma.

288
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,320
He made Yunma invest
the up-front capital.

289
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,590
Then the profit

290
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,790
to directed to Shangjue

291
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,110
using a third party.

292
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,910
What a greedy guy.

293
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,200
What do you plan to do?

294
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,640
Are you still going to do nothing?

295
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,760
Don't worry.

296
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,590
He can't see the forest for the trees.

297
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,440
However much he takes today,

298
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll make him pay double next time.

299
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,590
Are you ready for it?

300
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,760
You should be asking,

301
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,760
is Xue Le ready?

302
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,790
(Stir it. It's getting burnt.)

303
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,840
(I'm stirring, aren't I?)

304
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,710
(Be careful. That's not how you do it.)

305
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,960
Is Wei Qing trying to be a food vlogger?

306
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,760
He even set up an account

307
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,880
(Wei Qing)
and announced his next live stream.

308
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,440
Seems like he's set on becoming
an Internet celebrity.

309
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,000
So much for worrying

310
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,400
about his secret plan.

311
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,710
I guess

312
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,470
I was thinking too much.

313
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,080
Wei Qing is loaded.

314
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,080
If I were him, I'd retire too.

315
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,640
What are you doing here?

316
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,590
To celebrate my sister's birthday.

317
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,350
How thoughtful.

318
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,520
Are you alone?

319
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,470
It's awfully quiet.

320
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,440
I thought you'd organize

321
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,710
a birthday party at home.

322
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,790
I've never liked crowds.

323
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,000
You should know.

324
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,080
I doubt you came

325
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,150
just to celebrate my birthday.

326
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,350
Yes, there is another reason.

327
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,830
Another reason to celebrate.

328
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,040
What is it?

329
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,950
You should be aware. After all,

330
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,470
you're one of Yunma's shareholders.

331
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,760
Are you talking 

332
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,000
about your transferring
of Yunma's assets?

333
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,040
That's right.

334
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,520
Why did you do it?

335
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,640
You're not after money.

336
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,230
Because I'm able to.

337
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,310
And you can't.

338
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,830
Right now, aside from the fact
that I'm not Yunma's chairman,

339
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,000
everything else

340
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,830
is under my control.

341
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,950
What exactly do you have on Wei An

342
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,920
to make him obey you?

343
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,950
That's none of your concern.

344
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,190
I just came to tell you.

345
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,920
The competition with Wei Qing?

346
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,520
I've won.

347
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,710
And you've lost.

348
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,760
I guess you're better than me.

349
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,230
So I suppose I should let you
manage Snow too.

350
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,400
Is that for me?

351
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,710
Do you mind if I open it now?

352
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,110
Well?

353
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,520
Do you like it?

354
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,590
Let me get this call.

355
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,350
Okay.

356
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,070
Got it.

357
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,710
I like it very much.

358
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,560
Thank you.

359
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,280
Glad you like it.

360
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
I'll be going then.

361
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,350
Why don't you stay for dinner?

362
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,280
I'm good.

363
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,560
I have other matters to attend to.

364
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,400
Happy birthday.

365
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,070
A dove occupying a magpie's nest.

366
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,640
Clearly, the magpie
failed to guard its nest.

367
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,560
Why blame the dove?

368
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:36,975
(Legal representative: Wei Qing)

369
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,920
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

370
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,160
Here's to a good partnership.

371
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,590
That's the last one.

372
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,040
It's ready. Make the call.

373
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,680
Time to proceed to the next step.

374
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,520
Okay.

375
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,590
Are you sure

376
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,400
he had his memory back then?

377
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,920
But you said you drank a lot.

378
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,190
Could it be you imagined it
because you were drunk?

379
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,640
I suspected as much.

380
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,230
But everything that happened

381
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,760
couldn't be more real.

382
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What happened?

383
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,920
Nothing.

384
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,040
But I'm willing to bet

385
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,350
that he's regained his memory.

386
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,310
Because he seemed to remember

387
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,400
what happened to you two that day.

388
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,760
But the next day,

389
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,230
it was as if it had never happened.

390
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,070
That's odd.

391
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,350
Anyway,

392
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,710
has Xue Ning ever been drunk with you?

393
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,800
Never. That guy can handle his liquor.

394
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,230
I've never seen him drunk.

395
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,230
Why?

396
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,040
I've never seen him drunk too.

397
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,350
Maybe he remembers the past

398
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,950
when he drinks too much.

399
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,760
Why don't I call Dr. Chen

400
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,880
and ask him?

401
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,280
Let's try it first.

402
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,710
What's the rush?

403
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,880
To buy alcohol.

404
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,830
You're back.

405
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,710
What is it?

406
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,710
Have you been waiting for me?

407
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,110
Of course. Come and drink with me.

408
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,350
You're in a good mood.

409
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,400
How will we drink all this?

410
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,920
You came home late today. So...

411
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,040
This glass is yours.

412
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,430
As expected, men always talk big.

413
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,430
I'll drink it myself.

414
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,560

00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,950
(Feifei.)

510
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
How is it?

511
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,760
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

512
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,920
When he wakes up,

513
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,310
just apologize to him properly.

514
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,110
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

515
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,310
I really went overboard this time.

516
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,350
He's not going to forgive me.

517
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
- Mr. Wei.
- Feifei.

518
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,520
Are you all right, Feifei?

519
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,160
What happened to Xue Ning?

520
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,000
How did he end up in the hospital?

521
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,710
The doctor said
he had alcohol poisoning.

522
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,400
How much did you make him drink?

523
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,830
One crate plus.

524
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,470
Why did he drink so much?

525
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,710
Why didn't you stop him?

526
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,760
I coerced him to drink.

527
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,110
Feifei told me

528
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,520
that Fei had appeared.

529
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,880
So I gave her the silly idea.

530
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,190
I thought if Xue Ning got drunk,

531
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,160
he'd be able to remember the past.

532
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,070
(How could you suggest
something like that?)

533
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,590
(He's starting to remember)

534
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,110
(because he stopped taking medication.)

535
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,430
(Regaining one's memory by drinking)

536
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,000
(has no scientific evidence.)

537
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,350
(It just happened by chance.)

538
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,590
(I made a stupid mistake then.)

539
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,040
He's probably been slowly

540
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,830
recovering his memory this whole time.

541
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,590
So how is he now?

542
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,880
Is he out of danger?

543
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,230
The doctor said he was fine.

544
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,110
Thankfully, Feifei got him here in time.

545
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,280
I think it's better to take our time

546
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,110
in helping him regain his memory.

547
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
We should choose a safer,

548
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,800
more Conservative route to treat it.

549
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,950
If Fei regains his past memory,

550
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,640
will Xue Ning's current memory

551
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,000
remain?

552
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,920
If it disappears,

553
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,110
it somehow feels like
we killed the person.

554
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,230
Let's check on him first.

555
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,920
He should be awake by now.

556
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,350
Where is he?

557
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,280
He must have escaped.

558
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,830
Why did he run off?

559
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,760
He probably overheard our conversation.

560
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,190
Our conversation?

561
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,310
Do you mean regarding his lost memory?

562
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,710
He's actually very sensitive.

563
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,280
And he's prideful.

564
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,110
He's hospitalized for alcohol poisoning,

565
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,590
but the only thing we cared about

566
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,350
is whether he remembered his past.

567
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,160
He probably
doesn't want to see us again.

568
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,760
My bad. I shouldn't have said it.

569
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,040
Stop it. Now's not the time to feel bad.

570
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,070
We need to find him.

571
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Don't just stand there. Let's go.

572
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,640
Darling, let's go.

573
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,280
We should leave from the back door.

574
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,710
Try to think like Xue Ning

575
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,590
and figure out where he'd go.

576
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,160
That way, it is more efficient

577
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,920
and we'll be more likely to find him.

578
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,350
Slow down, Darling.

579
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,430
Darling!

580
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,230
Nurse!

581
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,760
Well? Did you find him?

582
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,040
No.

583
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,710
Do you think

584
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,430
he'll do something stupid?

585
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,470
He's not that weak.

586
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
He's not a kid.

587
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,950
No need to fret.

588
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,350
I'm not sad

589
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,350
simply because he left.

590
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,190
What is it then?

591
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,950
It's what Miss Brainiac said.

592
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,400
All of us,

593
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,710
particularly me,

594
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,070
are only concerned

595
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,280
about whether he regains his memory.

596
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,470
No one cared
about his present predicament.

597
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,190
What makes it worse

598
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,590
is that I used him.

599
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,800
There's no definite answer here.

600
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,430
The only thing we can do
is to go with the flow.

601
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,520
That's right. I think for today,

602
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
you should go back and rest.

603
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,310
Who knows he'll come back tomorrow
when he's clear-headed?

604
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,710
We'll take you home.

605
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,070
You might just see him

606
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,400
when you open the door.

607
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,310
You're right.
Maybe he's already gone home.

608
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,350
Let's hurry then.

609
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,000
Darling, how are you feeling?

610
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,040
Doctor,

611
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,590
we can have another baby
if this one's gone.

612
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,560
But first, you have to make sure
my wife is safe.

613
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,560
Baby?

614
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,920
She is not pregnant.

615
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,640
She just fainted
due to a low glucose level.

616
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,950
Putting it more simply,

617
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,830
she fainted
because she didn't eat anything today.

618
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,000
You can give her some chocolate.

619
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,950
She'll be fine afterward.

620
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,190
She's not pregnant?

621
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:28,200
(Ninghai Hospital Inspection Report)

622
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,590
But doctor,

623
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,190
she got two lines

624
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,520
on the pregnancy test kit.

625
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,070
Pregnancy test kits

626
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,160
aren't 100 percent accurate.

627
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,680
If you're still not convinced,

628
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,350
you can come back again tomorrow

629
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,430
to do a pregnancy test.

630
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,310
Rest for a while longer.

631
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,640
Then you may be discharged.

632
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,400
Thank you, Doctor.

633
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,470
Thank you, Doctor.

634
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,000
I didn't expect

635
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,880
it to be a blunder.

636
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,590
I told you.

637
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,230
You guys celebrated too soon.

638
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,830
Darling, it's fine.

639
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,430
This time may have been a blunder,

640
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,400
but if we make an effort,

641
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,040
we can turn it into reality.

642
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,470
Why don't we give it a try tonight?

643
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,710
We're at the hospital.

644
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,950
Let's talk at home.

645
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,680
Ning Fei!

646
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,350
Feifei.

647
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,830
Go sit down.

648
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,280
Feifei.

649
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,710
I'll stay with you tonight.

650
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,190
No need.

651
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,920
Then, you be good.

652
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,710
Call us if there's anything.

653
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,400
Don't worry. I'll be fine by myself.

654
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,350
It's fine.

That stupid brat.

680
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,320
Still behaving the same
even after losing his memory.

681
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,870
I'm sick of his disappearing acts.

682
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,870
When I find you,

683
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,800
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

Xue Ning?

689
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,080
Xue Ning.

690
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,760
What are you doing here?

691
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,710
I have nowhere else to go.

692
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,280
Come on. Let's go home.

693
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,280
Home?

694
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,280
Yes. Our home.

695
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,430
But I'm no longer the old me.

696
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,670
Right now,

697
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,520
I'm the Xue Ning
who doesn't remember anything.

698
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,320
I don't care if you remember or not.

699
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,080
You're still my beloved little brother.

700
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,800
And my only family.

701
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,120
But previously, I...

702
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,230
We're family.

703
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,870
It doesn't matter what happened.
We always need each other.

704
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,600
Let's go home.

705
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,910
Thank you for coming to find me.

706
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,430
For letting me know

707
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,760
that I'm not that terrible of a sister.

708
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,910
I'm sorry.

709
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,000
Sister.

710
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,190
Let's go.

711
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,670
Why aren't the funds in?

712
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,000
The transfer is delayed?

713
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,710
How many days has it been?

714
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,980
Hello?

715
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,120
Get over here.

716
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,630
Find out why the funds aren't in yet.

717
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,150
According to the plan,

718
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,040
we should be reaping
the rewards right now.

719
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,470
I've had someone check.

720
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,760
We discovered that Wei An

721
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,230
has been in close contact
with the company.

722
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
I suspect he's up to no good.

723
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,840
Wei An?

724
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,150
Mr. Xue, why did you want
to see me so urgently?

725
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,430
Is something wrong?

726
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,230
If you know it's urgent,

727
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,320
why did you make me wait so long?

728
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,600
My apologies.

729
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,800
There's a lot to do at the office.

730
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,910
I had to settle them first.

731
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,600
I know you're busy.

732
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,360
So I won't beat around the bush.

733
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,080
I have a question.

734
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,040
Why is the payment to Shangjue

735
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,360
still not in?

736
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,230
You trying to short-sell Yunma

737
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,230
is much too flagrant.

738
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,760
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

739
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,560
It's not up to you.

740
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,760
You simply don't have a choice.

741
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Mr. Xue.

742
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,190
You violated our initial agreement.

743
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,800
We had agreed

744
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,390
that I'd help you take down Snow

745
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,760
with Yunma's intervention.

746
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,910
But now,

747
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,710
you want to take Yunma for yourself too.

748
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,600
Just as the river looks for the sea,

749
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,630
humans seek to go higher.

750
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,840
My appetite has grown.

751
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,670
Snow

752
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,800
is no longer able to satiate me.

753
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,320
What if it's too much
for you to stomach?

754
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,760
Wei An, oh, Wei An.

755
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,950
After only being
the chairman for a while,

756
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,870
you seem to have forgotten your place.

757
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,000
Clean your own backside first
before you talk crap.

758
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,320
So, everything you did

759
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,120
was to seize Yunma,

760
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,470
to have power.

761
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,710
What did you think?

762
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,150
At first, I really thought

763
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,560
you were someone capable
with aspirations.

764
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,870
I didn't expect you to be so despicable.

765
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,840
No wonder the Xue family

766
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,630
gave the inheritance
to the adopted daughter

767
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,670
instead of you, the actual son.

768
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,710
Don't try and provoke me.

769
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,320
No one

770
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,840
is going to believe
a tainted person like you.

771
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,710
The moment I expose your dirty secrets,

772
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,280
I bet

773
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,430
none of the shareholders

774
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,870
will let you continue managing Yunma.

775
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,190
So,

776
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,670
best for you to do as I say.

777
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,120
You'll be spared some grub at least.

778
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,320
(There's no need
for everyone to believe him.)

779
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,760
(So long as I do.)
