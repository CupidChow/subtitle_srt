18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Li Mingcheng.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,240
You both know him.

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,600
These photos you see

21
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,190
are from a personal photo album

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,680
that I found by chance.

23
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,960
Technical-wise,

24
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,110
none of these are frontal shots.

25
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,070
You can say this person is highly skilled.

26
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,040
Art-wise,

27
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,640
these are rare high-definition raw photos.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,710
Wait a second.

29
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,390
Aren't these

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,350
taken without permission?

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,430
Exactly.

32
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,550
I'm getting chills.

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,240
Aren't you reporting this to the police?

34
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,350
There's no need to.

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,070
I know that person's nature.

36
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,430
I just don't know who it is.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,960
One thing I am sure of

38
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,960
is that this person

39
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,430
is very close to Li Mingcheng,

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,240
and harbors extremely unusual feelings

41
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,990
for him.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,430
Well, Miss Brainiac.

43
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,430
I have to remind you.

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,790
The person that's caught on camera
is your husband.

45
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,070
Yes. She's also a stalker.

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
She might even have
some crazy possessive behavior.

47
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,790
Aren't you worried?

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,910
I'd like to hear her thoughts.

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,550
Is my husband that charming?

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,990
What made her fall for him?

51
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,710
I'm dying of curiosity.

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,480
How can you even be curious
at this point?

53
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,400
Forget it.

54
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,880
We can't judge her based on the minds

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,990
of normal people.

56
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,510
Where are you going?

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
I lost the bet. So I'm washing the dishes.

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,960
Miss Brainiac.

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,070
What do you plan to do next?

60
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,600
You can't be letting this continue, right?

61
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,910
You want to know?

62
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,960
I can trade it for your secret with Xue Zi.

63
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,040
What secret do I have?

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,400
I've told you all about it.

65
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,430
Oh, please.

66
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,880
These lies are only good enough for Lin Feifei.

67
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,430
Knowing how much you love Wei Qing,

68
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,960
there is no way
you would go missing for two years.

69
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,710
Something else must have happened.

70
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,270
Is Xue Zi

71
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,710
threatening you with something?

72
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,040
I'll get the door.

73
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,840
Who's here?

74
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,880
Such terrible timing.

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Shishi.

76
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,600
Mingcheng.

77
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,760
Don't you have to go to work this morning?

78
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,910
I come to make sure she's eating breakfast.

79
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,480
Zhou Shi is here. There's no way I'd be starving.

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,950
By the way, Zhou Shi.

81
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,390
Why don't you move in with us?

82
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,480
The spare room is always vacant anyway.

83
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
I don't think it's a good idea.

84
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,230
Won't I be intruding into your private lives?

85
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,150
We already have a third wheel,
which is Lin Feifei.

86
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,430
We don't mind having one more.

87
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,390
I can hear you.

88
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,430
I will get even with you
after catching up on sleep.

89
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,150
Consider my offer.

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,430
I need to be somewhere else.

91
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,670
I'll talk to you next time.

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
One more thing.

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,230
Watch out.

94
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Watch out?

95
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,080
Watch out for what?

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,480
It's better if you don't know.

97
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,360
Soup dumplings again?

98
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,520
It's a new flavor with cuttlefish fillings.

99
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,600
Do you want it?

100
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
Sure.

101
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,390
Get in.

102
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,080
Boss.

103
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,880
I have something to report.

104
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,550
You met Wei Qing?

105
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,760
Were your feelings reignited?

106
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,990
Not at all.

107
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,430
I remember what I promised you.

108
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,550
That's no longer needed.

109
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,880
From here on,

110
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,670
our agreement is canceled.

111
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,990
What do you mean?

112
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,880
You no longer have to waste time on Xue Ning.

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
You can go back to Wei Qing now.

114
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,990
Why?

115
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,040
Are you too overwhelmed to speak?

116
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,920
Boss.

117
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,950
You told me this a long time ago.

118
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
If I don't want Wei Qing to lose everything,

119
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,270
I should stay away from him.

120
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,710
What exactly did you mean?

121
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,600
How you want to interpret it is up to you.

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,230
Darling, eat more.

123
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,710
Were you working
through the night again yesterday?

124
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,270
There have been major changes
in the futures market lately.

125
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,670
Things are tougher than before.

126
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,920
If that's the case,

127
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,670
why did you come here
early in the morning?

128
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
It's a ritual.

129
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,800
If I don't see you in the morning,

130
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,920
it feels like the day hasn't started.

131
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,670
Do you want to have lunch together?

132
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,760
Lunch?

133
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,920
My office is a whole city away from your school.

134
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,110
By the time you get there,

135
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,390
it's probably nighttime.

136
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,600
Let me check my message, Darling.

137
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,920
My secretary is rushing me
for the morning meeting.

138
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,040
I have to go.

139
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,480
Stay here and be good.
Stop eating takeouts.

140
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,640
See you tonight.

141
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,760
See you later.

142
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,390
Zhou Shi never told me

143
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,880
that you two had such a relationship.

144
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,360
If I had known about this,

145
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,390
we could have avoided all these troubles.

146
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,640
Zhou Shi.

147
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,270
Since you're here,

148
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,990
why don't you sit down and have a chat?

149
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,430
Your boyfriend is here too.

150
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,230
Boyfriend?

151
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,550
Zhou Shi, why didn't you tell me

152
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,950
about your relationship?

153
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,950
If I knew

154
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,550
that Shangjue and Yunma
are in a partnership,

155
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,270
I wouldn't have suspected

156
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,430
the quality issue with Shangjue Jewelry.

157
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,950
After all, Yunma is a regular
client of our exhibit.

158
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,670
I feel more at ease
with him vouching for it.

159
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,360
Are you kidding me? We are...

160
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,670
I only got to work with you

161
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,800
thanks to my girlfriend.

162
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,360
How about we take a look
at the exhibits first,

163
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
then continue our discussion after?

164
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
It's downstairs.

165
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,990
-Let go of me.
-No.

166
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,990
If you don't, I'll beat you up.

167
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,720
-Hit me then.
-I...

168
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,350
Come on. Hit me.

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,990
Mr. Wei.

170
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,280
I don't think it's nice to lie
about being someone's boyfriend.

171
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,110
Is that so?

172
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,430
What about being locked in the washroom

173
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,350
and getting ditched
while chatting someone up?

174
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,720
You're still holding a grudge.

175
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,200
Can't you think of it

176
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,550
as me losing my mind yesterday

177
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,550
and letting it go?

178
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,160
I got taken advantage of by my ex
for no reason.

179
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,790
Do you think I would take it lying down?

180
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,670
It was inappropriate of me. I apologize.

181
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,640
If you're still mad,
then sue me for sexual harassment.

182
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,030
I don't have the time for that.

183
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,110
All I ever wanted

184
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,400
was just an explanation.

185
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,590
Let me ask you.

186
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,590
How do you really feel?

187
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,160
If you don't tell me,

188
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,910
I'll interpret it my own way.

189
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,430
Zhou Shi.

190
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,200
Are you trying to get back together with me?

191
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,670
We could.

192
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,880
As long as you say it first,

193
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,030
I can forget about everything in the past.

194
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,110
What do you say?

195
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,760
Think about it.

196
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,470
I...

197
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,200
Your collar is unbuckled.

198
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,960
It's up to you to escape.

199
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,990
As long as you can bear
the consequences.

200
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,110
Don't be silly.

201
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,430
Have you been single for so long

202
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,430
that you can't even tell
if someone is just flirting?

203
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,880
There are two ways

204
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,030
for a woman to dump a man.

205
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,080
As for the first method,

206
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,990
I've used that two years ago.

207
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,720
As for the second,

208
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,760
it's what I did to you yesterday.

209
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,470
If you seriously feel wronged,

210
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,720
let's set a date.

211
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
I'll pay whatever I owe you.

212
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,520
Sure. When?

213
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,030
Since that's how you think of me,

214
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,720
whether it's a one-shot deal

215
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,350
or position trading,

216
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,840
I have no reason to turn it down. Am I right?

217
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,030
However,

218
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,320
don't you give up halfway this time.

219
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,990
Same time tomorrow.

220
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,590
The same hotel as last time.

221
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,400
If you don't come to me,

222
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,520
I'll come to you.

223
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,350
Look how I jinxed it!

224
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,600
(Wei Heng, Yunma Group Chairperson)

225
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,400
(Wei Heng's wife and son. Wei Heng and Wei An)

226
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,763
(Detestable But Good-looking)

227
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,350
(The first day of running
away from home. I'm so bored.)

228
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,230
Give it to me.

229
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,400
I happened to be free today.
Want to meet?

230
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,880
Do you want to meet?

231
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,760
Let's meet up.

232
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,840
Let's meet up tonight.

233
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,790
I'm free tonight.

234
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,790
I'm not.

235
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,160
I need to stay back for work.

236
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,350
I'm rushing for a paper
that is due tomorrow.

237
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,200
What kind of friends do I have?

238
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,880
Whose house are you going to?

239
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,790
You again.

240
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,760
Are you a tail on my back?

241
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,230
You're always tailing me.

242
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,760
Watch your tongue.

243
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,520
You're the one who grabbed my kid's lollipop.

244
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,400
No.

245
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,430
Sorry about that.
Please forgive his childish behavior.

246
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,400
We only traded lollipops.

247
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,590
I traded the biggest one in the shop

248
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,520
for his small lollipop.

249
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,640
Kiddo, this small one is mine.

250
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,160
The big one is yours.

251
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,350
Just say yes

252
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,350
and I'll buy you the biggest one.

253
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,670
Don't listen to his nonsense.
He's the one who grabbed it.

254
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,030
I'll compensate you.

255
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,640
Here you go.

256
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,350
How could you encourage

257
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,670
such a small kid to lie?

258
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,910
Do you have any conscience?

259
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,230
What's wrong? There was mutual consent.

260
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,720
"What's wrong"?

261
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,400
With your wrong core values,

262
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,160
you're even trying
to be a bad influence on the kid?

263
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,960
Listen. The world

264
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,400
will eventually teach him how to be bad

265
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,720
without my help.

266
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,590
Those core values you care so much about

267
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,550
may very well be a layer of skin shed by them

268
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,520
as they grow up.

269
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,320
Is having a conscience really important?

270
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,590
You're twisting facts.

271
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,990
I just don't get it.

272
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,110
How did you end up being this little demon?

273
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,160
Sorry.

274
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,790
I'm not that little angel in your heart.

275
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,840
I don't wish to become him either.

276
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,520
So?

277
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,550
Do you still want to school me?

278
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,990
Of course.

279
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,880
So what if you cleared the memory?

280
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
So what if you changed
the name and look?

281
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,080
The person is still the same.

282
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,080
I won't let you give up on yourself like this.

283
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,110
Hey.

284
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,550
You're not shamelessly clinging to me

285
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,400
because you've got no suitors, are you?

286
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,200
Excuse me? I've got no suitors?

287
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,790
With just the snap of my fingers,

288
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,520
I can have tons of people show up.

289
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,350
Miss Lin.

290
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,230
Mr. Xue. What brings you here?

291
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,030
You make it sound like
I don't visit shopping centers.

292
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,990
What about you?
This is the children's zone.

293
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,430
What's an adult like you doing here?

294
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm here with a relative's kid.

295
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,110
Look. They're having fun over there.

296
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,180
I'm relieved to see you like this.

297
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,180
I was worried

298
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,840
that you would keep a distance from me

299
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,520
after knowing my identity.

300
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,400
I guess

301
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,590
you're not as petty as I thought.

302
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,280
Having etiquette is still a must though.

303
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,430
An apology gift.

304
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,470
That's not necessary.

305
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,640
It was my fault last time
for being greedy for food.

306
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,520
Besides, this looks expensive. So no, thanks.

307
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,910
Take this then. It isn't expensive.

308
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,590
Bye.

309
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,880
What is it? Why is it warm?

310
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,880
Mr. Xue. You left this.

311
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,790
It suits you.

312
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,110
Wear it and show me next time.

313
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,230
Bye.

314
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,160
The sight of it is delightful.

315
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,590
Just like him.

316
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,670
Unlike that brat.

317
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,520
Where did he go?

318
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Where is he?

319
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,880
Does it really suit me?

320
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
Rich people are tacky.

321
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,880
They always give people things like jewelry.

322
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,640
It suits me? Never!

323
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,160
What is this?

324
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
A ring?

325
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,830
A pendant?

326
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,760
This young heir of the Xue family

327
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,350
is quite good at picking up women.

328
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,721
(From Girlfriend: Take your pills on time
no matter where you are.)

329
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,160
Now you miss me.

330
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,990
I'm not listening to you.

331
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,880
Obedient Pill?

332
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,920
Let's see how obedient you are.

333
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,680
Come in.

334
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,280
Mr. Li.

335
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,990
We have a few new interns joining us.

336
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,110
HR told me to bring them to you.

337
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,350
The data analysis team is shorthanded.

338
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,680
You can take them to Ada.

339
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:28,990
Okay.

340
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,160
Is there anything else

341
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,440
you would like to tell them?

342
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,590
Learning the ropes in investment
takes a long time,

343
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
but not everyone has the patience

344
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,680
to wait till you do.

345
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,710
If you want to stay,

346
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,350
then show me what you've got.

347
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,160
We only need smart ones here.

348
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,110
Noted.

349
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,110
You may leave.

350
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,230
Follow me.

351
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,710
Thank you.

352
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,880
You're welcome.

353
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Darling.

354
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,070
What are you doing here?

355
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,160
Good afternoon, Mr. Li.

356
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,830
Would you like to have lunch together?

357
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,920
I guess not. If you'll excuse me.

358
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,950
Wait.

359
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,470
What's going on?

360
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,350
Mr. Li, we have a team building
for the newcomers tonight.

361
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,520
Would you like to...

362
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,160
You're already welcoming her.

363
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,470
Thank you for the bandage, Mr. Li.

364
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,710
I shall excuse myself.

365
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,350
I see. It was a bandage. I thought...

366
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,230
(This is it.)

367
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,760
(The pantry specially for managers
and those ranked above.)

368
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,990
(Those who can come here often
without raising suspicion)

369
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,990
(are only the heads of the departments.)

370
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,800
(As for the biggest suspect among them...)

371
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
What should we eat tonight?

372
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,070
Let's have barbecue.

373
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,590
Okay. Let's have that arranged.

374
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,640
The director, Mr. Li, is so harsh.

375
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,160
What a waste for his good look.

376
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,280
This is the Investment Department,

377
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,800
which is the most profitable
in Yunma Group.

378
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,880
Those who get recruited
are elites from top universities.

379
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,310
It's normal for them to judge employees
based on intelligence.

380
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,680
But that one over there

381
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,680
doesn't look very smart.

382
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,440
That is Mr. Li's secretary, right?

383
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,800
If such a dummy can stay,

384
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,400
then we can too.

385
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,760
(I didn't expect you
to have this type of secretary.)

386
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,040
(She's pretty adorable.)

387
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,830
(Let me explain.)

388
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,160
(No, I can't say that.)

389
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,680
(You must have gotten the wrong idea.)

390
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,070
(I shouldn't say that either.)

391
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,230
This won't do.

392
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,880
It's too halfhearted.

393
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,830
It will make her think
that I'm really hiding something.

394
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,350
I must reply to this seriously.

395
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,350
I can't believe

396
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,710
she will be jealous.

397
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,280
Rachel.

398
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,070
You're picking this song again.

399
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,920
Since Mr. Li and the rest aren't here yet,

400
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,640
go and get some snacks at the snack bar.

401
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,160
Sunny, what would you like me to get?

402
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,230
I'll write it down.

403
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,990
Okay then.

404
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,230
Take note of what I'm about to say.

405
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,470
Including the room next door,

406
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,230
there will be 51 of us.

407
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,590
Among these 51 people,

408
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,400
we need three types of snacks.

409
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Popcorn, potato chips and fried chicken.

410
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,990
Among these 51 people,

411
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,310
those who want popcorn and chips

412
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,760
are twice the amount of those
who only want chips.

413
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,470
Those who only want chips

414
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,990
are twice the amount of those
who only want fried chicken.

415
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,830
On top of that,

416
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,040
25 people don't want fried chicken,

417
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,190
18 people don't want popcorn,

418
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,760
and 13 people don't want chips.

419
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,230
There are six people who want everything,

420
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,400
except for popcorn.

421
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,880
Did you get that?

422
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,110
Okay. You have half an hour.

423
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,400
Get them at the snack bar.

424
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,710
Make sure you get the exact amount.

425
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,310
Bring it to us once you've sorted them.

426
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,950
What's wrong?

427
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,400
Is the task too difficult for you?

428
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,470
You've got to be kidding me.

429
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,070
You can't even do such a simple task?

430
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Or are you

431
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,110
an idiot without Mr. Li?

432
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,950
Just get to it.

433
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,950
Everyone, cheers.

434
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,990
Some people want all three.

435
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,830
Some only want two.

436
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,800
The rest only want one.

437
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,160
These are six who want potato chips
and fried chicken.

438
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,710
What exactly do they want?

439
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,040
Miss.

440
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,470
Miss.

441
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,110
What exactly do you want to order?

442
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,710
I want...

443
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,800
I'll have 33 tubs of popcorn,

444
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,400
26 boxes of fried chicken,
and 38 bags of potato chips.

445
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,110
Sort them according to the list
and delivery them to Room 888.

446
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,990
Hello. There are 14 people

447
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,800
who want all three snacks.

448
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,110
Eighteen people want either two.

449
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,800
Among those eighteen people,
ten want popcorn and chips,

450
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,950
two want popcorn and fried chicken,

451
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,470
six want fried chicken and chips.

452
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,760
The respective numbers of people

453
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,440
who only want popcorn, fried chicken
and potato chips

454
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,680
are seven, four, and eight.

455
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,680
Is that correct?

456
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,280
It's only been 10 minutes.

457
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,350
Minus the preparation time,

458
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,800
she probably took lesser time
to calculate it.

459
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,680
Did that dummy become smarter?

460
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,710
Something's not right.

461
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,950
She must have gotten help.

462
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,920
Even if she did,
who would pay this for her?

463
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,440
The bill for these isn't cheap.

464
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,190
(There's 2,210 yuan of expenditure)
What? She paid using my prepaid card.

465
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,520
Miss, how did you manage to calculate this

466
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,880
in such a short time?

467
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,400
I've already had the answer

468
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,830
when the question was given.

469
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,230
These are just primary-level
simultaneous equations.

470
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,230
It might sound confusing

471
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,470
and complex at first.

472
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,990
It's not just at first.

473
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,830
I still find it confusing.

474
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,990
If only I had half your intelligence...

475
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,880
No.

476
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,350
One-tenth.

477
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,280
Then I probably wouldn't get bullied.

478
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,760
You still want to stay
even though you're being bullied?

479
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,950
Why?

480
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,830
Because you like Li Mingcheng?

481
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,560
Say no more.

482
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,760
(Another one like Zhou Shi.)

483
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,280
I guess he's really popular.

484
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,110
I'm not the only one.

485
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,040
The girls in our department,

486
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,040
more or less,

487
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,800
fantasize about him.

488
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,160
Especially Ada.

489
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,400
She's clearly competent enough

490
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,160
to get to a higher position.

491
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,680
Done using the washroom?

492
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,950
Any other openers?

493
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,040
Are you mad?

494
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,520
No.

495
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,230
You probably came to my office

496
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,310
prepared with an excuse.

497
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,110
So I'll skip that.

498
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,680
Anyway,

499
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,560
you're doing this because of me.

500
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,520
You have a lot of confidence, Mr. Li.

501
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,350
As expected from the popular guy in Yunma,

502
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,920
and the face of the Investment Department.

503
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,070
Didn't you think

504
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,880
that I came here
to expand my comfort zone?

505
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Good point.

506
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,640
You'll be with me
during and after work from now on.

507
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,040
It's indeed expanded.

508
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,990
Am I not

509
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,990
your comfort zone?

510
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,710
It's a woman.

511
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,990
Did you see who it was?

512
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,640
Relax. She will show up on her own.

513
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,110
I must get it.

514
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,520
I'm busy.

515
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,640
Another buyer
is interested in those portraits?

516
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,520
I said they're not for sale.

517
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,110
There's nothing to reconsider.

518
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,590
Listen. I'm not selling it at any price.

519
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,830
I've met a lot of people who are like this.

520
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,440
They're just all talk.

521
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,440
I bet he wouldn't give me a mansion.

522
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,710
Yes. I have nowhere to go now.

523
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,280
I want to live in a mansion.

524
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,310
What? What do you mean?

525
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,370
(Regretful Pill)

526
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,400
What's going on these days?

527
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,640
So many plot twists.

528
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,070
He's really willing
to let me stay in his mansion?

529
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,040
Yes.

530
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,560
His only condition
is making the trade on the spot.

531
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,350
I've never met someone so daring.

532
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,070
Wait a second.

533
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,440
He's not planning
to trick me into coming here

534
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,350
to lock me inside,

535
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,950
then accuse me of trespassing

536
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,760
and blackmail me
into selling my work, is he?

537
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,760
Otherwise,
he must have some peculiar taste,

538
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,800
such as playing captivity games.

539
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,070
Mr. Xue.

540
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,800
You're giving me goosebumps.

541
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,950
Why don't we call off the deal?

542
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,040
Call it off?

543
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,110
My curiosity is piqued.

544
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,590
There's no way I'm calling this off.

545
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,190
Talk later. Bye.

546
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,800
Not bad.

547
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,920
I haven't even agreed to sell it.

548
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,400
Are you changing your mind now?

549
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,590
You've got a nice house.

550
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,070
But it's not as nice as mine.

551
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,470
It's still a great house though.

552
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,830
You're being so generous.

553
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,110

I'm telling you one last time.

572
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,640
The person called Ning Fei

573
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,760
could be my past.

574
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,470

Though you're an acquaintance,

577
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,560
I'm still taking this house.

578
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Deal.

579
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,680
Deal?

580
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,830
Ever since I came back,

581
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,920
you're the first person
who accepted it so quickly.

582
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,160
Others usually need a few days
just to accept

583
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,230
that I've lost my memory.

584
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,640
I clearly look handsomer now. Okay?

585
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,680
Looks like you have keen oversight.

586
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,710
"Insight".

587
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
It's the word with radical fire,
the fourth tone.

588
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,350
Pronounced "ju". You illiterate.

589
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,920
Do you really have to say that now?

590
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,470
Do you have something against me?

591
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,350
I shouldn't have come.

Send Dr. Chen over.
