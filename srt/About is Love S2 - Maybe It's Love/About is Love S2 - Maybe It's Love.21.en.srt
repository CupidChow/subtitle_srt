Don't try and piss me off.

00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,480
No one

22
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,230
is going to believe
a tainted person like you.

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,000
The moment I expose your dirty secrets,

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,400
I bet

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,590
none of the shareholders

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,160
will let you continue managing Yunma.

27
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,440
So,

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,830
best for you to do as I say.

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,310
You'll be spared some grub at least.

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,510
There's no need
for everyone to believe him.

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,950
So long as I do.

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,540
(12 years ago)

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,960
Do you like this painting too?

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,270
It is said daily life is best depicted
through oil paintings.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,390
This painting exhibits great depth
and originality.

36
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,110
It must be an expensive piece.

37
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,750
You've got an eye for art.

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,550
Someone once offered 20 million

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,030
to buy this painting.

40
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,470
20 million?

41
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,440
Oh, right.

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,800
Your salary.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Are you really going back
to the country tomorrow?

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,960
This is more than my one year's salary.

45
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,030
Why...

46
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,630
You've been here one month.

47
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,160
I could tell

48
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,520
you're a person with capabilities.

49
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,360
You're underselling yourself
being a security guard.

50
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,470
Use the money to learn some skills.

51
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't waste your talent.

52
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,470
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

53
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,190
Didn't we agree

54
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,910
to do it after he leaves tomorrow?

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,880
You never know if that old man

56
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,190
would take the thing with him.

57
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
We agreed it's purely a heist.

58
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,030
It's a heist if no one's there.
Otherwise, it's robbery.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,030
A painting worth 20 million?
I'll rob if I have to.

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,800
I want you people

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,720
out of the house right now!

62
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,240
Or else I'm calling the police.

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,040
Dad.

64
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,830
Don't die on me.

65
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,640
Dad...

66
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,830
Doctor? Please save my dad.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
Hurry up!

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,350
Dad...

69
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,950
(You've been here one month.)

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,510
(I could tell)

71
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,950
you're a person with capabilities.

72
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,720
(You're underselling yourself
being a security guard.)

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,510
Use the money to learn some skills.

74
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,790
Don't waste your talent.

75
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,480
Is this the police?

76
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,200
I wish to turn myself in.

77
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,720
Take a seat.

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,920
Were you just released from prison?

79
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,510
I got out last week.

80
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
I came back yesterday.

81
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,760
I came to look for you

82
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
right after I paid my respects
to Mr. Wei.

83
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,110
I wanted to apologize to you personally.

84
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,200
Also,

85
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,000
if there's anything I can do
to make it up to you,

86
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,070
please let me know.

87
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,440
How do you plan to make it up to me?

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,880
I know.

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,880
Mr. Wei is gone.

90
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,950
Whatever I do,

91
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,270
it won't make up
for the loss of a loved one.

92
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,510
But

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,070
I hope you'll give me a chance

94
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,160
to redeem myself.

95
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,230
Name a price.

96
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,600
I'll start working tomorrow

97
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,670
and pay you back bit by bit.

98
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,920
I have no shortage of money.

99
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,110
Besides, which company do you think

100
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,350
is willing to hire someone
with a criminal record?

101
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,920
The police showed me
their investigation of you.

102
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,720
You used to be a wandering artist.

103
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,510
Because you couldn't sustain a living
as an artist,

104
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,670
you used your knowledge of artwork

105
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,350
to get into a thieving gang.

106
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,350
You planned to steal paintings,
so you could make some money.

107
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,390
Is that right?

108
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,640
Yes.

109
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,350
At the time,

110
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,160
I found an envelope
at the door of my house.

111
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,000
It contained 10,000 US dollars.

112
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,600
Mr. Wei gave it to me.

113
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,270
He wanted me to go on
with further study.

114
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,160
After what happened to Mr. Wei,

115
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,790
it felt wrong

116
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,390
to keep the money.

117
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,880
Starting tomorrow,

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
come work at my gallery.

119
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,230
You're taking me in?

120
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,000
You want to redeem yourself, right?

121
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,480
You owe my dad your life.

122
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,790
So you'll stay

123
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,320
and manage my dad's gallery.

124
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,270
It's the best form of redemption.

125
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,440
I will do my best.

126
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,480
But can you trust me?

127
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,720
Back then, you turned yourself in

128
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,670
and exposed the gang of thieves.

129
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,510
Now you came to me,

130
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,950
wanting to redeem yourself.

131
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,720
So I'll give you a chance to do so.

132
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,790
Hopefully, I'm not wrong about you.

133
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,640
I promise I won't let you down.

134
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,970
(Wei Heng's cause of death)

135
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,040
Xue Le did a thorough
background check on you.

136
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,640
He's awaiting my reply.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,200
Mr. Wei, what do you propose?

138
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,510
He's got such big dirt on you.

139
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,440
What can you do?

140
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,760
You have to work with him.

141
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,830
So you want me to be an undercover?

142
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,640
Even if he found out everything,

143
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,200
he'd never expect

144
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,790
you to have come clean with me.

145
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,550
So you want me to play along

146
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,160
and find out what his real purpose is?

147
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,160
Snow has entered the Chinese market.

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,270
And Xue Zi is keeping Zhou Shi close.

149
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,320
Somehow, I think there's more to it.

150
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,440
Since they've initiated the challenge,

151
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,320
we'll have to deal with the attacks
as they come.

152
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,670
Rest assured, Mr. Wei.

153
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,720
I'll play my part convincingly.

154
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,400
This is the curtain call.

155
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,000
Wei An.

156
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,230
You did a fine job
acting as the undercover.

157
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,880
All thanks to your guidance, Mr. Wei.

158
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,670
It's a pity though.

159
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,440
I must say Mr. Xue's greed

160
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,400
is very disappointing.

161
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,640
You went to so much trouble

162
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,400
just to grab Yunma's resources
for yourself.

163
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,550
I guess I made a blunder.

164
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,710
I didn't think Mr. Wei

165
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,670
would come around to bite me.

166
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,350
But don't be too smug just yet.

167
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,520
Now, most of Yunma's resources

168
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,230
have been transferred to Shangjue.

169
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,350
We don't yet know who will be

170
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,230
the last one standing.

171
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,350
Wei An.

172
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,910
Haven't you told Mr. Xue

173
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,760
about the biggest bad news?

174
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,030
You showed up too early.

175
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,710
I didn't have the chance to say it.

176
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,350
What is it?

177
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,960
Considering my friendship
with your sister,

178
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
I guess I'll give you a tip.

179
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,000
I used similar methods

180
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,440
to give you a taste
of your own medicine.

181
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,960
Currently,

182
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,320
I am Shangjue's biggest shareholder

183
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,550
and its future chairman.

184
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,030
Mr. Xue, as a human,

185
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,030
we mustn't just look at
what's in front of us.

186
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,880
We need to see what's behind us too.

187
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,960
And most importantly,

188
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,400
do not pick the wrong opponent.

189
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,790
Where are we going, Mr. Wei?

190
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,670
Back to the office?

191
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,640
I want to see Li Mingcheng.

192
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,590
Kevin.

193
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,200
Mr. Xue, I have bad news.

194
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,670
Wei An took your shares and...

195
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,840
They

196
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,550
took everything away.

197
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,030
All the other shareholders have also

198
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,000
handed over their equity.

199
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,880
So you and Wei Qing

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,910
planned everything.

201
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,910
You already knew?

202
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,840
You two were being too obvious.

203
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,030
Plus, the company you interviewed at

204
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,840
was suggested to you by Wei Qing.

205
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
I was already suspecting

206
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
that you two were up to something.

207
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,350
Why didn't you ask me before?

208
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,000
You'd tell me if you wanted to.

209
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,470
I'm sure you had your reason
not to tell me.

210
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,520
So why ask?

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
You're not angry at me, are you?

212
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,080
No, why would I be angry?

213
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,790
This is your work
given by your superior.

214
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,080
I trust in your judgment.

215
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,880
As usual, you know me best.

216
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,400
By the way,

217
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,840
did Wei Qing tell Zhou Shi about this?

218
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,200
He didn't.

219
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,670
That's why I'm a little worried

220
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,320
Shishi may get angry.

221
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,880
It's reasonable to be worried.

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,710
I'll get it.

223
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,440
Is your wife in?

224
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,910
Yes. What's the matter?

225
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,790
I came to apologize to her for you.

226
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,840
There's no need.
Mingcheng's told me everything.

227
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,880
Anyway, have you told

228
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,080
Zhou Shi about this?

229
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,880
Not yet.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I wanted to let you know first.

231
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,110
Then I'll tell her tonight at dinner.

232
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,200
My advice

233
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,640
is to tell her after you have dinner.

234
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,670
Otherwise, I reckon

235
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,080
you won't be eating anything.

236
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,230
Do you mean

237
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,000
she'll be very angry?

238
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,910
I'm going to leave.

239
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,000
Why are you leaving?

240
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,790
Did you prepare all this?

241
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,230
How is it? Is it pretty?

242
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,550
Hold on.

243
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,840
Is it because I've been so busy

244
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,840
that I forgot some anniversary today?

245
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,030
What are you doing?

246
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,350
Let go first.

247
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,400
No, I won't.

248
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,910
Are you trying to propose again?

249
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,760
Did you have to burst my bubble?

250
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,320
This is already my third time
proposing to you.

251
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,400
I'm hoping to have a good outcome.

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,350
I barely came off a huge blow.

253
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,110
Are you that ruthless

254
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,710
in giving me another one?

255
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,760
Is that so?

256
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,280
This is the third
marriage proposal already?

257
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,470
So should I pretend

258
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,910
to be surprised?

259
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,470
These flowers are so beautiful!
Did you buy them?

260
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,350
Why did you buy flowers?

261
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,760
It's Xue Zi.

262
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,350
Hold on.

263
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,640
I...

264
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,520
It got off on the wrong foot.

265
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,000
Ms. Xue.

266
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,590
Go to Yunma tomorrow.

267
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,320
(Wei An, Assistant Manager of Yunma Group)
I want you

268
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,320
to see to Shangjue's share transfer
on behalf of Snow.

269
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,910
Share transfer?

270
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,440
What do you mean?

271
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,080
We've been played by Wei Qing.

272
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,880
Wei Qing and Wei An's ruse
of being the victim

273
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,640
won them support on both sides
to merge with Shangjue.

274
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,280
Are you sure you're unaware of it?

275
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,910
I am unaware.

276
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,960
Really?

277
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,200
I would've assumed

278
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,760
he sent you to spy on me.

279
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,670
No, I...

280
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,760
He didn't tell me anything.

281
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,710
I guess he doesn't trust you
all that much.

282
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,640
Alright, I got it, Ms. Xue.

283
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,030
I will handle the matter of Shangjue.

284
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,200
That's all.

285
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,080
Ning.

286
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,710
Ning.

287
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,150
What is it?

288
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,030
Didn't you hear me calling?

289
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,320
I was playing games. I didn't hear you.

290
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,470
Continue the game later. Let's talk.

291
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,200
Talk about what?

292
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,960
A way to make the others forget

293
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,280
the old Ning Fei for good

294
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,960
and accept the current you.

295
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,710
Do you want to talk about it?

296
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,110
What is the plan?

297
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,550
Are you done?

298
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,590
The mood is already dissipating.

299
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
What's the matter?

300
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,520
Did something happen?

301
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,790
Do you have something to tell me?

302
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,840
I do. Since I came in,

303
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,590
I've not had the chance to say it.

304
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Not the proposal. Something else.

305
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,790
(My advice)

306
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,150
is to tell her after you have dinner.

307
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,110
Otherwise, I reckon

308
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:38,542
you won't be eating anything.

309
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,840
Do you mean

310
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,520
she'll be very angry?

311
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,030
Let me explain.

312
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,000
I was going to tell you after I propose.

313
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,550
Tell me after you propose?

314
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,840
So you wanted me to put on the ring

315
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,640
so that I wouldn't be able to regret it?

316
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,640
No.

317
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,640
I thought it'd be better
to lighten the mood first.

318
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,110
Then it's easier to disregard

319
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,080
unhappy things like that.

320
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,760
Disregard the unhappy things.

321
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,400
Then continue being
your clueless, sweet girl?

322
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,880
Did you not tell me

323
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,350
because you worried
I might stop you and Wei An

324
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,950
from carrying out such a low-class act?

325
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,160
All this while,

326
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,950
I've been blindsided like a fool.

327
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,520
You even got me involved.

328
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,640
You made me keep an eye on Xue Zi

329
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,110
in case she did something.

330
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,680
I tried so hard to cheer you up,

331
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,950
to make you get back on your feet.

332
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,590
I must have

333
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,230
looked like a joke to you.

334
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,520
That's not true.

335
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,430
The reason I didn't tell you

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,520
is that I thought

337
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,640
it would be safer for you not to know.

338
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,830
You're always

339
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,950
- by their side.
- So you were afraid

340
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,430
I'd leak information,

341
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,000
or that I'd betray you?

342
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,400
No, I...

343
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,350
Forget it.

344
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,680
If

345
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,710
you can't see what your mistake is,

346
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,110
I won't forgive you.

347
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,560
I...

348
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,070
If you can't even be honest with me,

349
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,400
why bother with marriage?

350
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,700
(Director's Office)

351
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,400
Morning, Mingcheng.

352
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,470
You're here.

353
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,470
Sit.

354
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,520
Mr. Wei isn't with you?

355
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,110
Why would he be with me?

356
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,280
Did you guys have a fight?

357
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,280
Mingcheng.

358
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,590
About Wei Qing's pity act,

359
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,110
did you know about it?

360
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,710
You did?

361
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,070
I only found out halfway.

362
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,800
Mr. Wei asked me to go for an interview

363
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,800
as a cover to acquire and merge
Shangjue's fractional shares.

364
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,830
Actually, Mr. Wei
didn't tell you because...

365
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,000
Save it.

366
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't want to talk about it now.

367
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,710
Mingcheng.

368
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,230
I'm here representing Snow

369
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,350
to go over Shangjue's
handover process with you.

370
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,830
He's told you, right?

371
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,830
Yes.

372
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
But give me a moment.

373
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,160
I need Mr. Wei's signature
on the debriefing report

374
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,800
before I can proceed with the handover.

375
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,470
That's fine. I've informed Xue Zi.

376
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,590
I will go back
only when the matter is done.

377
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,400
Are you still going back to Snow?

378
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,800
Mr. Wei.

379
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,560
Are you really going back?

380
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,680
Yes, I am Snow's employee
and shareholder.

381
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,230
Where should I go if not back to Snow?

382
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,950
Come to my office.

383
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,190
Shishi, here's the contract.

384
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,880
To be fair, what Mr. Wei did

385
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,000
was out of consideration for you.

386
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,590
Professionally,

387
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,160
this matter involved trade secrets.

388
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,640
The fewer people know, the better.

389
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
That ensures a better rate of success.

390
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,880
Privately, you and Mr. Wei

391
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,110
are too close.

392
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,110
That will surely
put the spotlight on you.

393
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,430
If you knew beforehand,

394
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,520
it could give the plan away.

395
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,430
Once exposed,

396
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,110
it could put you in danger.

397
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,560
So it was better not to tell you.

398
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,470
Mingcheng.

399
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Did you tell Miss Brainiac about this?

400
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,400
I only told her yesterday.

401
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,280
Before that, I had kept it from her.

402
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,190
What did she say then?

403
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,880
She said she trusted my decision.

404
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,310
If I didn't tell her on purpose,

405
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,350
there must be a reason for it.

406
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,280
Miss Brainiac always sees
the bigger picture.

407
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,070
What is it?

408
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Are you saying

409
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,470
I can't see past the obvious?

410
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,280
I didn't say that.

411
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,800
That's right.

412
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,520
I am narrow-minded.

413
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,430
Or else I wouldn't be so worried.

414
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,430
I wouldn't have nightmares every day

415
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,560
of you getting hurt.

416
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,400
I wouldn't lose concentration at work

417
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,520
because I worried
you might do something stupid at home.

418
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,710
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,160
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

420
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,760
Keeping it from me is fine.

421
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,160
It's also fine not to tell me your plan.

422
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,470
But at least give me a heads up.

423
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,000
Tell me not to worry

424
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,680
because you already know what to do.

425
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
And not keeping me in the dark,

426
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,110
using me as a chess piece
in your perfect plan.

427
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,400
That's all I ask.

428
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,520
Mingcheng.

429
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,880
I have to check with Ms. Xue

430
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,880
on this contract first.

431
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,040
Can you put me somewhere quiet?

432
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,230
Okay.

433
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,040
Miss Brainiac.

434
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,950
Are you really not angry with Mingcheng?

435
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,680
I'm not.

436
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,880
But you can't really compare

437
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,520
Wei Qing to Mingcheng in this matter.

438
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,520
Let me tell you.

439
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,830
Men are all like that.

440
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,400
They never consider
other people's feelings.

441
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,470
They're just selfish,
doing whatever they please.

442
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,880
Feifei is there too?

443
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,470
Has she been drinking?

444
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
Don't you have a shoot today?

445
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,470
I'm currently taking a break.

446
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,520
Passive leave and active unemployment

447
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,950
are two different matters, okay?

448
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,640
What...

449
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,710
Unemployment?

450
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,950
Shangjue has been acquired.

451
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,430
Funding for the drama is cut.

452
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,680
The production crew was told to stop.

453
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,230
Now, Ning Fei is nowhere
to be found. So,

454
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,350
she's experiencing

455
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,680
a double whammy of career and love.

456
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,470
I totally forgot about this.

457
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,110
Sorry, Feifei.

458
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,920
Why are you apologizing?

459
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,520
Yunma acquiring Shangjue

460
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,160
is a business deal.

461
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,590
What has it got to do with you?

462
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,560
Not bad. That's the way.

463
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,280
You're being positive
and thinking straight.

464
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,230
Here's a "like" for you.

465
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,070
Save your sugar-coated bullets.

466
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,680
You'll be paying for dinner tonight.

467
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,680
You know what, Zhou Shi?

468
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,640
She told me her husband

469
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,070
accumulated all of Yunma's shares.

470
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,710
And so,

471
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,280
I'm going to extort the rich tonight

472
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,310
and make her bleed.

473
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,110
So, what about

474
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,830
joining us for some fun tonight?

475
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,350
There won't be any shortage
of criticizing Little Devil and Wei Qing.

476
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,680
Okay. I'll go right after I get off work.

477
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,710
Wait for me.

478
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,160
Okay. We'll be waiting.

479
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,470
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

480
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,350
Li Mingcheng?

481
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,190
Mr. Wei.

482
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,040
Did you come to pick Shishi up?

483
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,350
That must mean Zhou Shi is here.

484
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,110
Yes.

485
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,520
Why aren't you going up?

486
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,830
Qiujing called to say

487
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,400
the three of them

488
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,800
are having a ladies' night.

489
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
She asked me to wait at home.

490
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,640
I worried they might get drunk,

491
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,880
so I came to take a look.

492
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,880
But I don't want to interrupt them,
so I didn't go in.

493
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,070
Are you not worried

494
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,350
about your position in the household?

495
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,590
Position in the household?

496
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,470
My wife is always number one.

497
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,070
I don't suppose

498
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,400
you disagree on that point.

499
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,920
I get it now.

500
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,560
Including the rascal, Ning Fei,

501
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,560
all three of us are pretty much
suffering brothers.

502
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,680
So you're just going to wait out here?

503
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,000
The three girlfriends are chatting.

504
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,280
It's not very nice of me to interrupt.

505
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,430
Do I have to spell it out for you?

506
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,280
You can't expect me to go up by myself.

507
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,400
If you don't dare to go up,

508
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,190
you could stay and wait here with me.

509
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,520
You have two options.

510
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,920
One, we sink or swim together.

511
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,520
Two, a permanent termination.

512
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,680
Come on. Are you doing this again?

513
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,400
Honey.

514
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,710
Why are you here?

515
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,230
I came with Mr. Wei.

516
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,640
Good job pointing the finger.

517
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,230
You know what?

518
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,000
Ning Fei brought stray cats home
all the time and bathed them.

519
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,920
And he used my expensive towels

520
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,430
to dry them.

521
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,230
That's not a big deal.

522
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,000
Let me tell you about Wei Qing.

523
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,470
Whenever he plays games,
he wants to win.

524
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,040
If he loses, he blames it on me!

525
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,640
They drank a lot.

526
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,310
They're competing to see which boyfriend
is more annoying.

527
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,400
There are already
more than 20 complaints.

528
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,070
Let me see.

529
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,640
There's more.

530
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,310
The most unforgivable thing.

531
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
He always makes decisions for me
on his own.

532
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Miss Brainiac.

533
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,310
Remember that...

534
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,560
Do you see him?

535
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,760
Wei Qing?

536
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,470
Come over here.

537
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,070
Stand here.

538
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,880
Say it to his face.
You'll feel even better.

539
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,710
Yes.

540
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,230
Say it to his face.

541
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,560
Always apologizing but never changing.

542
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,160
And he's doubting my ability?

543
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,680
Go ahead. Scold me however you want,

544
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,110
until you feel better.

545
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
You're going to tell me
how I should feel?

546
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,800
Well, I'm pissed!

547
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,760
Honey.

548
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,520
For the sake of humanism,

549
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,830
you have to sacrifice a little

550
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,470
and divert the bombardment.

551
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,520
What is it?

552
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,040
I'm helping you divert firepower.

553
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,760
Get ready for double the bonus
next month.

554
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,830
Hey, it's fine if you can't think of it.

555
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,040
How about this? I present my husband

556
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,110
for you to criticize.

557
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,430
You two can switch your target for a bit.

558
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,400
You, Li Mingcheng! Your cooking...

559
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,950
is flawless.

560
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,640
Ning Fei.

561
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,310
He just sits there,
waiting for us to feed him.

562
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,800
And you.

563
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,920
When you fight with Bi Qiujing...

564
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,710
Has he ever fought with you?

565
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,160
No?

566
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,310
Not like Ning Fei.

567
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,430
He argues with me every day.

568
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,310
And I have to coax him.

569
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,110
Mingcheng is considerate and gentle.

570
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,310
While Wei Qing is always full of himself!

571
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,590
Are you dispersing the firepower

572
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,400
or adding more onto me?

573
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,190
I'm trying to be low profile.

574
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,710
But my capabilities say otherwise.

575
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,800
Come.

576
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
Let me go!

577
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm not done!

578
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,830
Wait up!

579
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,710
Feifei!

580
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,590
Darling.

581
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,040
Lin Feifei, where are you going?

582
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,160
You only ever say nice things.

583
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,680
But you've never truly cared

584
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,190
about what it is I want.

585
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,280
Every time I get angry,

586
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,350
you assume I'm throwing a tantrum.

587
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,760
You obviously don't understand me.

588
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,190
But you pretend

589
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,830
like you know me so well.

590
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,800
I'm sorry.

591
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,280
Everything you've said, I admit it.

592
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,400
But please trust me one more time.

593
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,040
I know.

594
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,760
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

595
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,950
I know I shouldn't have let you

596
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,160
feel worried and scared.

597
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,070

(The sandwiches are crooked.
Hope you don't mind.)

620
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,400
He's being self-aware.

621
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:18,970
(Thanks for your...)

622
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,590
No, I must not be blinded
by these little acts.

623
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,070
Ms. Xue.

624
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm downstairs. I'll be right up.

625
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,710
Zhou Shi!

626
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,000
Here you are.

627
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,680
Where have you been?

628
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,830
Don't you know
we were all worried about you?

629
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,560
Zhou Shi.

630
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,950
It's me.

631
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,880
Fei?

632
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,710
You've regained your memory?

633
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,680
I don't have time to go into detail.

634
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,040
I have something
very important to tell you.

635
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,070
Hold on a second.

636
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,070
Sorry, Ms. Xue.

637
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,350
I forgot to sign a copy

638
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,640
of the Shangjue transfer agreement.

639
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,710
I'll go back to Yunma now

640
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,310
and deliver it to you
first thing tomorrow.

641
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,950
Bye.

642
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,400
Come on, let's go home.

643
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,520
Feifei.

644
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,430
Feifei!

645
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,590
Wake up, Feifei!

646
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,710
Why are you being so loud
in the morning?

647
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,040
I still have a bad hangover right now.

648
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,350
Feifei.

649
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,920
The little rascal found his way home.

650
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,800
Go on, tell me what trouble
you've caused.

651
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,680
Xue Ning! What is wrong with you?

652
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,880
Feifei.

653
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,830
It's me.

654
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,070
No, I have to make sure.

655
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,000
Zhou Shi.

656
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,470
Are you sure
he's not pretending to be Fei

657
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,710
so as not to get scolded?

658
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,710
Don't worry. I interrogated him
along the way.

659
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,920
He's Fei.

660
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,560
No, no, no.

661
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,280
I can't fall for his tricks again.

662
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,350
Wait, I need to think of a way

663
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,400
to ascertain that he truly is Fei.

664
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,680
Wait for me.

665
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,920
I'm hungry.

666
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,920
Can you check after we eat?

667
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,430
Zhou Shi, I'd like to have
your instant noodles.

668
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,470
With two fried eggs.

669
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,640
It's really you.

670
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,560
Did you drink?

671
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,710
No.

672
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,800
