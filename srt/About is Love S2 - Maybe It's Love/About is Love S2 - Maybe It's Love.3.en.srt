16
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,210
(Yunma Mountain Gallery Hotel)

17
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,194
(Two years later)

18
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:06,357
As expected from Mr. Wei.

19
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:08,796
He was mentioned
in the entertainment section,

20
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:10,637
and now, he's in the economics section.

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,300
(Curator)

22
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:17,716
Yes, Curator?

23
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,800
Your photographs have arrived.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,479
Should we set them up

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,039
for you?

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,039
Yes, please. Hang the promotional photo

27
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,239
by the entrance of the exhibition hall.

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,080
Across the second right window.

29
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,479
The lighting there is marvelous.

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,560
Have you been to our hotel before?

31
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,959
You are very familiar

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,039
with our layout.

33
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,920
I was there once a long time ago.

34
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,239
But I suppose

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,800
you must have been promoted.

36
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:42,720
Then...

37
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,959
Keep the other paintings
in the storeroom.

38
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,720
I'll have my people set up the rest.

39
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,800
Thank you.

40
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,599
Okay.

41
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,200
How odd.

42
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,560
Do I know a foreign curator?

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,000
Where are you?

44
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,160
Well,

45
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,679
I'll be in the city in a few hours.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
Are you waiting for human evolution?

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,840
You can't be any slower than that.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
I want to go faster too.

49
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,800
Speeding up now? Independent already?

50
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,519
Your ex must be your entire world,

51
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,560
you traitor.

52
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,119
So you flew back

53
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,920
to rekindle a relationship?

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,879
Boss.

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
Don't misuse that expression.

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,519
Also, don't trust
your brother's message.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,959
I'm back here to see a friend.

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,119
Drive faster then.

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
I bet one spicy strip
that you can't see him.

60
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:37,599
Marry me.

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,920
Cut!

62
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,599
Cut! Cut!

63
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,879
Feifei, you're being proposed,

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,399
not being tortured.

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,879
Why do you look

66
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,200
so resentful?

67
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,519
I just don't get it.

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,840
You did other scenes in one take,

69
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,280
so how did this proposal scene
stump you?

70
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,319
Sorry, Director.

71
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,479
I wasn't in the right state just now.

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,360
Just give me another chance.

73
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,080
It'll be done in one take.

74
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
No, thanks!

75
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,360
Just rest and get your mojo back.

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,160
All right. Take a break now.

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Bao!

78
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,440
Sorry, Jason. I...

79
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,560
If she can't act, don't bring her here.

80
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,720
Producer!

81
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,440
Bring me the casting director.

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Excuse me.

83
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,440
(If I keep stuttering like this,)

84
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,840
(my sponsor will just get rid of me.)

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,440
(Hong is not here.)

86
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
(Who can I practice the script with?)

87
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,560
Miss Lin?

88
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:05,040
Are you from the camera crew?

89
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,720
No.

90
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,760
So the sponsor sent you here then.

91
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,119
May I know your name?

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,760
Neil.

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,119
Okay.

94
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,199
Can you do me a favor?

95
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,840
He's so good-looking!

96
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,639
Ms. Bi.

97
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,199
I promise
I'll come to your class every day.

98
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,880
Darling, I'm here to pick you up.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,760
Didn't I say 6 PM?

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,399
Can't I come here early just to see you?

101
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,040
Of course you can.

102
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,519
Let's go.

103
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,720
So the man left the ring

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,359
and asked the woman to wait for him.

105
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:01,480
But he disappeared without a trace.

106
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,199
Did the woman look for him?

107
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,799
It's not important.

108
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:08,959
Just

109
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,720
act like I told you.

110
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,639
Let me think.

111
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,199
How would a man propose?

112
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,280
Don't go anywhere.

113
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,799
I'll marry you...

114
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,519
when I come back.

115
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
You brat.

116
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,480
I said I wouldn't wait for you.

117
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,519
Do you not understand a word?

118
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,519
I'm almost 30 already.

119
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,959
How many years
do I have to wait for you?

120
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,040
Since you care so much
about your sister,

121
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,600
go spend the rest of your life with her.

122
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,040
Who will say yes to a proposal

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,440
from a brat like you?

124
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,119
Miss Lin?

125
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,239
Miss Lin?

126
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,399
Okay, I'm done now.

127
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,679
So...

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,359
You're okay with this scene now?

129
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,880
I suppose so.

130
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:26,760
Thank you

131
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,560
for letting me yell at you
for no reason.

132
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,600
But this thing is...

133
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,679
I know, you're acting.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,959
I get it.

135
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,600
Then,

136
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,560
all the best.

137
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,679
Thanks.

138
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,079
To thank you,

139
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll do it in one take.

140
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,079
Bye.

141
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,359
Cut! Good.

142
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,919
Not bad. This scene is done.

143
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,040
Next one!

144
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,880
Jason, have a rest.

145
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
The jewelry from Shangjue
is simply exquisite.

146
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,079
No matter how you shoot it,
it looks amazing.

147
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,280
Don't you agree, Mr. Xue?

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,399
You're skilled in your craft too,
Director. Also...

149
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,079
the model has to look good.

150
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,079
You're right.

151
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,840
I shall prepare the next scene now.

152
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,040
Mr. Xue, you have a meeting
this afternoon.

153
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:44,160
With Mr. Wei from Yunma Group.

154
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,399
I know.

155
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,120
Let's go. The break is long enough.

156
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,999
Time for business now.

157
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:11,519
Wait for me here.

158
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,680
Okay.

159
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,720
So thanks to the cute guy,

160
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,240
you managed to overcome the hurdle
in your heart?

161
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,399
It's not exactly a hurdle.

162
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,680
I'm not seeing anyone

163
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,160
because I want to improve my career.

164
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:25,040
I'm not waiting for you-know-who.

165
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,216
Not a hurdle then.

166
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:27,120
It's been two years,

167
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,920
so it must have become a trauma.

168
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,959
Excuse me?

169
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:35,040
You have a husband,
so of course, you're...

170
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,559
Oh,

171
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,319
don't forget what day it is today.

172
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,480
I won't.

173
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,950
(Today is Zhou Shi's birthday)

174
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,399
Mr. Wei, the guest is here.

175
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,959
Mr. Xue, is it?

176
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,600
Your reputation precedes you.

177
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,240
I'm Wei Qing.

178
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,199
Unable to find a route.

179
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,999
Feel free to roam around.

180
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,120
Good luck!

181
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,399
What a waste of time.

182
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,120
Where am I now?

183
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,759
Don't move!

184
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:42,160
Come here.

185
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,360
Stay still.

186
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,519
Darn you.

187
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:02,840
Stop thrashing.

188
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,600
Let me record your statement.

189
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,959
Your name?

190
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:08,999
Wu Xiao.

191
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,160
W, u. X, i, a, o.

192
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:17,800
Sir,

193
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,559
where is the woman who saved me?

194
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,959
I did not see anyone else.

195
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,439
Didn't you call the police?

196
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:24,280
Are you injured?

197
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,959
I'm fine.

198
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,639
Mr. Wei.

199
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,519
Everything is fine

200
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,959
with this partnership proposal.

201
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,559
It's just that the price

202
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,480
is way higher than our budget.

203
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,360
Can you please

204
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,400
(Asian Art Biennal Cooperation Project)
reconsider the price?

205
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,040
Mr. Xue, you grew up overseas.

206
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,639
I wonder if you have heard of

207
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,639
the expression,
"rare things are more valuable"?

208
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,759
The spots in the Asian Art Biennial

209
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,079
are competitive, to begin with.

210
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,999
They are intangible
but highly sought after.

211
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,999
You should know better than me.

212
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,879
If you want a spot,

213
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
you need to show some sincerity

214
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,280
with your offer.

215
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
The spots might be expensive,

216
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,639
but you don't have all of them, do you?

217
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,759
If you can collaborate with Shangjue
and exhibit together,

218
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:31,879
it will boost Yunma's brand effect too.

219
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,160
Not to mention the partnership with Snow
that comes after.

220
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,519
Mr. Wei, set your eyes on the future.

221
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,439
Sorry.

222
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,319
Personally,

223
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,559
I like

224
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,720
short-term gain. After all,

225
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,680
things can always change.

226
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,040
Two people who were still together
several days ago

227
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,240
might part ways the next day.

228
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,240
I lost faith

229
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,920
in promises two years ago.

230
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,680
Besides,

231
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,360
Shangjue is your private brand.

232
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,559
It's not part of Snow Group's asset.

233
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,399
Since you already established
your own brand,

234
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,240
why do you still use Snow's name then?

235
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,040
I never like to

236
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,759
force a deal.

237
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,399
Mr. Xue, you can

238
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,680
mull this partnership over

239
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,759
before deciding.

240
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,240
Wei An.

241
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,720
Mr. Xue.

242
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,879
How did the negotiation
go with Wei Qing?

243
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,519
Forget about it.
Contact other jewelry brands for me.

244
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,920
The man in charge is currently abroad

245
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
and can't be reached.

246
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,559
I heard that they have met

247
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,480
with Wei Qing beforehand.

248
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,959
It seems like

249
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,439
we're at our wit's end here.

250
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:05,639
Wei Qing.

251
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,759
He actually went this far.

252
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
Does he have no shame whatsoever?

253
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,079
He has a moniker, you know.

254
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,999
Gentlemen Killer.

255
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,360
He is ruthless towards gentlemen.

256
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:19,639
If he finds your weak spot,

257
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,680
he strikes right away.

258
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,280
His barbarous style

259
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,639
is just like that woman's.

260
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,759
Mr. Xue.

261
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,920
Do we continue the negotiation?

262
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,160
Our chairperson

263
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,040
will get hold
of this failed negotiation soon.

264
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,360
And she hates failures.

265
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,879
She will send someone here

266
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:38,959
to take over us soon.

267
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,079
We have to strike a deal
with Wei Qing quickly then.

268
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,959
Does he not have a weakness?

269
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,920
Zhou Shi!

270
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,040
Your engine stalled. It's a goner.

271
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,680
Goodbye to your ex.

272
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,040
Shut up.

273
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,079
Xue Le.

274
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,959
His English name is Neil Snow.

275
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,040
He's the youngest son
of the owner of the Snow Group.

276
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,639
He was the rightful heir
of the Snow Group,

277
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,559
but he lost to Xue Zi,

278
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,319
also known as Zoey Snow,
in the company's

279
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,120
in-fighting.

280
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,199
He was then sent to China

281
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,680
to handle some sub-brands.

282
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,319
In reality, he was removed

283
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,600
from the decision-making level.

284
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,559
Xue Le's business scope includes

285
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,920
his own jewelry brand, Shangjue,

286
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,399
and other domains that the Snow Group

287
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,040
rarely steps foot on,

288
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,040
like entertainment,

289
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,840
internet, AI,

290
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,879
capital operations, and...

291
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:14,160
Mr. Wei?

292
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,480
Mr. Wei?

293
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,319
Wei Qing. Wei Qing.

294
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,439
Are you awake?

295
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
Are you feeling unwell?

296
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,840
(I know this is just an illusion.)

297
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,720
(This is not the first time
she appeared)

in the past two years.)

(All I can do now)

300
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,199
(is to pray that the time
will move slower here.)

301
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,240
Don't worry.

302
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,040
As long as you're here with me,

303
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,199
I'll be fine.

304
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:51,559
Ouch!

305
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,600
Quit it now.

306
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,480
Let me go. I'm going to die.

307
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,199
(Chen Liyun's Psychology Clinic)
Your allergy is cured.

308
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,439
And now,
you're having a delusional disorder.

309
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,800
Not only do you need
to treat your brain,

310
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,280
but your eyes will also...

(Ophthalmology Consultation)
(Abnormal)

312
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,800
I just remember

313
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,600
I have a meeting at 5 PM.
I have to go now.

314
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,760
Sit.

315
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,319
Lie down.

316
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
You have been having episodes lately.

317
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,959
Has everything ever turned dark

318
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,799
and your eyesight turned blurry
out of a sudden?

319
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:27,079
I know what you have been through
these two years.

320
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,559
The more pain we endure,

321
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,199
the more reliant we are on distractions.

322
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,600
You did not pick medicine.

323
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,159
Instead, you work to forget.

324
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,760
It's not a bad thing,

325
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:37,159
but you can't keep this up anymore.

326
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,720
I know.

327
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,679
I will cut down

328
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:41,959
on my workload.

329
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,880
I'm not just referring to your work.

330
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:45,880
It's time for you

331
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,000
to let go of Zhou Shi.

332
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,439
I know you're right.

333
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,559
But I can't do it.

334
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,159
You can't

335
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,520
let go of Zhou Shi

336
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,279
or you can't accept the fact
that she abandoned you?

337
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,959
I know facing it is difficult.

338
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:04,319
But if you don't take the first step,

339

you will forever be stuck
in two years ago.

I will find a way as soon as possible.

343
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,840
Although

344
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,079
I don't know where to begin.

345
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,240
Perhaps return

346
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,079
to where you two met?

347
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,025
(Shanju Gallery Hotel)

348
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,720
Maybe returning to the root
will allow you to begin anew.

349
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,500
(Yunma Mountain Gallery Hotel)

350
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,270
(Exhibition of New Photographers)
(Organizer: Xue Ning)

351
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,559
Why does the woman in this photograph

352
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,319
look so familiar?

353
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,050
(Chairperson)

354
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,840
Yes, Mr. Wei?

355
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,240
What?

356
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,679
Send a driver to pick you up?

357
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:54,720
Wait.

358
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,720
You didn't drive?

359
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,079
Why?

360
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,959
I can't take the bus now?

361
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,159
Of course, you can.

362
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,319
For your sojourn here,

363
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,640
should I find you

364
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,039
a housekeeper?

365
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,679
(Now)

366
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,240
(is your chance
to make up for your mistake.)

367
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,199
(Be the chairperson's housekeeper!)

368
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,240
Fulfill these two requirements.

369
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:19,199
One, be my beck and call when I need you,

370
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,679
and stay away from me when I don't.

371
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,520
Can you do it?

372
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,760
I guess so?

373
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,199
Don't sound uncertain.

374
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,199
You're not an elementary school student.

375
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,520
Yes or no?

376
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,360
Yes.

377
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,400
I can.

378
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,480
It's fine.

379
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,640
I want some time alone.

380
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,840
Just arrange it accordingly.

381
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,919
My car has broken down.

382
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,400
You know what?

383
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,279
Find someone to tow my car
to the automobile workshop.

384
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,559
I'll deal with the rest myself.

385
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,279
Stop it, Wei Qing.

386
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,480
You have to imagine a bystander now too?

387
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,679
Where are you?

388
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,720
How can I pick you up?

389
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,159
I need to go somewhere.

390
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,720
I'll send you my location.

391
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,840
Bye.

392
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,360
Wang.

393
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,799
Hurry up!

394
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:38,799
Okay.

395
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:39,880
Li, are all of you ready?

396
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,079
Go to the entrance now.

397
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:41,600
Okay.

398
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,319
Hurry up!

399
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:57,799
Mr. Wei.

400
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,039
Where are you?

401
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,319
I missed my stop.

402
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,439
What? You did?

403
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,959
Oh, dear me.

404
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,000
How could the staff

405
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,480
be this careless?

406
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,159
They should have waken you up.

407
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,520
Shut up.

408
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,840
Mr. Wei, An is here.

409
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,799
Where are you now?

410
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,159
Perhaps I can ask him to pick you up?

411
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:19,880
The last stop.

413
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:27,880

00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,279

Do you think making a wish
during a meteor shower

474
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,600
works?

475
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,039
Do you know how the Perseids

476
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,279
come about?

477
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,720
When the Comet Swift-Tuttle

478
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,959
approaches the sun,

479
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,959
its icy core

480
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,559
will eject a lot of small particles.

481
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,959
These particles create friction
with our atmosphere

482
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,159
and they become the meteor shower
that you see here.

483
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,319
So?

484
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,120
So making a wish during a meteor shower

485
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,840
is like picking up a stone outside.

486
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,319
You can't dismiss it like that.

487
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,520
The Perseids

488
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,959
are also called
the Tears of Saint Lawrence.

489
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,600
Apparently, they are the seeds of hope
planted by Gods.

490
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,279
According to the legends,
if the ones see them

491
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,480
make a wish, the wish will come true.

492
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,799
See? Your husband
is so much more poetic.

493
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:00,640
But

494
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,480
judging from the speed of sound
in the air,

495
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,959
when your wish reaches
the meteor shower,

496
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,240
they will be on the ground already.

497
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,360
So, we need a special tactic.

498
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,328
(Give Zhou Shi back!)

499
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,279
Light travels 300,000 km per second.

500
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,319
More than enough
to reach the atmosphere.

501
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,120
Now. Hurry up. Quickly.

502
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,240
Grant me my wish!

503
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,240

512
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,720
Shut up.

513
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,400
I just want to fit in, okay?

514
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,360
Also,

515
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,159
wish-making is not science.

516
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,360
It can't possibly come true.

517
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:20,159
Well,

518
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,400
did all of you

519
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,600
get the same text?

520
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:29,799
Wei An.

521
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,959
Do you believe in wishes?

522
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,120
I don't.

523
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,000
If all wishes can come true,

524
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,679
no one has to work hard anymore.

525
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,679
More often than not,

526
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,400
it's a kind of escapism.

527
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
Then

528
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,919
do you believe in goals?

529
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,240
Mr. Wei, I don't believe in wishes,

530
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,039
but if you make a sincere wish

531
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,439
and fate wills it,

532
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,079
you will meet her again.

533
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,199
Thank you.

534
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,079
I'm done now.

535
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,079
You can go back.

536
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,360
Okay.

537
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:24,600
(A sincere wish and fate.)

538
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,400
(But if she is not coming back,)

539
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,600
(how long can I remember her for?)

540
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:52,959
Wei An.

541
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:57,679
Yes, Mr. Wei?

542
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,959
How may I help?

543
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,159
Is there

544
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
a power cut in the hotel?

545
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
No.

546
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,000
I see.

547
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:14,880
Mr. Wei.

548
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,400
What happened?

549
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:26,199
I'm fine.

550
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,799
I might

551
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,799
be blind now.

552
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,240
Or perhaps it was a trick of the eye.

553
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,319
I thought she came back.

554
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,360
She said she was by the door.
Do you believe her?

555
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,959
Must be a prank or a hacker.

556
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,640
I don't want to hear any of it now.

557
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,240
I'm back.

558
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,000
Happy birthday to me.

559
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,559
All of you

560
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,120
held this birthday party for me.

561
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,640
Why are you so quiet?

562
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,720
I need to touch up my makeup.

563
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,679
I need to slap some sense into my brain.

564
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:08,279
Why are you here too?

565
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,439
It's so awkward.

566
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,840
A reunion like this

567
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,240
is too emotional for me.

568
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,079
Li Mingcheng might feel that way too,
you know.

569
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,439
But he's cheeky. He'll be fine.

570
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,400
Welcome back, Shishi.

571
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,880
Where have you been

572
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,480
these two years?

573
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,039
I went to Paris.

574
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,279
I found a really good team,
so I've worked with them ever since.

575
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,400
There will be an exhibition soon here,

576
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,720
so I came back.

577
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,720
Oh, right.

578
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,240
I forgot to tell you.

579
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,760
I'm now a curator.

580
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:39,959
Curator?

581
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,120
You don't draw anymore?

582
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,240
Not necessarily.

583
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,319
At least I'm still in the same industry,

584
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,919
still dealing with arts.

585
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:54,360
But it's different.

586
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,240
Shishi, tell me.

587
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
What happened two years ago?

588
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,319
Two years ago?

589
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,720
You must be referring to

590
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,880
that thing.

591
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,720
Mingcheng.

592
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,319
Do you love Bi Qiujing?

593
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:18,400
What the...

594
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,039
Why drag me into this?

595
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:23,559
Of course, I do.

596
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,439
Why else would I marry her then?

597
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,600
Still so romantic
after three years of marriage.

598
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,760
You found a keeper.

599
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,039
Shut up!

600
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,000
What does this have anything
to do with the question I asked?

601
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,319
Another question.

602
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,799
If one day, you and her separated,

603
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,760
how would you explain it
to everyone around you?

604
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,919
Everyone knows you two
are deeply in love,

605
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,039
and they would die to know
what happened.

606
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,559
But you didn't want to go into details

607
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,799
about the reason.

608
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,400
What would

609
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:55,720
you do?

610
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,039
Ghosting

611
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,480
or

612
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,159
disappearing.

613
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,640
Exactly.

614
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:05,720
That was what happened to me.

615
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:09,919
Wait, it's a trap.

616
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,880
Don't be misled by it, Li Mingcheng.

617
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,640
Even though I didn't

618
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,240
contact all of you these two years,

619
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,439
I know

620
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,240
Feifei is in the show biz now.

621
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,959
She's gaining popularity.

622
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,480
Qiujing continued her research
at the university.

623
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,240
She will be a professor in two years.

624
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,959
And you are thriving
in the investment area.

625
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,159
I also know

626
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,079
your parents want a grandchild badly.

627
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,720
They've been asking you
to bring them one and you also...

628
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,000
Well...

629
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,919
Where did you get this from?

630
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,799
Do not underestimate

631
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,199
the elderly's intel network.

632
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:42,240
Aren't Feifei's parents
busy being matchmakers?

633
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,199
- They added my parents into the group.
- Enough!

634
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,240
That didn't take long.

635
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,640
Where did this
mean and evil Zhou Shi come from?

636
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,240
Give me back
my sweet and innocent Zhou Shi.

637
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,760
You don't trust me?

638
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,400
Test me then.

639
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,959
It's been two years.

640
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,159
Your waist and your face become smaller.

641
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,319
Everything looks prettier now.

642
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,159
Are you trying to take my job now?

643
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,319
Wait.

644
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,159
She might be possessed.

645
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,520
Answer my questions.

646
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,240
How many sugar cubes do I put
in my coffee?

647
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Do I prefer salty or sweet tofu pudding?

648
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,679
Do I like egg white or egg yolk?

649
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,039
Do I usually get the condiments
or the sauce for the hot pot?

650
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:19,640
How many meals do I have a day?
How many bowls of rice per meal?

651
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,520
You have ten seconds
to answer my questions.

652
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I'll cook

653
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,199
whatever you want to eat.

654
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,720
You're Zhou Shi!

655
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,360
Zhou Shi is back.

656
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,279
That's all?

657
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,319
A foodie needs no logic.

658
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,679
My boss doesn't sound too happy
in the group chat.

659
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,439
I have to go now.

660
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,559
No, you finally came back.

661
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,120
We won't let you leave.

662
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,799
Will you stay this time?

663
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,439
Yes.

664
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,959
See? We still have other opportunities.

665
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,199
All right.

666
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:00,520
If you disappear again,

667
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,520
I will unfriend you!

668
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,439
Unfriend!

669
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,880
Thank you for the birthday presents.

670
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,959
I'll go now then.

671
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:13,079
Go.

672
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:15,960
See you.

673
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,880
Take care.

674
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:23,319
Zhou Shi.

675
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,479
Did you

676
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,239
run into Ning Fei when you were abroad?

677
