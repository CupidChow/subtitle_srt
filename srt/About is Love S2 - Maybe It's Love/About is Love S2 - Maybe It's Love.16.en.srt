Your food delivery.

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,440
I didn't order any food.

20
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,270
Yes, you did.

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,520
What's the rush?

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,030
Are you that thirsty?

23
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,190
You have no idea.

24
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,830
I was walking on eggshells
the whole way,

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,160
afraid I'd get found out.

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,440
I kept the helmet on
and didn't dare take a sip of water.

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,110
I think you're just addicted to acting.

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,670
I doubt there are
that many eyes focused on us.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,630
Better safe than sorry, you know?

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,000
Anyway, why did you ask me to come?

31
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,960
I...

32
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,000
You haven't eaten?

33
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,240
Are you hungry?

34
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,910
Where's the caretaker?

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,630
She's taken the day off.

36
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,470
What would you like to eat?
I'll order food.

37
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,670
No need to order.
The fridge is full of ingredients.

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,600
I'll take care of it.

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,960
I've washed it.

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,190
Leave it there.

41
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,190
What's wrong?

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,600
It got into my eyes.

43
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,190
Why did you rub your eyes

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,360
when you just washed chilies?

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,910
Let me see.

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,030
Does it hurt?

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,550
Blow it for me. It's painful.

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,550
You didn't get sand in your eye.

49
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,750
Why should I blow it?

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,880
Go and rinse it with water.

51
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,600
It really hurts. Just try it.

52
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,190
Alright.

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,830
You win.

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,390
So clumsy.

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,670
Which eye?

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Right eye.

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,670
Okay, stay still.

58
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,360
Naughty hands.

59
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,960
Do you still want to eat or not?

60
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,720
Leave. Stay away.

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,880
I want to look at you.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,040
Then just look.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,320
What's wrong with you?

64
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,200
I thought it caught on fire.

65
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,510
You're setting the fire. Get out!

66
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,510
Do you want to change your clothes?

67
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,600
Leave!

68
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,880
Well? Is it good?

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,000
It's good and delicious.

70
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,000
If only I could eat it every day.

71
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
You wish.

72
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,390
Now tell me. Did you ask me here

73
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,270
because you have new info
on the contract?

74
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,040
Li Mingcheng found out who's behind it.

75
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,830
The guy worked at Snow Group before.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,160
So it is Snow Group?

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,550
Is the guy under Xue Zi or Xue Le?

78
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,200
We're not sure about that yet.

79
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,230
But the person

80
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,070
worked at Snow three years ago.

81
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
So there's a higher possibility
that it is Xue Zi.

82
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,510
Xue Zi was the one
who sent me to Shangjue

83
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,790
to help organize the biennial.

84
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,350
Now that the biennial is over,

85
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,760
I'll be returning to my post.

86
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,880
It's my chance

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,270
to find out if Xue Zi is behind it.

88
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,550
If you're going back,

89
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,160
make sure you stay alert.

90
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,320
Call me

91
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,070
at the first sign of danger, okay?

92
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,040
And you say I'm being suspicious?

93
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,600
You're suspicious too.

94
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm just worried about you.

95
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,070
Alright. I'll be careful.

96
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,830
Why is it suddenly raining?

97
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,760
If it continues,

98
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,230
you'll have to send me back.

99
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,390
It sounds like a thunderstorm.

100
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
Why don't you...

101
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,320
Why don't you stay here for the night?

102
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,550
Your clothes will have time to dry too.

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,440
But I...

104
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,230
I promise I won't do anything.

105
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,040
I just want you
to stay a while longer with me.

106
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,230
Okay.

107
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,550
Eat the vegetable.

108
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm over it.

109
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,600
Your breakup with him is like a joke.

110
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,440
Yesterday, you wanted
to cut ties with him.

111
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,350
Today, you're sharing the same pillow.

112
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,040
That's not true.
I'm sleeping in the guest room.

113
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,320
So what if it's the guest room?

114
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,320
The point is who you're sleeping with.

115
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
What are you talking about?

116
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,070
I'm sleeping by myself.

117
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,350
Wei Qing asked you to stay at his place
at this hour.

118
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,200
Do you really think

119
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,350
he's not hoping for something from you?

120
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,270
That's because it's raining today.

121
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,040
He worried about my safety,
so he asked me to stay.

122
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,550
Worried about your safety?

123
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,110
He could've driven you home.

124
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,790
He has so many cars.

125
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,670
Wei An can also send you home.

126
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,000
Moreover,

127
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,200
you two deny
that you're not back together.

128
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,040
But you're totally acting like a couple.

129
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,320
Both the guy and girl are single.

130
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,070
Plus, you two had a past.

131
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,320
It's normal to want something more.

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,950
We're all grown-ups here.

133
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,790
As long as you feel love,

134
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,720
it's fine to go with the flow, no?

135
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,720
But...

136
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,480
Can I come in?

137
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,880
What did I just say?

138
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,070
I won't interrupt you two.

139
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,640
Good night.

140
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
Hey.

141
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:58,505
Hello?

142
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,510
Can I come in?

143
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,670
Yes.

144
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,670
Who were you talking to?

145
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,790
Feifei.

146
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,920
Why?

147
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,350
I found a movie. Let's watch together.

148
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,040
Okay.

149
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,440
We're drinking wine too?

150
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,950
Why? Are you scared?

151
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,790
Who said I'm scared?

152
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,640
You can't beat me anyway.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,070
That's true.

154
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,320
Knowing how you behave
when you're drunk,

155
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,030
I should be the one who's worried.

156
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,350
You...

157
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,960
It's a little cold tonight
with the rain.

158
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,440
Cover yourself.

159
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,640
Don't get chilled.

160
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
(I mustn't drink too much.)

161
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,230
(Nothing good ever happens
when I drink too much.)

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
(Feifei was overthinking it.)

163
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,790
(He has no other ideas.)

164
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,670
Why aren't you eating anything?

165
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,200
I don't feel like it.

166
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
Are you cold?

167
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,640
I'm fine.

168
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,150
You're obviously cold.
No need to pretend.

169
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,320
Come here.

170
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,320
Come here.

171
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,670
I'm still cold.

172
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,080
Still feeling cold?

173
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,590
Do you have a fever?

174
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,200
Let me feel your forehead.

175
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,440
You don't have a fever.

176
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,710
How about I get you an extra blanket?

177
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,030
I don't want a blanket.

178
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,640
Just let me hold you
and I won't be cold.

179
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,320
I told you not to try anything funny.

180
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,150
That hurts.

181
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,470
Alright, stop whining.

182
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,350
You're exaggerating.

183
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,790
It really hurts.

184
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,710
Blow it for me.

185
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,030
I won't.

186
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,960
Blow it.

187
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,960
No, I won't.

188
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,760
Blow it.

189
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,100
- (Do you trust me?)
- (I trust you.)

190
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,470
This will be Snow's office

191
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,710
in mainland China from now on.

192
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,080
Not bad, right?

193
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,710
Not bad.

194
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,000
You did a good job

195
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,440
with Wu Zheng.

196
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,910
Later,

197
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,760
I'll make sure you're rewarded.

198
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,000
There's no need.

199
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,230
Actually, I came to apologize to you.

200
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,230
Apologize for what?

201
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,000
Master Wu decided
not to press the matter,

202
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,670
but he also rejected the partnership.

203
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,440
For the Asian Art Biennial,

204
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,590
losing the most important artist

205
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,590
has hugely compromised the earnings.

206
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,400
For that, I have
an inescapable responsibility.

207
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,670
I'm willing to accept
the company's punishment.

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,350
We'll talk about the punishment later.

209
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,710
Go home and get ready.

210
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,470
I want you to go to
the group's party with me tonight.

211
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,590
Party?

212
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,080
But be careful.

213
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,080
The guy you despise will be there too.

214
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,230
Despise?

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,670
Miss Brainiac, thanks for taking me in.

216
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,280
I promise I'll only stay one night

217
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,350
and I'll leave tomorrow.

218
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,150
Sure.

219
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,520
If you don't like that Xue Le,

220
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,320
then why don't you just say no to him?

221
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,520
Seriously?

222
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,320
He's the investor for my TV series.

223
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,550
I can annoy anyone but him.

224
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,960
But I really don't want
to go to the party

225
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
he wishes to take me to.

226
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,230
Hence, I'm hiding at your place.

227
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,960
Alright.

228
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,150
I'll get you some soup.

229
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,550
Where's your husband?

230
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,350
Feifei, hey.

231
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,840
Darling.

232
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,110
Great timing. The food is ready.

233
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,200
I made some new dishes today.

234
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,320
Darling.

235
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,030
Listen, I'm not that hungry.

236
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,840
Can we eat later?

237
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,350
I need the toilet.

238
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,470
Is he sick?

239
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,640
Wait a moment. I'll be right back.

240
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,550
Dig in.

241
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,440
Wait.

242
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,710
Why do these foods look weird?

243
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,880
Are they nice?

244
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,080
I think

245
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,030
"nice" isn't the right word to use.

246
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,640
It's good on the inside.

247
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Actually, I'm not hungry.

248
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,910
Plus, I'm on a diet.

249
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,520
Then this is perfect for you.

250
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,790
This is pumpkin with carp.

251
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,200
This is mung bean soup.

252
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,520
Very low carbs.

253
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,590
See, I have a photoshoot tomorrow.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
I don't want to be bloated
like a barrel.

255
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,000
That won't look good.

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,520
These foods might make me bloat.

257
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,400
You have a pimple here.

258
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,590
It means you have a lot of heat.

259
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,230
The mung bean soup
is the perfect remedy.

260
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,880
Helps to cool inner heat.

261
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:48,375
(Xue Le)

262
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,840
It's Mr. Xue.

263
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,910
Hold on.

264
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,640
Mr. Xue.

265
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,910
What? You're at my house?

266
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,880
Yes.

267
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,320
I know you didn't agree

268
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,640
to go with me to the party,

269
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,200
but I'm not ready to give up yet.

270
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,280
So,

271
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,880
will you show me some courtesy?

272
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,230
The party?

273
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,910
I'll go.

274
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,030
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

275
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,150
Okay. I'll send you the address.

276
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,640
Let's meet there directly.

277
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,000
My dear Miss Brainiac.

278
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,790
I've decided
to attend the party after all.

279
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,150
Bye.

280
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,030
Feifei's left?

281
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,150
Great. Let's eat.

282
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm not hungry, Darling.

283
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,280
Just try.

284
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,910
Darling.

285
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,150
Darling.

286
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,320
Try it.

287
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,150
Darling.

288
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,520
I told you, right?

289
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,230
You don't have
to change anything else for me.

290
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,230
It's fine to be the real you.

291
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,790
I am being

292
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,200
the real me right now.

293
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,710
So why are you cooking for me?

294
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,400
Cooking has become my latest hobby.

295
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,030
And I think

296
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm quite talented.

297
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,470
Try it.

298
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,760
Why does it taste so good?

299
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,840
Try this one.

300
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,960
Darling, you're amazing!

301
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,590
Because I found the balance
of all things.

302
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,425
(Snow Group)

303
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,230
Zhou Shi.

304
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,190
Feifei.

305
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,760
What are you doing here?

306
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,400
I'm here to attend the party.

307
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,920
Why are you here?

308
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,470
I came with Xue Zi.

309
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,830
Xue Zi? Why is she here?

310
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,430
This is Snow's private banquet.

311
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,350
Snow just established its branch
in the mainland.

312
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,760
This is the celebratory party.

313
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,760
Snow's private banquet?

314
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,710
That's right.

315
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,280
Wait.

316
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,230
Who did you come with?

317
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,070
Don't tell me it's Xue Ning.

318
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,590
Of course not. I came with Xue Le.

319
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,560
Is he also with Snow?

320
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,430
Not only is he with Snow,

321
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,800
but he's also Xue Zi's younger brother.

322
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,470
One of Snow's heirs.

323
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,680
What?

324
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,640
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

325
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,680
You never told me you two are close.

326
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,520
I...

327
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,520
Let's chat over there.

328
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,230
Okay.

329
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,190
Let's go.

330
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,310
Wait here. I'm going to talk to him.

331
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,830
Feifei.

332
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,880
Make sure we learn

333
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,110
from Mr. Xue well today.

334
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,520
Definitely.

335
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,760
Where is she?

336
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:14,700
(Wei Qing: Look up)

337
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,000
Why are you here?

338
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,800
Isn't this Snow's private banquet?

339
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,350
Snow has entered China's market.

340
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,760
As its biggest rival, Yunma,

341
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,040
they had to invite me

342
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,190
to show off a little.

343
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,640
So you just agreed?

344
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,190
It's because you're here.

345
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,520
How can I say no?

346
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,310
You're becoming

347
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,830
more of a smooth talker, Mr. Wei.

348
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,280
That's expected.

349
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,230
Anyway, back to business.

350
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,070
All of Snow's top brass are here.

351
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,230
Have you found anything?

352
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,040
Nothing new just yet.

353
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,680
But I think Xue Zi

354
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,280
has started to be wary of me.

355
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,520
Is she suspecting us now?

356
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,560
She isn't suspecting us.

357
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,640
More like she's never trusted us.

358
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,710
- Hello, Ms. Xue.
- Ms. Xue.

359
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,710
I thought you didn't like
these occasions.

360
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,310
So what brings you here today?

361
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,400
I'm here for someone.

362
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,760
Where's Lin Feifei?

363
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Lin Feifei?

364
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,470
Is she here too?

365
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,040
Where is Xue Le?

366
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,280
Probably in the main hall.

367
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,920
- To a good partnership.
- To a good partnership.

368
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,230
You were gone for so long.

369
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,470
- Mr. Xue.
- I...

370
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,040
Shouldn't you introduce us? Who's this?

371
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,160
Seeing how anxious Mr. Xue is,

372
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,040
she must be his girlfriend.

373
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,110
It's my first time
meeting Mr. Xue's girlfriend.

374
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,560
She looks familiar.
I think I've seen her before.

375
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,400
Feifei is an actress.

376
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,110
A celebrity?

377
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,310
No wonder she's gorgeous.

378
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,830
You two make a great pair.

379
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,680
You've misunderstood.
I'm not his girlfriend.

380
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,110
Mr. Xue.

381
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,800
I have something to ask you.

382
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,520
I'll be right back.

383
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,800
Go coax her.

384
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,520
Why didn't you tell me

385
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,710
you're with Snow?

386
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,110
Why did you suddenly ask this?

387
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,190
Does it matter if I'm with Snow or not?

388
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,310
Yes, it does.

389
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,520
Don't you know how much I hate Xue Zi?

390
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,560
Why?

391
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,110
A personal grudge.

392
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,520
I'm sorry. I can't stay any longer.

393
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,400
I don't want to be
in the same space as her.

394
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,920
Wait.

395
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,350
I have something to discuss with Xue Zi.

396
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Once I'm done, I'll leave with you.

397
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,830
Let go of your hand.

398
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,000
Mr. Xue.

399
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,880
You two are really fighting?

400
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,400
Then you're in the wrong.

401
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,430
Did you make the lady upset?

402
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,110
A young couple has no reason to fight.
Come on.

403
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,560
That's right. You can throw a tantrum
when you're behind closed doors.

404
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,560
When in public, you should get along.

405
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,800
- Yes.
- Remember where you are.

406
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,710
It's not good to disrespect Mr. Xue.

407
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,110
Don't make a scene, you know?

408
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,040
That's right.

409
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,350
Are you guys done?

410
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,110
Sorry about that. She's being emotional.

411
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,040
I...

412
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,160
Let her go.

413
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,830
I'm warning you.

414
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,190
Stop pestering her.

415
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,190
Personally,

416
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,880
Miss Lin and I are friends.

417
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,070
Professionally,

418
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,950
I'm her TV series' investor.

419
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,520
How is that pestering?

420
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,920
Then let me tell you now.

421
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,160
From now on,

422
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,640
she is no longer your friend.

423
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,110
Who are you to speak for Miss Lin?

424
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
I'm her boyfriend.

425
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,520
Let's go.

426
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,310
Miss Lin really knows her ways.

427
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,000
She always has two men
wrapped around her finger

428
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,280
at any one time.

429
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,040
I...

430
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,800
From now on,

431
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,190
I'm the only one
wrapped around her finger.

432
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's go.

433
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,520
I thought you were only bad
at doing business.

434
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,280
Looks like you're terrible at love too.

435
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,160
Do you have to be so blunt?

436
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,230
There are too many people here.

437
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,760
Let's talk upstairs.

438
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,040
That's enough. Let go.

439
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,520
I told you. Stay away from Xue Le.

440
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,110
Why won't you listen?

441
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,560
Why did you come to the party?

442
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,160
Where I go and what I do

443
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,350
is my own freedom.

444
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,880
It has nothing to do with you.

445
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,430
Yes, it does.

446
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,310
I'm your boyfriend.

447
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,470
I said enough.

448
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,430
I let it go because
you helped me back there.

449
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,520
If you continue blabbering,

450
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,800
I'm going to hit you.

451
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,160
Did I say anything wrong?

452
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,640
Isn't Ning Fei your boyfriend?

453
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,190
Ning Fei is my...

454
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,430
What do you remember?

455
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,000
Did you regain your memory?

456
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,710
Then why did you say that?

457
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,470
You're not Ning Fei.

458
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,800
At least, you're not completely him.

459
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,830
It's just some memories.

460
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,830
What we're experiencing now

461
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,830
will also become
a part of the memory, no?

462
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,520
It's not the same.

463
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,040
When I was at my worst,

464
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,110
when I was lost,

465
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,916
it was Fei who stayed by my side.

466
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,070
What we went through

467
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,560
is part of our relationship.

468
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,590
If you can't even remember that,

469
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,590
how can you call yourself my boyfriend?

470
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,560
What if I did remember?

471
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,070
What do you mean?

472
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,830
What do you remember?

473
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,040
Why are you standing there?
Let's go home.

474
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,070
Don't overthink.

475
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,280
My heels are killing me, that's all.

476
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Be my crutch.

477
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,920
Don't be so nervous.

478
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,950
I picked this spot.

479
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,430
It has sight of anyone approaching.

480
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,800
I have to go now.

481
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,350
If Xue Zi looks for me

482
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,400
and I'm not there,
she'll become suspicious.

483
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,400
Can't you stay with me a while longer?

484
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,800
Feifei is here too.

485
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,040
I'm worried about her.

486
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,430
First it's Xue Zi, then it's Feifei.

487
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,950
When will you worry about me?

488
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,520
Let me go!

489
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,430
I told you there's no going back for us.

490
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,430
Stop pestering me!

491
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,470
What are you...

492
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,190
Zhou Shi, what is it that you want?

493
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,880
I can do whatever you want.

494
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,710
Okay.

495
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,230
Then stop pestering me again.

496
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,190
Let go!

497
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,950
Mr. Wei, you're roughing up a lady.

498
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,230
That's not proper.

499
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,920
Ms. Xue.

500
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,400
Mr. Xue.

501
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,280
Mr. Wei.

502
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,160
Zhou Shi is one of Snow's staff now.

503
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,920
And this party is organized by Snow.

504
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,400
Although you're an invited guest,

505
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,560
if you continue to harass Zhou Shi,

506
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm afraid
I'll have to ask you to leave.

507
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,640
No need for you to ask me.

508
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,230
I'll leave on my own.

509
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,110
Also, congrats

510
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,000
on Snow's venture
into the mainland market.

511
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,950
I'm looking forward
to working together in the future.

512
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,800
Thanks for saving me, Ms. Xue.

513
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,680
I thought you two
were just having a lovers' quarrel.

514
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,400
Are you really going to break up?

515
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,880
Love just doesn't work
when the timing is not right.

516
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,920
Right now, I just want to focus on work.

517
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,760
I have no interest in other matters.

518
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,070
There's a gift box in the car boot.

519
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,590
Help me retrieve it.

520
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,950
I prepared it as a gift for Mr. Zhang.

521
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,640
Will do.

522
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,350
Excuse me, can you help me

523
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,350
retrieve a gift box
from Ms. Xue's car boot?

524
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,230
Okay.

525
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,470
Bring it to me.

526
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,760
Thanks.

527
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,400
You wanted to talk to me in private.

528
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,830
So what is it?

529
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,310
I heard Yunma paid you

530
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,800
a large compensation for the biennial.

531
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,950
They upset Mr. Wu.

532
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,190
The biennial suffered a loss.

533
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,800
It's only right to offer compensation.

534
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,280
Yes, they should.

535
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,230
But knowing how shrewd Wei Qing is,

536
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,190
I doubt he made the contract.

537
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,110
Maybe he had a lapse of judgment.

538
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,000
He might have misjudged.

539
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,000
But for someone known as
the Gentlemen Killer

540
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,830
to make a dumb mistake like that?

541
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,710
I don't buy it.

542
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,520
Then it must be one of his staff.

543
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,190
Wasn't Li Mingcheng laid off?

544
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,680
Do you know Wang Kang?

545
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,520
No.

546
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,760
Don't think

547
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,310
you're the only one with intel.

548
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,800
Sounds like

549
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,710
you're wanting to punish me.

550
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,800
Everything I did
was for Shangjue's good.

551
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,160
You're still young.

552
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,280
As your older sister,
I wish to remind you.

553
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,470
It's normal to employ tactics
while doing business.

554
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,400
But be mindful of the backlash.

555
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,590
You're no match for Wei Qing.

556
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,950
Thank you for the reminder.

557
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,160
Here's the gift box.

558
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,950
Ms. Xue, the gift box.

559
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,760
Thank you.

560
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,920
I've said what I wanted.

561
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,520
You may go.

562
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,280
All the best.

563
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,710
Ms. Xue, if there's nothing else,

564
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,230
I'm going to leave too.

565
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,830
Wait.

566
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,470
Come inside.

567
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,800
(Did she notice I was eavesdropping?)

568
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,190
Zhou Shi.

569
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,400
Coming.

570
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,710
You seem nervous.

571
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,800
You suddenly asked me to stay.

572
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,680
I can't help but feel nervous.

573
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,640
Tomorrow, I'll transfer you
to Shangjue temporarily.

574
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,110
My little brother is worrying me.

575
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,590
Keep an eye on him for me.

576
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,640
But wouldn't Mr. Xue think

577
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,950
you sent me there to...

578
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,110
To supervise him?

579
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,350
That's a given.

580
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,160
Shangjue is a subsidiary of Snow.

581
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,000
It's only normal for me to send someone

582
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,470
to supervise him.

583
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,000
Don't worry.
He can't do anything to you.

584
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,880
Okay. I'll be going now.

585
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,710
Here's the whelk.

586
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,880
So, Xue Le has to be behind

587
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,830
this whole fiasco.

588
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,430
But what is his reason for doing it?

589
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,760
Wu Zheng is a notable figure
in the art industry.

590
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,350
If he's decided

591
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,470
not to work with Yunma,

592
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,280
many other artists

593
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,710
would probably make the same choice.

594
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,230
Think about it.

595
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Where would they go then?

596
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,000
Snow.

597
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,520
So his real motive

598
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,710
is to taint Yunma's reputation

599
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,280
through this incident.

600
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,640
That's despicable.

601
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,520
Now Xue Zi sent you
to keep an eye on him.

602
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,110
Looks like she's deemed him

603
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,070
as a rival.

604
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,430
But I think

605
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,190
she trusts me more now.

606
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,880
I've been thinking.

607
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,190
How come Wang Kang

608
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,920
has so much power?

609
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,800
What if there's more than one mole?

610
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,400
Why aren't you eating?

611
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,830
Are you waiting for me
to pick them out for you?

612
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,950
It's dirty.

613
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,350
Now you're clueless.

614
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,800
A roadside stall only looks dirty.

615
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,800
What matters is the taste.

616
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,590
Come on, let me deshell it for you.

617
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,800
Taste it.

618
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,830
No thanks.

619
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,950
Just a small bite.

620
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,470
It's really good.

621
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,830
Well? Isn't it nice?

622
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,350
(Yunma Group)

623
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,070
Mr. Wei is here.

624
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,710
Mr. Wei, you announced
your marriage plan

625
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,470
in such a high-profile manner.
So is it for real?

626
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,560
Members of the media

627
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,070
have always been intrigued

628
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,230
with my love life.

629
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,160
Rather than let
your assumptions go wild,

630
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,920
I might as well announce it myself.

631
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,110
Yes, I'm planning to get married.

632
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,160
And I'm going to propose to her today.

633
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,230
So your ex-girlfriend...

634
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,190
Watch your words.

635
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,070
We never officially broke up.

636
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,310
So she is still my girlfriend.

637
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,000
At the same time,
I admire her professional capability.

638
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,710
I've decided to let her
join Yunma as a shareholder.

639
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,040
(I'm planning to get married.)

640
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,430
(And I'm going to propose to her today.)

641
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,870
Congrats, Ms. Zhou.

642
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,320
Congrats for what?

643
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,760
Congrats because you're about

644
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,190
to become Yunma's lady boss.

645
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,710
What are you talking about?

646
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,320
Haven't you seen today's news?

647
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,600
I was driving.

648
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,000
Take a look, Ms. Zhou.

649
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,080
(I'm planning to get married.)

650
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,430
(And I'm going to propose to her today.)

651
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,390
When was this?

652
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,710
Today.

653
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
He's already on his way to Shangjue.

654
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,840
What?

655
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,630
Ms. Zhou.

656
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
How did you manage to nab Wei Qing?

657
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,150
Can you teach us?

658
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Please teach us.

659
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,000
No need to work, huh?

660
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,360
Zhou Shi, come to my office.

661
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,360
(At the same time,
I admire her professional capability.)

662
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,670
(I've decided to let her
join Yunma as a shareholder.)

663
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,870
Wei Qing really made a fuss.

664
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,670
He's obviously using the press

665
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,560
to exert pressure on you.

666
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,710
He's always been over-the-top.

667
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,080
He likes to make assertions.

668
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,670
That kind of personality is exactly why

669
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,950
I wanted to break up with him.

670
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,000
Don't you want

671
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,080
to join Yunma?

672
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,840
Must I go because he wants me to?

673
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,800
Besides, I'm still with Snow.

674
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,840
The things you're saying now

675
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,800
are totally in line
with my sister's point of view.

676
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,840
No wonder she sent you to help me.

677
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,120
You two really are the same kind.

678
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,950
You flatter me, Mr. Xue.

679
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,390
I can't even begin to compare.

680
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,360
Ms. Xue

681
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,000
is in charge of the whole Snow.

682
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,190
Meanwhile, I couldn't even do a good job
with the biennial.

683
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,320
I came to Shangjue just to assist you,

684
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
to help with communication.

685
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,710
If you need to take a temporary leave,

686
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,870
I'll get HR to sort it out for you.

687
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm good.

688
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,360
Don't worry, Mr. Xue.

689
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,560
I won't let my personal matter

690
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,080
affect my job.

691
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,280
Okay.

692
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,710
You may go back to work.

693
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,470
Congrats, Ms. Zhou.

694
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,710
Congrats, Ms. Zhou.

695
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,870
Get back to work.

696
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,630
(Yes, I'm planning to get married.)

697
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,840
(And I'm going to propose to her today.)

698
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,040
If I had known how pompous you are,

699
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,630
I wouldn't have agreed.

700
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,560
You want me to have a share in Yunma?

701
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,280
I don't want it.

702
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,710
You have to.

703
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,670
You'll be nominating yourself to Xue Zi.

704
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,840
We have to make her believe

705
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,520
how important you are to me.

706
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,000
Only then will she regard you
as a valuable pawn.

707
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,120
With that,

708
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,360
you'll have the chance

709
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,600
to dig deeper into her secrets.

710
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,520
The shares will be your bargaining chip.

711
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,910
Don't push.

712
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,910
What are you doing?

713
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,280
I promise you.

714
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,560
I'll make you happy.

715
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,630
Please marry me.

716
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,670
Stop filming!

717
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,870
It's a no!

718
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,430
What are you doing?

719
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,760
Stop filming!

720
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,520
Zhou Shi!

721
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,190
Can you tell us why you said no?

722
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,910
Ms. Zhou, why did you reject Mr. Wei?

723
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,950
- Ms. Zhou!
- Ms. Zhou, don't go!

724
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,360
Stop chasing.

725
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,120
She's probably
feeling confused right now.

726
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,800
Give her space to calm down.

727
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,630
I'm sure she'll come around soon.

728
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,390
I don't think
I asked any reporters to come.

729
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,320
Mr. Xue is here.

730
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,870
This is my company.

731
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,040
Why wouldn't I be here?

732
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,190
Anyhow, Mr. Wei.

733
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,630
What are you planning,

734
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,120
bringing all these people?

735
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,230
Don't worry. I'm just about to leave.

736
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,560
Is that so?

737
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,360
Mr. Wei, are you going
to propose to her again?

738
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,670
Please comment, Mr. Wei.

739
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,280
Get back to your work.

740
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:43,500
(Chairman Wei Qing of Yunma Group
announced he would propose to Zhou Shi)

741
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,360
Did you have to make such a fuss?

742
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,120
I don't want to be the talk of the town.

743
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,000
- Yes.
- Isn't she the one?

744
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,040
That's her, right?

745
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,040
Take a photo of her.

746
00:38:57,981 --> 00:38:59,600
(Xue Zi)

747
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,520
Ms. Xue.

748
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,360
Come and meet me at the usual place.

749
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,470
Okay.

750
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,390
What do you plan to do?

751
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,080
What can I do?

752
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,040
I'll have to be clear with him.

753
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,430
I can't take this anymore.

754
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,840
He's a grown person.

755
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,870
Why is he still so immature
when it comes to love?

756
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,080
I'm not going to let him have his way.

757
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,230
Become a shareholder? Marriage proposal?

758
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,230
It's a no from me.

759
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,430
I think

760
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,520
it's fine to reject
the marriage proposal.

761
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,910
But taking a share in Yunma
is necessary.

762
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,280
With shares,

763
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,950
you'll be able to do what you want.

764
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,230
That may be true.

765
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,470
But if I go to Yunma,

766
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,870
I'll be under his supervision.

767
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
I actually think

768
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,230
once you have a share,

769
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,560
you'll be one of Yunma's shareholders.

770
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,800
Are you saying

771
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,150
that I should go to Yunma?

772
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,800
But if I go to Yunma,

773
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,360
I'll be leaving Snow.

774
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,430
I still want to learn more from you.

775
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,560
That is why

776
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,280
I have a condition.

777
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,840
Once you get the shares,

778
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,040
I hope you'll transfer 10% to me.

779
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,080
I'll exchange them with Snow's shares.

780
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,040
We'll then become co-beneficiaries.

781
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,320
You can continue to be a part of Snow.

782
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,760
It will pave the way

783
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,190
for deeper relations
between Yunma and Snow.

784
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,190
You wish to work with Wei Qing?

785
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,470
I thought you hated him.

786
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,520
Snow is still building
its foundation in China.

787
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,120
Working with Yunma
is the smartest choice.

788
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,320
But I still have my reservations

789
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,430
if I have to work with Wei Qing.

790
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,630
But it will be different
with you in the middle.

791
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,630
Knowing my relationship with Wei Qing,

792
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,430
aren't you worried
that we would gang up

793
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,950
and go against you?

794
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,120
You're just like the old me.

795
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,910
You don't like losing.

796
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,600
You don't want to submit to the men.

797
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,390
In today's society,

798
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,840
it's not easy for a woman

799
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,040
to have a successful career.

800
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,040
I hope to have one more ally.

801
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,910
Thank you for trusting me.

802
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,080
(So Wei Qing guessed right.)

803
