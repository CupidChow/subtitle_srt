=Episode 5=

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
I heard that Fei was awake.

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,559
But he's not in good condition.

18
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,199
Okay. Now, I'm going to
ask you some questions.

19
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,400
If the answer is yes, move your finger.

20
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,719
If it's no, do nothing at all.

21
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,160
Can you do that?

22
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,999
Okay. Let's begin.

23
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,279
First of all,

24
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,400
are you having trouble sleeping?

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,240
Are you afraid
of empty spaces or streets?

26
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,639
What are they doing?

27
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,120
What's wrong with Fei?

28
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,400
Can't you tell?

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,719
They are doing a
comprehensive examination

30
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,880
on his mental state.

31
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,400
The more yeses he has,

32
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,040
the more mentally unstable he is.

33
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,479
Are you scared for no reason at all?

34
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,040
Do you think the people
around you are unfriendly to you?

35
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,240
Do you think most people

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,359
cannot be trusted?

37
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,520
Do you have any desire to harm anyone?

38
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,760
Now, let's ask the last question.

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,120
Do you have any memory
of your previous life?

40
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,439
PTSD?

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

42
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,839
It's a kind of mental health condition
that usually happened

43
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,199
when someone has experienced
the threat of death

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,520
or suffered serious injuries.

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,400
It usually comes with memory loss

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,199
and overreaction to the surroundings.

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,719
So, it means that Fei...

48
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,279
His condition

49
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,400
may be more serious than expected.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,479
Stop it! No!

51
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,839
-No!
-Stop it!

52
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,199
Somebody, get him off!

53
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,880
Fei, what are you doing? Let go of him.

54
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,999
Stop it.

55
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
Why should I listen to you?

56
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,559
Because she's your sister.

57
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,919
Let go! Do you want to go to jail?

58
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,960
Let go! Do you want to go to jail?

59
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,199
You are so noisy!

60
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,079
Let go!

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,320
You are so noisy!

62
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,719
Can't he even recognize

63
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,839
his family after he wakes up?

64
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,479
Can't you tell?

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,800
Have you really lost your memory?

66
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,560
As if!

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,079
Release me!

68
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,800
Don't be so fierce.

69
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,120
If you weren't that aggressive,

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,879
I wouldn't have to knock you out.

71
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,919
Is this how you treat a human?

72
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,079
Am I a dog?

73
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,560
Why are you tying me up?

74
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,359
Fine.

75
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,000
I can untie you.

76
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,560
But you have to answer me properly.

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,359
You really don't remember who you are?

78
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,639
Don't worry.

79
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,079
Me and your sister

80
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,840
won't abandon you.

81
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,039
I just want to know

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,759
if you were the one who saved me

83
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,960
in the alley that day.

84
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:49,240
(I was almost unconscious back then.)

85
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,400
(But I think I heard your voice.)

86
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
(You were fighting him.)

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
(When I woke up,
I was already in the hospital.)

88
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,560
(The nurse told me)

89
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,159
(that you were seriously wounded.)

90
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,919
This is my fault.

91
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,199
If it weren't for me,

92
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,680
you wouldn't have...

93
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,599
This is my fault.

94
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,479
If I didn't act brave back then,

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,199
if I didn't take the shortcut...

96
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,840
Can you stop talking?

97
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:18,639
I'm already like this now.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,599
What's the point of
knowing the reason behind it?

99
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,000
If I'm injured to this point

100
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,879
because I want to save a girl,

101
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,720
it means that I'm too weak.

102
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,240
It has nothing to do with you.

103
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,479
Moreover,

104
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,359
you were injured too, right?

105
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,520
Fei.

106
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,759
You don't remember your name yet, right?

107
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,400
You are...

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,440
Xue Ning.

109
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,599
It doesn't matter if you don't remember.

110
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,800
You just need to know
that you are part of the Snow Group

111
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,039
and the only younger brother
I acknowledge.

112
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
Come out with me for a while.

113
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,639
Xue Ning?

114
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,079
How to write it?

115
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
Release me before you go!

116
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,359
Why did you lie to him?

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,159
He has a name.

118
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,919
Is that important?

119
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,639
Whether his surname is Xue or not,
he's still my brother.

120
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,199
What about his past?

121
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,639
Are you not going to tell him?

122
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,120
Don't you think

123
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,800
that he has a right to choose?

124
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,479
What do you mean?

125
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,960
How are you so sure

126
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,359
that he wants to remember the past?

127
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,560
Anyway, your mission

128
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,520
is to stay by his side until he recovers.

129
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,599
As for the other things, don't worry about it.

130
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,319
You don't mind even if he can't turn back

131
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,240
into Xunran?

132
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,319
You'll be there, won't you?

133
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,400
He treats you as a sister too, right?

134
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,919
(Fei.)

135
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,039
(You have to recover soon.)

136
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,479
Zhou Shi.

137
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,240
You can't even sleep properly.

138
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Do not...

139
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,720
Do not go back to him.

140
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,520
If you go back to him, I'll...

141
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
What will you do?

142
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,479
I'll beat him up.

143
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,639
What did you say?

144
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,759
What are you doing?

145
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll complain to my sister about you.

146
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,719
Complain to your sister?

147
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:41,039
I am your sister.

148
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,159
Where's my phone?

149
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,440
Have you seen my phone?

150
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,599
No.

151
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,519
Mr. Wei.

152
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,240
Mr. Wei!

153
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,039
I'm doomed.

154
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,200
Why are you taking my phone?

155
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,159
Shut up.

156
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,760
Finally, you called.

157
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,159
Looks like my phone is indeed with you.

158
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,159
Sorry for bothering you

159
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,479
so late at night.

160
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,640
But my phone is my working tool.

161
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,760
Can you give it back to me?

162
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,080
Sure, I can.

163
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,959
But you have to answer my question first.

164
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,279
Why did you approach me?

165
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,479
(This is strange.)

166
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,200
(Wei An should have known)

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,760
(that this phone is mine.)

168
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,200
(Didn't he inform him about it?)

169
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,240
(Luckily, he can't tell that it's me)

170
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
(because my voice is hoarse now.)

171
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,680
If I tell you

172
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,680
that I'm just a passer-by,
will you believe me?

173
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,719
No.

174
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,519
What if I say I'm your fan?

175
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,560
I'll believe you then.

176
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,519
He's so confident.

177
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,440
You left

178
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,599
your working tool behind
right after our first meet.

179
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,320
And you only call me
after so much time has passed.

180
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,359
Other than a fan of mine,

181
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,440
I don't know who else
will be so affected by me.

182
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,640
Just think of me as a fan then.

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,959
Well.

184
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,640
Can you give me back
my phone then, my idol?

185
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,159
Depends on my mood.

186
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,000
You still can't find Wei Qing?

187
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,359
I've looked for him everywhere.

188
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,440
His eyes are not good.

189
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,000
But he's good at hiding.

190
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
I don't understand him.

191
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:16,599
He's a CEO. But he's afraid of needles!

192
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,479
So, you are hiding from someone.

193
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,800
No wonder you talk so softly.

194
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,599
Do you want me to shout

195
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:24,959
for the nurse for you?

196
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,880
Are you joking?
I won't be threatened by you.

197
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,560
You can't be sure.

198
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,959
You can't see.

199
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,039
Maybe you can't even find
the hang-up button.

200
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,120
My idol, what do you think?

201
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,159
Do you feel better now?

202
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,919
Yes. I'll give it back to you.

203
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,039
I'll return it to you.

204
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,000
Come to the hospital tomorrow morning.

205
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,120
You want to personally
give it back to me?

206
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,000
You need to be able to find me first.

207
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,919
One more thing.

208
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,919
I don't need to hang up.

209
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,800
I just need to turn off the phone.

210
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,479
Why can't he deliver it to me
through a courier?

211
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,640
What should I tell him

212
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,719
tomorrow?

213
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,159
How about we look for him over there?

214
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,919
Okay. Continue to look for him.

215
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,000
-He's here.
-Mr. Wei.

216
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,760
-Finally, you came out.
-Finally, we found him.

217
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,959
-Be careful.
-Slow down.

218
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,039
This is strange.

219
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,120
Now is the peak time
for the crew to go out.

220
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,680
But why isn't there anyone?

221
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:24,880
Isn't that great?

222
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,320
Now, you don't have
to come up with an excuse.

223
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,159
How can I not think about it?

224
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,440
It'll be so easy

225
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,519
to replace me and fire me.

226
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:35,519
Yes. Open.

227
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
What do you mean by yes? I'm not fired yet.

228
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,479
I mean, open the door.

229
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,919
Let's make a bet.

230
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:49,680
What bet?

231
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:53,479
If you can pass without a hiccup this time,

232
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,200
treat me to a meal.

233
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,919
What has it got to do with you?

234
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,959
Do you really think you are that great?

235
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,080
Director.

236
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:15,640
Feifei.

237
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,279
Come here. Why are you careless?

238
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,200
Let me take a look.

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,800
You are so seriously wounded.

240
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,000
Looks like we can't continue
with the filming.

241
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:24,839
No, Director.

242
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,959
My injury is not serious at all.

243
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,399
We can continue
after I put on some foundation on it.

244
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,640
-Well...
-Director, don't.

245
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:29,560
The movie industry is in a slump now.

246
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,919
It wasn't easy for me to get this role.

247
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
I'm the first to reach every day.

248
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,719
It's not easy for me.

249
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,800
Please don't replace me. I beg you.

250
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,839
What nonsense are you talking about?

251
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,320
Here. Come here.

252
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,640
Be careful.

253
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,620
(Outpatient Department)

254
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,680
This is from Wei Qing?

255
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
I thought it would be hard to get it back.

256
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,000
Where is he now?

257
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,479
He's in hiding again?

258
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,080
You are his friend, right?

259
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,479
Can you please advise him for us?

260
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:19,560
(Optic neuritis is not
an intractable illness.)

261
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,279
(But we need the patient to cooperate.)

262
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,320
(Mr. Wei is so against
the idea of getting treatment.)

263
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,320
(It can easily cause him to miss
the golden time for his treatment.)

264
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,000
(There might even be
a sequela because of that.)

265
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,279
Ms. Xue.

266
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,760
Why did you turn off your phone?

267
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,479
I tried to reach you the whole night.

268
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,640
I lost my phone. I just found it.

269
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Is there an emergency?

270
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,560
I heard that Wei Qing
was in an accident.

271
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,919
Have you heard anything about it?

272
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,919
Me?

273
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:03,320
No.

274
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,800
I just recovered from my fever.

275
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,599
I'm still coughing now.

276
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,399
I don't have time to go to Yunma.

277
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,000
I won't force you

278
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,719
if you don't want to go there.

279
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,440
But you'll have to handle
the Art Biennial for me.

280
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,959
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

281
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,359
Zhou Shi.

282
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,680
Although I always focus on the results,

283
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,000
sometimes,

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
the process is more important
than the results.

285
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,159
Two years are neither long nor short.

286
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:35,760
You need to change.

287
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,760
Let bygones be bygones.

288
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:39,680
Think carefully.

289
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,440
Where does your future lie?

290
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
I know where I want to be.

291
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,200
(Yes. I know very well.)

292
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,719
(If we stay in contact,)

293
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,479
(we'll only bring trouble to each other.)

294
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,680
(Since I had chosen to leave him,)

295
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,200
(I shouldn't be involved in his life anymore.)

296
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,959
(What if I'm just a passer-by?)

297
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,000
(If he doesn't know me,)

298
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,719
(does it mean)

299
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,760
(that I can comfort him
without any worries?)

300
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,560
Mr. Wei, you really know how
to choose the best place.

301
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,440
Aren't you afraid of the glaring sun?

302
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,440
It's you. I've already
returned your phone, right?

303
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,800
That's why I'm here.

304
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,760
I have to say thank you.

305
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,279
I can't just leave, right?

306
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,599
It's okay. Too many people owe me a favor.

307
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,039
I don't need gratitude
from a girl with a hoarse.

308
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,039
I...

309
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,640
My voice is hoarse now
because I have a fever.

310
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,240
I know it now.

311
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,880
You are trying to push me away
by making me mad.

312
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,320
Just like what you did to those nurses.

313
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,560
Do you want your eyes to recover or not?

314
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,279
It's none of your business.

315
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,560
Why are you walking so fast
despite not being able to see?

316
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,279
I know this path better than you.

317
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,240
This is the hospital.
There's no need to act tough.

318
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,680
Don't get sick then.

319
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:16,479
You...

320
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,240
What?

321
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,240
I went to get my shot
even though it was just a fever.

322
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,359
Getting an infusion is nothing.

323
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,640
Shut up. I'm not doing it.

324
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,080
There's a...

325
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,519
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,919
I didn't pull you back in time.

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,120
You said that you didn't
need help, right?

328
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,839
Why are you holding me so tightly?

329
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,959
Are you my fan or not?

330
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Forget it.

331
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,200
I don't have such a timid idol like you.

332
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:13,919
How about this?

333
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,239
I'll chase away the cat for you.

334
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,840
In return, you'll go and get your shot.

335
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,639
Choose one. What do you think?

336
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,440
Do I really have to choose?

337
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,080
You won.

338
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,399
I choose A.

339
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,320
This is right.

340
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,680
If you run away again next time,

341
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,879
I'll put a heap of catnip

342
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:33,879
in front of your ward.

343
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,840
I promise you that all the cats
in the hospital will go to you.

344
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,560
You!

345
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,039
Let's go, my idol.

346
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,279
From now on, I'll be your walking aid.

347
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,720
You are welcome.

348
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,800
You...

349
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,720
What's wrong with me?

350
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,519
You are so free.

351
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,200
You don't have a boyfriend, right?

352
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,999
Rock, paper, scissors.

353
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,560
[Robot vs Human 3:0]
Rock, paper, scissors.

354
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,360
Rock, paper, scissors.

355
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,879
How is it? My son is amazing, right?

356
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,239
I admit defeat. But I won't call it a son.

357
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,279
Did you create this?

358
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,119
Yes.

359
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,639
A brand-new and upgraded
rock-paper-scissors robot.

360
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,879
It can capture our motion
through the camera

361
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,279
and react within a millisecond.

362
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,440
With it,

363
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,519
you won't win me in
a rock, paper, scissors game again.

364
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:38,919
Is that so?

365
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,360
Let's try again then.

366
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,159
Rock, paper, scissors.

367
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,440
Rock, paper, scissors.

368
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,800
I forgot to input the data of the left hand.

369
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,399
You are so cunning.

370
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,279
Can I get

371
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,759
my reward now?

372
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,320
What reward?

373
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,279
I'm stuck at a stage

374
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,960
in this game of life.

375
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:19,999
Can you help me with it?

376
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,279
How can I help you?

377
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,680
Attack of the chromosome?

378
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,800
My leg.

379
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,039
Well.

380
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:48,159
Did I come at the wrong time?

381
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,480
You are already here anyway.

382
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,279
Didn't you have a shoot today?

383
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,399
I got lucky today and
the crew gave me a break.

384
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,879
Tell me.

385
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,039
What happened to you

386
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,919
that you came back at this time

387
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,639
with an injured leg?

388
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,480
Well. I still have some work to do.

389
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:15,840
I'll go back first.

390
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,039
Have a good chat.

391
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,159
But don't let her stay up all night
to play the game.

392
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,320
Okay.

393
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,999
I'll get going now.

394
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,519
Except being your husband, Li Mingcheng

395
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,159
is perfect.

396
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,100
(Mist spray that leads to allergy)

397
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:37,200
What are you doing?

398
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,440
You ruined my night.

399
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,919
If you are going to say

400
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,919
anything pointless, I...

401
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,560
Wait!

402
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,720
I saw Ning Fei.

403
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,360
Can you do it?

404
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,639
It's just a photo.

405
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,919
I might not be able to do it in the past,

406
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:56,279
but now, with the search engine,

407
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:57,360
the nerve-like network,

408
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,600
the machine learning database,

409
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,080
the self-learning AI system and
the other technologies...

410
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,519
Make it simple. Use layman terms.

411
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,080
It means that as long as
he has shown his face before,

412
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,759
I'll be able to find him.

413
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,840
These photos are from one day ago.

414
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,279
Are you sure this is him?

415
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,600
You also think that it's unbelievable, right?

416
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,360
This man not acting like him.

417
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,080
Even if they look the same.

418
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,600
Can two years

419
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:22,080
change a person like this?

420
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,279
What steps do you need to take

421
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,440
to change someone with social anxiety

422
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,360
into a social butterfly in two years?

423
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,600
Go and ask him yourself.

424
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,279
I've asked my AI
to analyse his social activities.

425
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,080
He often visits these places.

426
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,519
You want me to wait for him to show up?

427
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,519
I'm not that free.

428
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,800
So many handsome men

429
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,239
want to eat with me every day.

430
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,420
(Ninghai Square,
188 Tianyuan Restaurant)

431
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,320
See?

432
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,200
Someone is asking me out again.

433
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,399
Why should I reject these easy men

434
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,399
to look for an idiot
who hid for two years?

435
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,039
Okay. I'll take it away if you don't want it.

436
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,080
Wait!

437
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
It's so painful.

438
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,080
Wei An.

439
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,919
Mr. Wei, what are you looking at?

440
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,239
Look.

441
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,840
Is there a bench over there?

442
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,200
That's right.

443
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,960
This is the right direction.

444
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,639
What's wrong?

445
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,720
Nothing.

446
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,320
I found a new friend today.

447
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,080
No.

448
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,919
My idol.

449
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,999
You won't die from a shot.

450
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Shut up. Of course I know.

451
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,039
You are not the one being injected.

452
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,720
It's easy for you to say.

453
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
Sure. I'll accompany you then.

454
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,879
I have to do an infusion anyway.

455
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,399
You don't have to do it.

456
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,680
I have to.

457
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,399
I know that you can't trust anyone

458
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,560
because you can't see now.

459
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,320
But don't be afraid.

460
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,480
I'll give you back the sense of security

461
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,119
that you've lost before this.

462
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,919
No. You...

463
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
It's done now.

464
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,320
You won't be in pain
after you eat the candy.

465
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,119
Look. It's just a small jab.

466
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,399
This is quite sweet.

467
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,759
Wei An, why are you also...

468
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:40,639
I'm sorry, Mr. Wei. I'm sorry.

469
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,639
It is

470
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,720
hard for me to imagine it.

471
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,399
But that lady

472
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,800
is quite resourceful.

473
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,519
She's indeed your fan.

474
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,399
What happened after that?

475
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:53,519
She said that she would
come back to visit me.

476
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,879
And she'll wait for me at that bench.

477
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,600
So, Wei An...

478
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,960
I'll keep an eye out for you.

479
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,639
But you should rest for today.

480
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:22,159
He's finally sleeping.

481
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,600
(iPad Is Locked)

482
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,900
(I've locked your video gaming device.
Go to sleep.)

483
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,600
Except being your husband, Li Mingcheng

484
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,080
is perfect.

485
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:59,639
Is there really such a thing
as a perfect husband?

486
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,560
Now, this is interesting.

487
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,360
What are you doing, my idol?

488
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:06,159
How can you scare your fan?

489
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,279
By the way, how do you know it's me?

490
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
You are here every time
I have an injection.

491
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,039
Who else if not you?

492
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:19,440
Are you doing origami?

493
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:22,560
You are the one who asked me

494
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
to find something else to do

495
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:26,399
to distract me from my boredom.

496
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,840
So, you really listen to me.

497
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,039
Okay. I'll teach you how to do it later.

498
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,399
But now, let's go for your injection first.

499
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:46,800
Are you serious, my idol?

500
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,320
It's not your first time.
Why are you doing this?

501
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,720
Can't I hate it just because
it's not my first time anymore?

502
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,399
Give me the key.

503
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,119
Do you think I won't dare to touch you?

504
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,320
I can go.

505
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,999
But in exchange,
tell me something that you regret doing.

506
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,800
So troublesome.

507
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,159
Why do I need to tell you something
that I regret doing?

508
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,080
Because I'll feel happier

509
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,159
when I hear about your regrets.

510
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,320
(I had a very good friend.)

511
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:26,840
(At first, we could be together.)

512
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,200
(But in the end,
we broke up because of a fight.)

513
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:31,960
(And then,)

514
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,080
(there's no going back for us anymore.)

515
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,200
What's your regret?

516
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:43,119
Getting into a fight
or breaking up with that person?

517
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,879
Both.

518
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,759
If I could do it again,

519
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,239
I wouldn't have left him so easily.

520
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,279
Even if he did something really bad,

521
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
even if I was so mad that I could kill him,

522
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:56,800
I should have stayed calm.

523
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,360
I shouldn't have fought with a fool.

524
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,239
Wait.

525
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,879
Are you sure
you didn't do anything wrong?

526
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,840
I was just stating the facts.
I didn't do anything wrong.

527
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,399
Fine.

528
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,480
Looks like your friend
did something terrible.

529
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,360
He was quite the scoundrel.

530
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,320
But I still miss him.

531
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:20,879
Then...

532
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,119
Did you go back to find him?

533
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:25,480
I did.

534
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,320
At first, I thought

535
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,919
that he would forget about me.

536
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:31,999
But I found out that it wasn't that bad.

537
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:34,080
It was not that good either.

538
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,440
Go straight to the point.
Have you reconciled?

539
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,600
It's not important.

540
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,919
It's better for us to stay where we are

541
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,840
and just treat him as a passer-by.

542
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,279
Passer-by?

543
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,039
It's less stressful
to be with a passer-by.

544
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:53,039
I don't have to consider our status.

545
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,919
And no memories are involved.

546
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:56,879
Although it may be short,

547
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,119
I'm already satisfied.

548
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,519
By the way,

549
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,039
is your hand better now?

550
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,680
It's still a little bit numb.

551
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,720
Maybe it's because I just had my injection.

552
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,560
Then,

553
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,759
move your hands around then.

554
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:23,159
I know you are stupid.

555
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,680
But I never thought
that you would be so stupid.

556
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:27,720
I don't think this ugly paper crane
will grant you a wish.

557
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,080
Enough.

558
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,399
Mr. Wei, An is here.

559
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:36,879
Your assistant is here.
I have to go now.

560
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:57,720
Mr. Wei.

561
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,159
Is the woman who just went out...

562
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,879
She's the crazy fan

563
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,560
who I told you about.

564
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,159
Don't worry. I know what
you are worried about.

565
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,720
She doesn't have any ill intentions
towards me. And she's not a paparazzo.

566
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,399
Okay. Let's talk about work.

567
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,320
Okay.

568
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,050
(Outpatient Department)

569
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,750
(Boss)

570
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,519
(Have you come up with an idea
to deal with Wei Qing?)

571
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,080
(The best way is to stay away from him.)

572
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,759
(Even if we don't collaborate
with Wei Qing,)

573
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,919
(we are still qualified enough
to participate in the Art Biennial.)

574
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:58,360
You want to collaborate with a painter?

575
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,440
Yes.

576
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,159
If we can find a painter

577
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,279
from the exhibition to collaborate with us,

578
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,840
not only can we exhibit our products,

579
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:08,119
we can also increase the popularity
of our brand through a famous person.

580
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,239
But Shangjue might have
the same idea too.

581
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,279
Look into it for me.

582
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:12,239
Okay.

583
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,879
Among the more than 70 institutions
participating in this exhibition,

584
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,360
the number of painters with individual
exhibitions is in the single digit.

585
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,519
And most of them are foreigners.

586
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,159
As for local painter...

587
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,919
Who?

588
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,440
Jason Wu, Master Wu Zheng.

589
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,600
Him?

590
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,840
Looks like Shangjue is doomed

591
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,800
even if I don't do anything about it.
