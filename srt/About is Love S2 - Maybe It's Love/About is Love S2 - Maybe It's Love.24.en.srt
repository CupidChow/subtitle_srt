Fei.

21
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,400
Fei?

22
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,760
Fei.

23
00:01:57,836 --> 00:01:58,956
Miss Lin has left.

24
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,000
Fei?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Fei?

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,080
Dad.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,390
What are you looking at?

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,080
Did you see Fei around?

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,630
Save yourself the trouble.

30
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,960
I have the key.

31
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,550
No, I didn't.

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,270
He... Did he escape through the window?

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,440
Did he go after that girl?

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Oh, how great love is.

35
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,830
If that's the case,

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,110
it's not entirely a bad thing.

37
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,550
Dad, should we report it to the police?

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,390
Report what? He ran off himself.

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,720
I'll give Ms. Xue a call.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,320
Why aren't they here yet?

41
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,520
There he is.

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,910
I got it.

43
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,470
Why is it just you?

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Where's she?

45
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,000
She should be here soon.

46
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,550
Why hasn't Feifei shown up?

47
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,440
Did Wu Zheng do something to her?

48
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,440
No.

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,360
Master Wu wouldn't harm Feifei.

50
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,390
Fei.

51
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,320
She's here.

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,550
How did it go? Did you find it?

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,110
Thanks to Wu Xiao.
I got it without much trouble.

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,320
Right.

55
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,600
Why did you say I bullied you?

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,110
When have I bullied you?

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,440
I was trying
to get Wu Zheng's attention.

58
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,030
Fine, here's something to compensate.

59
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,720
Alright, enough lingering.

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,240
Let's hurry to Dr. Chen's.

61
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,960
Thank you.

62
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,960
He has indeed regained his memory.

63
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,440
(Evaluation: Recalled memory)

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,480
Xue Zi will not be able to use amnesia
as an excuse

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,880
to overturn his actions.

66
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,670
You guys can ask him
to do a press conference

67
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,040
and expose Xue Zi's scheme
to the public.

68
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,480
Thanks, Dr. Chen.

69
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,350
Will the condition relapse?

70
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,920
We'll have to observe him
a while longer.

71
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,480
There's a prescription.

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,880
I prescribed some medication for him.

73
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,160
Make sure he takes them on time.

74
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,830
If any problem arises,

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,230
come find me any time.

76
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,440
When can he be discharged then?

77
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,760
He can leave today.

78
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,920
You can take him home
after you get the medicine.

79
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,760
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,550
You're welcome.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,040
We'll go take the medicine now.

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,070
Let's go.

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,760
Where are they?

84
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,640
Feifei has a heatstroke.

85
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,670
They went to get Feifei water.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,550
We're the only two here.

87
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,440
Can you tell me why now?

88
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,160
Actually, when I was abroad,

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,830
I already knew Xue Zi had something
in her possession

90
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,950
that could harm Uncle and you.

91
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,880
But Xue Zi has been very cautious of me.

92
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,200
I couldn't find what it was.

93
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,600
Later,

94
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,670
Zhou Shi and I got into the accident.

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,390
When I woke up,

96
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,440
I no longer remembered anything.

97
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,880
When did you regain your memory?

98
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,270
The day I was sent to the hospital
for alcohol poisoning.

99
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,350
(I realized
when I regained consciousness)

100
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,720
(that you guys probably needed me.)

101
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
I couldn't continue living in denial.

102
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,110
I had to finish
all the unfinished business.

103
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,200
(But I didn't think
I could do it alone.)

104
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,720
(So I went to find Zhou Shi.)

105
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,600
(We agreed to put on an act.)

106
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,160
Your plan was good and all,

107
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,230
but Yunma's reputation

108
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,830
has undeniably been tarnished.

109
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,830
I'm sorry, Wei Qing. But,

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,510
if I hadn't done it,

111
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,510
Xue Zi wouldn't have dropped her guard.

112
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,550
And we wouldn't have been able
to get the diary. Besides...

113
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,440
Besides, your dear Zhou Shi

114
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,550
wanted to let me have a taste
of my own medicine.

115
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,760
She wanted me to know

116
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,000
how awful it feels
to be kept in the dark, right?

117
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,320
You already knew.

118
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,720
So you saw through me a long time ago.

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,510
But you chose to keep quiet, right?

120
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,320
Zhou Shi.

121
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,760
All the best.

122
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,720
I did not.

123
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,670
Hey.

124
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,640
Why are you angry again?

125
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,070
Because you're doing it again.

126
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
You clearly knew,

127
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,040
but you wanted to watch me
make a fool of myself.

128
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,760
I did not.

129
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,670
I didn't see through everything.

130
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,600
I only noticed a few clues.

131
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,720
If you have to blame something,
blame it on my being too intelligent.

132
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,480
I couldn't help but notice.

133
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,200
People say,

134
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,040
being in love makes you become stupid.

135
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,830
Then just enjoy our loving relationship.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Maybe my intelligence

137
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,390
would be lowered then.

138
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,640
What do you mean by that?

139
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,000
Are you saying I'm detrimental
to your intelligence?

140
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,440
No, I'm not. I...

141
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,830
You're not.

142
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,040
Alright.

143
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,640
I knew you'd find out.

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,390
I'm just...

145
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,640
a little upset about it.

146
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,320
Next time,

147
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,950
I'll tell you everything I'm doing.

148
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,440
I'll be your strongest support.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,640
Whatever you wish to do,
I will support you.

150
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,950
Next time,
I will give you my full trust.

151
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,320
And you can have your little secrets.

152
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,390
But anything important that involves me,

153
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,830
you have to discuss with me.

154
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,320
We'll make the decision together.

155
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,200
Alright?

156
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,510
It's a deal.

157
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,640
It's been a day.

158
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,920
Still no news.

159
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,480
He must have been taken by Wei Qing.

160
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,600
Sister.

161
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,200
You've lost.

162
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,480
Ms. Xue,
you've got two guests here to see you.

163
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,670
Let them in.

164
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,320
(Prescription for Xue Ning, Diary)
You want to take back the copyright

165
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,110
with these two things?

166
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,200
What if I don't agree?

167
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,350
I trust that you've read

168
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,910
the latter part of the diary.

169
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,350
Back then, Mr. Ning

170
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,230
suffered from mental illness

171
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,230
due to his work not being appreciated.

172
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,590
He did write a lot of things

173
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,030
slandering my father.

174
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,790
But my father later found him

175
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,150
and took him to get treatment.

176
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,470
He realized

177
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,230
he had misunderstood my father.

178
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
It is clearly written in the diary.

179
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,440
So long as I reveal these contents,

180
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,230
I'm sure the negative sentiment

181
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,080
will quickly disperse.

182
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,000
Also, Ning Fei has recovered.

183
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,200
We can organize a press conference
at any time.

184
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,110
Together with the treatment record,

185
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,880
I reckon it makes for a convincing case.

186
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,790
So you guys are fully prepared.

187
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,320
Why did you come to see me then?

188
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,670
To ridicule me?

189
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,910
Actually, we came

190
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,670
because we wish to work with you.

191
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,640
Work with me?

192
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,320
You only need to stop interfering

193
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,640
in Ning Fei's life.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,080
And I'll continue
my partnership with Snow

195
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,280
to jointly organize

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,520
Shan He and Xunran's
father and son exhibition.

197
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,440
What do you think?

198
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,590
Is this sincere enough?

199
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,840
What is your condition?

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,200
Organize a press conference.

201
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,110
Admit that you were wrong
about my father

202
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,440
and formally apologize to him.

203
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,880
I will provide you with the script.

204
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,470
It will not jeopardize
Snow's reputation.

205
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,400
This time,

206
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,790
I am in the wrong.

207
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,710
I shouldn't have used such methods
to get what I wanted.

208
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,640
Mr. Wei.

209
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,470
Here's to a good partnership.

210
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,080
Here's to both of us winning.

211
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,840
I will conduct the press conference
soonest possible

212
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,200
and explain everything.

213
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,280
You actually hung it up.

214
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,470
You gifted it to me.

215
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,230
Of course, I have to keep it well.

216
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
I grew up in the Snow family.

217
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,640
As a member of the clan,

218
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,080
I have to do what's best
for the company's interests.

219
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,080
You guys must hate me.

220
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,520
I never said I hated you.

221
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,200
Do you really not hate me?

222
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,150
This whole time,

223
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,000
I could only

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,550
watch you quietly from afar.

225
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,150
I watched how you climbed
higher and higher.

226
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,110
I've always wished that one day,

227
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,320
I could stand with you.

228
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,110
So you could have a battle with me?

229
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,110
To let you know

230
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,230
that I'm as good as you are.

231
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,670
It's too bad.

232
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm still too weak.

233
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,230
If you were weak,

234
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,520
I need not have used Wei Qing
to take you down.

235
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,790
If we wish to beat Wei Qing,

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,350
I won't be able to do it alone.

237
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,110
So hurry up and become stronger.

238
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,910
I will.

239
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,320
It's so beautiful.

240
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,030
Do you see that star?

241
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,760
What is it?

242
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,910
Idiot. It's the Northern Star.

243
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,760
Have you ever thought,

244
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,640
what if I never recovered my memory?

245
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,520
What will you do then?

246
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,230
Of course, I have.

247
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,320
At first, it was upsetting.

248
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,710
But later, I came to a realization.

249
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,640
Whether or not you remember

250
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
doesn't really matter.

251
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,230
Because

252
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,550
I remember.

253
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,670
Our love

254
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,550
will not disappear
along with your memory.

255
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,470
Because it has infused itself
into my life,

256
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,440
bit by bit.

257
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,550
I remember something Zhou Shi told me.

258
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,590
She said

259
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,200
her relationship with Wei Qing

260
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,840
was somehow guided by something.

261
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,280
If we had to explain it,

262
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,110
maybe it's love.

263
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,670
I think I was able to regain my memory

264
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,790
because of this too.

265
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,280
Maybe it's love.

266
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,590
When did you become so cringy?

267
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,000
Maybe it's love?

268
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,670
If it's love, it's love.
What's with the "maybe"?

269
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,790
Anyway, I know I love you.

270
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,080

Can it be treated?

From the scan,

298
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,840
we see that it is quite an old injury.

299
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,790
Although it can be treated

300
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,200
with the current medical technology,

301
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
she has already missed

302
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,000
the best time to do so.

303
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,840
Don't worry.

304
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,550
Let's consult with another doctor.

305
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,030
Your hand has an old injury.

306
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,590
The qi and blood circulation
are blocked.

307
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,080
The possibility of recovery
through taking medication is low.

308
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,440
Is there any other way to treat it?

309
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,520
You have to do weekly acupuncture
and regular rehabilitation.

310
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,670
Only then can you hope for any success.

311
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,030
But it takes time.

312
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,960
What does rehabilitation mean?

313
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,440
You mentioned that she likes to draw.

314
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,320
Then draw every day.

315
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,790
And come for acupuncture regularly.

316
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Remember, you need to be persistent.

317
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,080
I'll persist.

318
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,320
I definitely will. Thank you, Doctor.

319
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,840
How is your hand?

320
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,670
I heard from Wei Qing

321
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,440
that you're painting
every day and night.

322
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,880
He's worried about you.

323
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,080
There are improvements.

324
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,760
But not very obvious ones.

325
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,080
Take it slow.
Being hasty could backfire.

326
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm here today

327
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,000
because I need a favor from you.

328
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,960
I'm wondering if you're free?

329
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,320
Miss Brainiac's favor is my own.

330
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,230
What is it?

331
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,760
Fei wants to propose to Feifei.

332
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,960
Really?

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,880
That kid is finally making a move.

334
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,790
He's thinking of how to propose.

335
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,910
But because my
and Li Mingcheng's preferences

336
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,030
are more unique,

337
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,030
he thinks it'd be better to ask you

338
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,200
to help decorate the proposal venue.

339
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,550
Why didn't he ask me himself?

340
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,550
Feifei has been
sticking to him like glue.

341
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,080
He has no chance to get away.

342
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,000
So he asked me to pass the message.

343
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,710
Alright. Let's get started then.

344
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

345
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,550
Why are you inflating so many balloons?

346
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,910
Mingcheng said

347
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,000
there were always balloons
when proposing in TV shows.

348
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,350
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

349
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,400
It's old-fashioned.

350
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,470
Zhou Shi, give me some ideas.

351
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,470
How do I decorate

352
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,230
in order to create the perfect setting?

353
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,030
Anything indoors is old-fashioned.

354
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,880
Why don't we do it outdoors?

355
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,790
I know of a place
where there are fireflies.

356
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,920
It's really pretty.
We can set it up there.

357
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,640
Okay.

358
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,350
Alright. We'll work separately.

359
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,920
Wei Qing, you and I
will get the plan ready.

360
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,470
Mingcheng, Miss Brainiac,

361
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,000
go and get fresh flowers and some props.

362
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,000
Fei, get in touch with a hotel.

363
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Best if you can have fireworks.

364
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,070
No problem.

365
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,830
It's Feifei. Keep quiet.

366
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,640
Feifei.

367
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Where are you?

368
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,760
I'm at home. What's the matter?

369
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,680
I suspect Ning Fei's cheating on me.

370
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,280
Cheating on you?

371
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,190
There's no way.

372
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,350
He's been acting suspicious these days.

373
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,280
He sneaks looks at his phone.

374
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,710
I checked his pocket
and found a hotel receipt.

375
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,400
He secretly got a room in a hotel.

376
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
What else could it be?

377
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,680
That's impossible. Calm down.

378
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,110
It's hard to explain.

379
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,110
I'm sending you the location.
Meet me there.

380
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,400
What? You want to tell me face-to-face?

381
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,950
Are you sure?

382
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,710
Feifei is coming.

383
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,640
We have to hurry up. Come on!

384
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,470
Let's go.

385
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,830
(Hurry, be quick.)

386
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,230
What is this place?

387
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,430
Look.

388
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,070
Are those fireflies?

389
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,590
It's so beautiful.

390
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,430
But why did you bring me here?

391
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,680
There's a show.

392
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,920
I heard it's really nice.

393
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,590
Ma'am, I'm not in the mood
to watch a show.

394
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,920
I need to catch that cheater!

395
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,520
Hang on. It'll be quick.

396
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,470
Come this way.

397
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,680
Quick.

398
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,430
What's going on?

399
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,000

Yes.

- Remember not to be late.

Yes, it's a very important meeting.

00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,520
- Make sure to be on time.
- You have to be more meticulous.

503
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,560
Excuse me.

504
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,110
Could you please put away your phones?

505
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,310
- Hang on.
- Hang on.

506
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,430
I'll talk to you later. I have to go.

507
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,760
I'm taking my wedding photos right now.

508
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,880
- We'll talk later.
- Bye-bye.

509
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,310
Go ahead.

510
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,110
Take the photo.

511
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,350
Sorry.

512
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,880
Is it done?

513
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,710
Yes, looks good.

514
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,350
Are you two really getting married?

515
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,760
What else are we doing then?
Are we pretending to get married?

516
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,680
Is it your own decision?

517
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,230
Of course, it is.

518
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,680
Can we get changed?

519
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Yes.

520
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,190
I'm going to be late.

521
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,230
Don't worry.

522
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,710
There's still time.

523
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,160
It's raining. Drive slowly.

524
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,710
I will.

525
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,880
What is it?

526
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,640
Are we really married?

527
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,520
We are really married.

528
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,920
It's just that we haven't had
the wedding ceremony.

529
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,880
It just feels unreal.

530
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,800
No wonder he asked us
whether we were truly married.

531
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,680
It only just dawned on me

532
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,760
that we are indeed married.

533
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,710
We've been too busy lately.

534
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,520
That's why everything
seems like a dream.

535
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,070
Do you think

536
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,760
we'll be like this in the future?

537
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,190
Minding our own business.

538
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,280
Like two colleagues who live together.

539
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,400
No way.

540
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,310
What are you doing?

541
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,310
I work hard

542
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,230
not because I want to be your colleague.

543
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,190
Today is the day we get our certificate.

544
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,520
I'll put my work aside.

545
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,430
I just want to be with you,

546
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,830
my dearest wife.

547
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,940
(Powering off)

548
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,190
Hubby, where shall we go?

549
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,040
Wifey can decide.

550
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,340
(Information Desk)

551
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:52,275
(Urine pregnancy test, positive)

552
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,430
Now you can get excited.

553
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,350
I'm going to be a dad!

554
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,830
Thank you, Darling.

555
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,680
Looks like there's a new subject

556
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
we have to tackle together.

557
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,920
With you here,

558
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,400
no subject is too hard.

559
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,190
Wrong.

560
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,190
It's with the two of us here,

561
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,070
we can tackle any subject.

562
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,280
Please guide me well, Ms. Bi.

563
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,470
Likewise,

564
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,830
Mr. Li.

565
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,590
It's been so long since we had
so much fun.

566
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,160
I'm actually feeling tired.

567
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,470
Yeah, the three big occasions in life.

568
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,430
Receiving top honor.

569
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,590
Having a long-felt need satisfied.

570
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,950
Lighting up the bridal chamber.

571
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,800
We've completed one.

572
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,190
Do you still have energy?

573
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,110
I'll get the door.

574
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,040
Such a bummer.

575
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,350
- I'll cut the fruits.
- Okay.

576
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,590
Miss Brainiac, Mingcheng.

577
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,160
Come, come inside.

578
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,830
You must be tired. Come and sit.

579
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,590
Shishi, congrats on getting
your marriage certificate.

580
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,560
Thank you.

581
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,800
Why did you come so early?

582
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,160
Feifei asked us to come first.

583
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,470
She wants us to wait for her here.

584
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Is the big celebrity
making a grand entrance?

585
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,400
Today, you're officially married.

586
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,920
For sure, we have to come.

587
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,040
Besides, she said she had good news

588
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,920
to announce.

589
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,160
Good news?

590
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,880
Did she get a big role?

591
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,760
We have good news too.

592
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,430
Qiujing

593
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,110
is pregnant.

594
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,470
Really?

595
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,880
When did you find out?

596
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,230
Just this afternoon.

597
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,560
Did you guys forget that I exist?

598
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,350
We wouldn't forget you.

599
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,710
Come here.

600
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,590
Allow me to introduce to you,

601
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,430
my husband.

602
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,560
Okay, you guys chat.

603
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,920
Mingcheng and I will cook.

604
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,160
Cook?

605
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,000
Are you sure? Don't embarrass me.

606
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,760
Please, for the past half a year,

607
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,310
you've been teaching me how to cook.

608
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,110
It's not going to be a problem.

609
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,280
Give Feifei a call

610
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
and ask them where they are.

611
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,680
Okay.

612
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,710
- Come on.
- Get cooking.

613
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,760
I'll get cracking then.

614
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,470
Here.

615
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,880
Have some fruits.

616
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,590
(Go on.)

617
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,430
What happened then?

618
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,110
Then, they left.

619
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,880
I gave them whatever they wanted.

620
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,880
I thought tomorrow's headline news

621
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,350
would be Yunma's acquisition.

622
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,830
But now it seems like
it's going to be you guys.

623
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,680
That's because Feifei
is more famous than you. Just admit it.

624
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,000
Why did you two also choose

625
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,110
to get married today?

626
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,950
Because...

627
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,070
I know!

628
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,920
Today is Fei's birthday.

629
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,560
He's officially 22.

630
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,920
Feifei, I've got to hand it to you.

631
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,880
You couldn't even wait one more minute.

632
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,070
What? It's what I want.

633
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,830
So when are you two
going to do the ceremony?

634
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,070
That's what

635
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,950
I wanted to talk to you guys about.

636
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,760
Since we got our marriage certificates
on the same day,

637
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,830
why don't we have
the ceremony together too?

638
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,470
Okay, I agree.

639
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,560
Me too.

640
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,070
If both couples are doing the ceremony,

641
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,710
who am I going to be the bridesmaid for?

642
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,950
- Us!
- Us!

643
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,830
A toast

644
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,040
to your happy marriage. Cheers!

645
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,680
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

646
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,280
Upstairs, please.

647
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,880
How do you feel? Nervous?

648
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,920
What is there to be nervous about?

649
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,430
Guess you're still a boy
and lack experience.

650
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,950
It's your first time too.

651
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,640
You talk

652
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,680
as if you secretly did stuff
behind our backs.

653
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,070
No, he's not experienced in this.

654
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,950
But yes, he is not so young.

655
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,920
You two seem to be in sync.

656
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,950
Doing crosstalk?

657
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,000
Li Mingcheng, watch your attitude.

658
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,350
I'm still your boss.

659
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,430
You misunderstood me.

660
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,830
What I meant

661
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,070
is you're mature and well-versed.

662
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,400
That's why you're not nervous.

663
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
What is he doing here?

664
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,800
Rest assured. We've reconciled.

665
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,830
She won't cause trouble at the wedding.

666
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,350
I'm not talking about her.

667
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,000
Today is your wedding day.

668
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,880
He should be the one to feel upset.

669
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,280
The three giants of Yunma
are here to welcome us.

670
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm honored.

671
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,760
Ms. Xue made time
to attend the ceremony.

672
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,520
Of course,
I have to return the courtesy.

673
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,800
Sister.

674
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,760
The gift.

675
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,500
(Shan He)

676
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,680
Two couples are getting married today.

677
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,640
Did you only prepare one gift?

678
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
How are we going to divide it?

679
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,950
This is my present to you both.

680
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,920
It's a treasured painting of Fei's dad.

681
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,350
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

682
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Thank you, sis.

683
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,000
Thanks, Ms. Xue.

684
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,830
It's almost time.

685
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,280
We have to get ready.

686
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,470
Sorry, we can't stay

687
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,830
and chat.

688
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,710
Please take your seats inside. Let's go.

689
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,710
Are you really going to stay?

690
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,880
I want to see her in a wedding dress.

691
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,520
Even though it's not for me.

692
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,560
Let's go.

693
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,880
Let us welcome the two couples.

694
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,800
Wei Qing, do you take Zhou Shi

695
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,280
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

696
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
I do.

697
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,520
Ning Fei.

698
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,310
Do you take Lin Feifei

699
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,880
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

700
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,640
I do.

701
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,110
Zhou Shi, do you take Wei Qing
as your lawfully wedded husband?

702
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,880
I do.

703
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,280
Lin Feifei.

704
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,470
Do you take Ning Fei
as your lawfully wedded husband?

705
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,760
Of course, I do.

706
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,470
In the sacred institution of marriage,

707
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,360
will you be together

708
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,470
in sickness and in health,

709
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,710
for richer, for poorer?

710
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,000
Do you promise to love
and cherish each other,

711
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,120
respect each other,

712
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,390
protect each other,

713
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,430
and be faithful to each other
for so long as you both shall live?

714
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,910
- I do!
- I do!

715
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,040
Please exchange wedding rings.

716
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,500
(Zhou Shi's
individual thematic exhibition)

717
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,360
It's finally over. I'm exhausted.

718
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
You're already exhausted?

719
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,710
This is only the first day
of your exhibition.

720
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,670
It will be the same for the whole week.

721
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,080
What are you going to do then?

722
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,630
My legs are sore.

723
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,710
Too bad Feifei and the rest didn't come.

724
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,600
I did this specially for them.

725
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,910
Did you really think they were busy?

726
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,600
Are you saying

727
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,670
they purposely gave me an excuse
not to come

728
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,760
so they could give me a surprise?

729
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,000
I think they are almost here.

730
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,600
Why don't we...?

731
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,700
(Audience Entrance)

732
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,870
Why is no one here?

733
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,390
Look. She painted us.

734
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,760
She even captured my micro expression.

735
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,040
Do you think they really believed

736
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,120
we wouldn't come?

737
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,320
Didn't I say we should come earlier?

738
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,670
They probably left
since everyone's gone.

739
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,760
No way.

740
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,430
If it's Wei Qing,

741
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,840
he surely knows we didn't show up
on purpose.

742
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,870
And then he'll get us back.

743
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,760
As expected of Miss Brainiac.

744
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,080
Nothing gets past you.

745
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,040
Congratulations.

746
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,870
Congrats.

747
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,870
Thank you.

748
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,910
Zhou Shi. These paintings.

749
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,670
Did you draw them all?

750
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,120
I prepared this personal exhibition
for you guys.

751
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,840
They are our memories.

752
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,840
Miss Brainiac, Mingcheng,

753
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,470
Fei, Feifei.

754
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,600
I'm thankful

755
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,230
for your companionship.

756
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,520
For the remaining days,

757
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,710
I hope you guys will always be here.

758
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,870
Five seconds.

759
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,560
Five, Four, three, two, one.

760
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,950
- Maybe it's love!
- Maybe it's love!

761
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Let's have Japanese food.

762
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,760
We need some cooling.

763
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,320
Wait here.

764
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,280
Which tabloid do you work for,
taking photos secretly?

765
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,800
I'm sorry. I wasn't photographing you.

766
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,560
I was photographing him.
