30

Don't you want to marry me?

31
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,600
Of course I want to.

32
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,270
Then why are you rejecting me?

33
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm willing to support you
with everything I have.

I hope you can be happy.

Having you with me

43

is enough to make me happy.

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,600
But if it's marriage,

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,390
now's not the right time.

46
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,630
Why?

47
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,340
(He knows.)

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,320
You're back.

49
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,320
Show me.

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,000
What happened? You didn't propose?

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,160
I did.

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,800
He said no.

53
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,270
He said no?

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,190
How could that be?

55
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,750
Why would he reject you?

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,240
I'd like to know too.

57
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,190
Come on, tell me.

58
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,960
How did he reject you?

59
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
I'll help you analyze it.

60
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,440
I asked him to marry me.

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,000
He said no.

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,240
I said I'd stay by his side forever

63
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,670
and help him get to the top again.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,440
He said what if

65
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,720
he couldn't get to the top?
Then I said...

66
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,550
Wait a second.

67
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,720
He said what if he couldn't

68
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,880
get to the top again?

69
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,360
I see.

70
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,110
What is it?

71
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,790
He doesn't want to drag you down.

72
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,230
Think about it. Who is Wei Qing?

73
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,950
He became Yunma's chairman

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,830
in his early 20s.

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,320
He's never experienced
any severe hardship along the way.

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,640
Then suddenly,

77
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,350
he was betrayed by a trusted friend.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,720
The Yunma he built with his hands
was taken from him.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,040
Who could endure that?

80
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,230
Me? I wouldn't be able to.

81
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,920
I don't think so. He's not you.

82
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,000
He wouldn't be beaten that easily.

83
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,270
That's the crux of the problem.

84
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,950
We think he won't be beaten.

85
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,320
He also thinks he won't lose.

86
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,480
But the result is he lost.

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,320
But he's just playing games every day.

88
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,270
He's taking things easy.

89
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,040
That's all for show.

90
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,070
The more normal he seems,
the more worrisome it is.

91
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,160
Just like Frank.

92
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,040
Who?

93
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,230
Frank.

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,550
A talented commander.

95
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,510
Despite being in countless battles,
he managed to survive.

96
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,790
In the end,

97
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,480
a freak accident made him blind.

98
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,070
Thereafter, he was hit hard

99
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
and lost his will to live.

100
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
His life no longer had meaning.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,760
So one day,

102
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,270
he decided to take a trip.

103
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,350
Drinking, eating,
enjoying himself along the way.

104
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,000
Without a worry on his mind.

105
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,670
But his final destination is...

106
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,040
Isn't that a movie?

107
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,880
What has Wei Qing got to do with it?

108
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,760
Listen to me.

109
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,230
Wei Qing went through
a big ordeal this time.

110
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,510
Becoming emotional

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,390
and depressed is the normal reaction.

112
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,160
The more normal he is,

113
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,670
the more we should be worried.

114
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,950
(Three.)

115
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,760
(Two.)

116
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,620
(Do it!)

117
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,900
(Everyone makes mistakes.
You should move on.)

118
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,940
(The heck.)

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,000
Come in.

120
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,200
Hello, I am Li Mingcheng.

121
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,830
Li Mingcheng?

122
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,070
I've heard of you.

123
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,950
You're Yunma's chairman's

124
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,390
right-hand man.

125
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
How come you chose to interview with us?

126
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,550
To be frank, instead of the company,

127
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,670
I'm more interested in you.

128
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,790
Me?

129
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,363
(Share Acquisition Agreement)

130
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
Mr. Wei.

131
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,070
He said he'd think about it.

132
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,350
Do you think he'll help us?

133
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,510
He's mostly surveying the situation.

134
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,270
He won't dare to upset either side.

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,510
I need you to keep a close eye.

136
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,830
Inform me if anything. That's all.

137
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,830
Okay.

138
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Madam, what are we having for lunch?

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,110
Madam?

140
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,640
Oh, right.

141
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,200
Madam is on leave today. She's not home.

142
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,830
How do I prepare this?

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,040
Wei Qing, are you awake?

144
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,950
(Why is she here?)

145
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,830
(I must not let her see my cut.)

146
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
What are you doing?

147
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,000
Why are you here?

148
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,720
I came to keep you company.

149
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,950
Why?

150
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,160
Am I not welcomed?

151
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,350
Very welcomed.

152
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,760
Take a seat. I have to go to the toilet.

153
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,720
Why is he being so weird?

154
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,000
This looks like fresh blood.

155
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,960
(No way.)

156
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,110
(Is it really like what Feifei said?)

157
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,550
What are you doing?

158
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,230
I'm cutting the fruits.

159
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,960
This knife is dull.
There's a new one in the kitchen.

160
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,640
Hey.

161
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,960
(Wait.)

162
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,670
(If I probe him,)

163
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,230
(it might trigger him.)

164
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,440
You haven't eaten, right?

165
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,280
What would you like?
I'll make it for you.

166
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,440
Anything is fine.

167
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,790
(His eyes are wavering.)

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,470
(He must be hiding something.)

169
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,400
(If she finds out
I can't even peel fruit,)

170
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,670
(she'll definitely make fun of me.)

171
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm going to cook.

172
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,550
Okay.

173
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,200
Help me...

174
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,670
What are you doing?

175
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
My leg just got a cramp.

176
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,470
It's numb.

177
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,640
What is it?

178
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,910
Come help me cook.

179
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,470
Okay.

180
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,030
Come here.

181
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
My leg hurts.

182
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,280
(He keeps hiding his left hand
under the table.)

183
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,230
(Did he cut his left hand?)

184
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,710
(The bleeding should've stopped by now.)

185
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,080
(I need to remove the band-aid.)

186
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,710
(Or else she'll notice.)

187
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,520
Why do you keep looking at me?

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,230
Who's looking at you, Mr. Vain?

189
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,030
(Oh, no. He can't really
be thinking that, right?)

190
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,230
What are you thinking about?

191
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm thinking

192
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,030
it's been a while
since we met up with the rest.

193
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,520
Should we have a gathering?

194
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,030
Didn't we just eat at Mingcheng's

195
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,440
two days ago?

196
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,440
Feifei wasn't there though.

197
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,550
Well?

198
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,470
How about inviting them over
for a party?

199
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,880
It's fine with me. Whatever you like.

200
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,400
Don't you like it?

201
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,840
Why do you seem so weird today?

202
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,910
Who's weird?

203
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,030
It's settled then. I'll inform them.

204
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,960
Eat.

205
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,710
Feifei.

206
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,280
I'm organizing a party
at Wei Qing's tomorrow.

207
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,000
Make sure you come.

208
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,880
Okay.

209
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,030
Bye-bye.

210
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,320
What is it?

211
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,400
Are you done shooting?

212
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,910
But you're the one
who asked me to take photos.

213
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,350
I asked you to photograph me.

214
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,710
But not secretly.

215
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,590
I wasn't photographing you.

216
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,960
I was photographing the scenery.

217
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,790
Let me see then.

218
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,840
No.

219
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,520
You were secretly photographing me.
No need to deny it.

220
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,790
Anyway, Zhou Shi
is having a party tomorrow.

221
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,320
Let's go get her a gift later.

222
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,470
We can't go empty-handed.

223
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,440
Okay.

224
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,880
Come on. Let's go somewhere else.

225
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,200
Listen up. No more paparazzi photos.

226
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,080
Got it.

227
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,400
Is everyone clear?

228
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,200
Feifei.

229
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,030
Yes, ma'am.

230
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,640
The little rascal and I
will be mood-makers.

231
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,150
Mingcheng?

232
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,150
I'll keep an eye

233
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,760
on Mr. Wei's mood.

234
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,320
Once anything happens,
I'll react immediately.

235
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,230
Shishi, are you sure about Mr. Wei?

236
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,840
I don't think he'll commit suicide.

237
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,910
But there's clearly
something wrong with him.

238
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,590
He's being so secretive.

239
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,000
I prefer

240
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,520
to be safe than sorry.

241
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,280
It's better to err
on the side of caution.

242
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,960
Miss Brainiac.

243
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,710
My job is to have
a one-on-one counseling session

244
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,590
with Wei Qing once the mood is right.

245
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,670
Very good.

246
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,440
Does anyone have any questions?

247
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,760
I do.

248
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,320
Why am I the one counseling Wei Qing?

249
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,670
If I were to do it,

250
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,280
it might pressure him too much.

251
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,590
Feifei is only suited
to be a relationship counselor.

252
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,280
She's no good at life lessons.

253
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,880
Among us, you're the most reasonable.

254
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,350
Plus, Wei Qing has always admired you.

255
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,150
So, he'd most likely listen to you.

256
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,710
Actually, I also think Wei Qing is fine.

257
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,200
You're just thinking too much.

258
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
It'd be best

259
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,470
if there's no problem.

260
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,200
But just in case, you know?

261
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,640
Alright, if there's no more question,

262
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,880
let's do it!

263
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,350
(The game is simple. Two in a group.)

264
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,550
(Use your mouth to transfer the flour)

265
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,960
(into the empty bowl over there.)

266
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,670
(The time limit is 3 minutes.)

267
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,110
(The pair who transfers
the most flour wins.)

268
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,640
(The losing pair will be responsible)

269
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,350
(for washing the dishes
and cleaning up.)

270
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,280
Hurry up, you.

271
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,880
I need to use the washroom.

272
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,960
I'll check on him.

273
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,280
I'll go grab a towel.

274
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280
I'll go too.

275
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,440
Why are you all going to the toilet?

276
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,840
The more the merrier.

277
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,150
Why aren't you joining them?

278
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,640
Since they're gone,

279
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,790
let's have a chat.

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,030
You and me?

281
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,400
Chat about what?

282
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,080
We can talk about
your current mental state.

283
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,550
Can you guys hear what they're saying?

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,080
No.

285
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,470
I can only see their mouths moving.

286
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,230
Seems like they're conversing well.

287
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,670
Have you been sleeping well these days?

288
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,280
Not too bad.

289
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,520
Any trouble sleeping or dreaming a lot?

290
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,110
No. Why do you ask?

291
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,640
Thanks.

292
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,710
Miss Brainiac seems to be vomiting.

293
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,910
No.

294
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,550
Darling.

295
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,350
Are you okay?

296
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,880
What's wrong?

297
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,320
What did you tell her?

298
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,760
Why is she vomiting?

299
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,320
I didn't say anything.

300
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,590
She was talking
and suddenly became nauseated.

301
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,590
This morning, she also vomited at home.

302
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,960
She said she was dizzy.

303
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,150
I was going to bring her

304
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,230
to the hospital for a checkup.

305
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,080
But she said it was only temporary

306
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,960
and it doesn't have a pattern,

307
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,400
so she doesn't need to
go to the hospital.

308
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,640
I have a very bold opinion.

309
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Me too.

310
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,910
Congratulations, Mingcheng.

311
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,400
I think you'll be promoted soon.

312
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,280
What? What's happened?

313
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,000
You little kid can stay out of it.

314
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,760
Right.

315
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,080
Actually, the thought

316
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,550
did cross my mind.

317
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,710
But I couldn't be sure.

318
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,960
Darling.

319
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,440
Are you okay?

320
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,790
How long have you been feeling sick?

321
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,000
Are you having mood swings?

322
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,320
Are you getting your period normally?

323
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,110
Darling, are you...

324
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,200
Stop.

325
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,710
Before I can answer,

326
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,320
I'll have to check first.

327
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,590
I'm going to be a godmother!

328
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,880
What is the matter with you?

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,280
Have some courtesy.

330
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,080
I knew her first.
So I'm going to be the godmother.

331
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,840
I don't care. I'm the godmother.

332
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,960
Darling, where did you get
the pregnancy kit from?

333
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,080
I've been feeling nauseated
and flustered lately.

334
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
Symptoms of being pregnant.

335
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,550
So I prepared a pregnancy test kit

336
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,710
to check.

337
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,790
But the result of these kits

338
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,030
are not 100 percent.

339
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,840
So it's better I get a blood test
at the hospital first

340
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,840
before you guys celebrate.

341
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're right.

342
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,960
Let's go right away.

343
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,840
No need to rush.

344
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,790
Today is the weekend.
It will be crowded.

345
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
We'll be in the queue for a long time.

346
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,550
Besides, there's currently a bad bout
of respiratory infection.

347
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,440
For safety purposes,

348
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,790
we should go on another day.

349
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,000
Your baby's godmother, I,

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,110
can go with you.

351
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,030
I have a car. I'll take you there.

352
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,320
I'm the baby's godmother.

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,030
I'll be the godfather.

354
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,030
I can drive you there too.

355
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,030
Oh, come on.

356
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,400
You're making it sound like
she doesn't have her own car.

357
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,440
Miss Brainiac.

358
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,350
I'd like to be the godfather too.

359
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,150
You? A punk like you is too young
to be a godfather.

360
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,670
If it's Zhou Shi and Wei Qing...

361
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,710
Hold on.

362
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,840
Are you saying a pair
has a higher chance?

363
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,790
Come here, you.

364
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,640
No.

365
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,070
Wait a minute.

366
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,560
As for the godparents,
we can talk about it later.

367
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,430
Zhou Shi it is then.

368
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,160
Why? Just because I don't have a car?

369
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,190
Who are you looking down on?

370
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,950
Because Zhou Shi is the better cook.

371
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,800
Just take the loss.

372
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,280
Because your cooking

373
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,680
is as good as poison.

374
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Little baby, I'm your godmother.

375
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,280
Call me Miss Zhou Shi.

376
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Hold on.

377
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,640
I think the appellation is incorrect.

378
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,110
I call the shots.

379
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,470
Little baby...

380
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,950
About the car...

381
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,160
I wonder if it's a boy or girl.

382
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,760
What should the name be?

383
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,230
You are really excited about it.

384
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,640
Of course. I'm the godmother-to-be.

385
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,950
If you like kids so much,

386
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,160
you can just have one of your own.

387
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
How?

388
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,000
Asexual reproduction or mitosis?

389
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,040
Before you give birth,
you have to get married first.

390
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,830
From what I remember,

391
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,640
someone rejected my marriage proposal.

392
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,710
I told you.

393
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,680
It's not that I don't want to. It's...

394
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,830
Because the time isn't right.

395
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,190
Then when is the right time?

396
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,190
Don't misunderstand.

397
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,710
I just casually asked.

398
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,920
You can choose not to answer.

399
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,310
Anyway, did you have fun today?

400
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,230
I did.

401
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,430
Really?

402
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,830
(This is odd. What is she really up to?)

403
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,070
What are you doing?

404
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm cutting the fruits.

405
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,230
Why do you keep looking at me?

406
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,680
Who's looking at you?

407
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,160
Since they're gone,

408
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,310
let's have a chat.

409
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,830
You and me?

410
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,830
Chat about what?

411
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,880
We can talk about
your current mental state.

412
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,880
(So she's worried
I'd do something stupid.)

413
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,560
I'm always happy when I'm with you.

414
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,000
But...

415
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,400
This is just temporary.

416
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,000
Because

417
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,350
after I get you home safely,

418
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,040
I'll be alone again.

419
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,070
I can't find the drive to do anything.

420
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,800
When it's all quiet,

421
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,310
I start thinking all sorts.

422
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,000
So if I'm with you all the time,

423
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,920
will you stop thinking nonsense?

424
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,400
Yes.

425
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,950
Are you sure?

426
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,430
The way he is now,

427
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,070
I can't leave him alone.

428
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,350
I understand.

429
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,310
All the best.

430
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,040
Once everything is okay,

431
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,110
go and get your marriage certificate.

432
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,110
Don't make your friends worry too.

433
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,560
You too. Xue Ning is...

434
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,680
When Wei Qing gets better,

435
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,230
we'll focus our efforts on helping him.

436
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,710
Don't mind me.

437
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,470
Just look after your Mr. Wei.

438
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,590
I'm leaving Zhou Shi in your care.

439
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,830
Whether or not it works out

440
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,470
is up to you.

441
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,710
Don't worry.

442
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,760
I'll take care of her.

443
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,190
You too. Take care of yourself.

444
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,710
I will.

445
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,230
I'm off.

446
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,430
Just go.

447
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,950
Bye.

448
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,000
Bye-bye.

449
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,230
What am I doing?

450
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,470
Can we talk?

451
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,230
You scared me.

452
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,310
I forgot you are here.

453
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,920
Zhou Shi moved out.

454
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,430
I reckon she won't be coming back soon.

455
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,590
Now you have two spare rooms.

456
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,830
Let me take one.

457
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,400
It's uncomfortable
sleeping in the living room.

458
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,230
You've always liked that spot.

459
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,350
I don't remember.

460
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,760
It doesn't count if I can't remember.

461
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,560
Besides, it's better for you.

462
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,710
What if I got sick and infected you?

463
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,920
When you go to shoot,

464
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,520
you'll be facing the male lead

465
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,230
with snot running...

466
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:51,950
Stop.

467
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,590
Fine.

468
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,560
Miss Brainiac
probably won't be moving back.

469
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,880
You can have her room.

470
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,640
Okay.

471
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,160
Only for the time being.

472
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,710
For the time being.

473
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,520
Yes, only temporary.

474
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,280
Don't move.

475
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,950
Slowly. Come down.

476
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,800
Darling.

477
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,230
Next time you need anything, tell me.

478
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,400
I'll do it. You stay put.

479
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,880
We're not certain I'm pregnant yet.

480
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,920
Even if I am,

481
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,920
people have said

482
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,830
it's fine as long
as it's not rigorous activity.

483
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Aren't you being overly cautious

484
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,640
with the way you're behaving?

485
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,520
Still, it's better to be careful.

486
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,160
What is it you wanted?

487
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,680
The guitar.

488
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,040
Okay.

489
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,590
Darling, why do you want the guitar?

490
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,000
Actually,

491
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,280
the reason I didn't want
to go to the hospital today...

492
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,640
is that

493
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,590
I wanted to reminisce on some things

494
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,040
before I decide to become a mother.

495
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
What are they?

496
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,920
Bi Qiujing.

497
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,110
The name, Bi Qiujing,

498
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,310
does not only mean your wife.

499
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,710
It also represents your youth, right?

500
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,920
Did you speak to Rachel?

501
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,190
I'm sorry.

502
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,560
Because of my curiosity,

503
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,760
I looked into it.

504
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,430
Darling.

505
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,830
I should be the one to say sorry.

506
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,350
I always thought

507
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,110
you couldn't care less
about such matters.

508
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,190
That's why I didn't explain it to you.

509
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,880
When I interviewed her,

510
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,230
it was because
I was attracted to her name.

511
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,230
Because

512
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,590
I wanted to find out what someone

513
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,430
who shares your name is like.

514
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,710
I later realized

515
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
she fit the criteria we set.

516
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,520
That's why I hired her.

517
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,350
As for the things
that happened between us,

518
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,280
I didn't remember any of it.

519
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,680
I only realized after she told me.

520
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,560
Between her and me,

521
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,760
the two Bi Qiujings,

522
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,230
who is the cause

523
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,070
and who is the effect?

524
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,520
Darling.

525
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,350
Yes, the guitar represents my youth.

526
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,430
But not Bi Qiujing.

527
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,800
In my heart,

528
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,190
the only Bi Qiujing that matters to me

529
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,640
is the person
I'm going to spend my life with.

530
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,520
You're the cause of everything.

531
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,520
You're the effect of everything.

532
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,599
♪I yearn for us♪

533
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,959
♪But I didn't know
it was the "us" she mentioned♪

534
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,639
♪I yearn for us♪

535
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,999
♪I've only been the only one
taking things seriously♪

536
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,679
♪I yearn for us♪

537
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:38,479
♪If it wasn't for you who assured me♪

538
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,519
♪Fine. I'll trust you♪

539
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,470
This painting has been there

540
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,950
ever since you left the country.

541
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,160
Whenever I miss you,

542
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,040
I'll take a seat here.

543
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,520
The bed was freshly made.

544
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,040
If you need anything else,
I'll buy it for you.

545
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,880
I don't need anything.

546
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,830
I brought my stuff.

547
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,070
Wash up and sleep early.

548
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,190
You had a long day.

549
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,000
You too.

550
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,190
Good night.

551
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,880
Good night.

552
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,590
Wei Qing.

553
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,110
I'll be here from now on.

554
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,590
So stop thinking too much.

555
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,000
Okay.

556
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,640
I won't.

557
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,880
The contract is fine.

558
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,230
You can send them to the artists.

559
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,400
Remember to follow up.

560
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,710
Okay, Ms. Zhou.

561
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,560
By the way, your phone rang many times

562
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,160
while you were in the meeting.

563
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,070
Okay. Thanks.

564
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,110
You go ahead.

565
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:13,925
(13 Missed Calls)

566
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,880
Why did you only call me now?

567
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,950
I called you dozens of times.

568
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,070
I was in a meeting
and I didn't have my phone.

569
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,920
What is it?

570
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,880
Nothing. I just miss you.

571
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,190
I miss you too.

572
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,070
I've made lunch. It's in the fridge.

573
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,070
Remember to eat.

574
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,470
But

575
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,950
I miss you so much
that I've lost my appetite.

576
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,710
Be good.

577
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,000
Eat your meal.

578
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,520
I'll get home earlier today.

579
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,760
You remember to eat your meal too.

580
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,590
Okay, I'm hanging up.

581
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,800
Bye-bye.

582
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,760
Hold on.

583
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,430
I can't let him be alone.

584
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Mingcheng.

585
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,400
Mr. Wei.

586
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,400
Why are you here? Come in.

587
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,310
Shishi called me.

588
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,110
She's worried about you
being home alone.

589
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,310
So she asked me to come to see you.

590
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,310
How about your wife?
Has she done the checkup?

591
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Not yet.

592
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,760
She went to school.

593
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,110
She has a lot of things to do there.

594
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,280
She'll get the checkup
after things are settled.

595
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,190
Any progress with my assignment?

596
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,310
It's going well.

597
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,430
They basically agreed
to sign the agreement.

598
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,470
I suppose they trust you more.

599
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,110
From now on,

600
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,000
you don't have to urge them anymore.

601
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,000
Give them some room to think it over.

602
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,230
We don't want to make them think

603
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,040
we're desperate, you get me?

604
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,520
Mr. Wei, what...

605
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,640
What are you trying to do?

606
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,680
It's so boring staying at home all day.

607
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,160
So I thought I could learn to cook
and cook for Zhou Shi.

608
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,590
Since you're here,
you can teach me then.

609
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,680
Mr. Wei, cooking isn't something

610
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,400
you can master quickly.

611
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,110
That's not a problem. Starting today,

612
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,590
you'll come here every day to teach me.

613
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,590
Boss, I still have to go to work.

614
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,190
From now on,

615
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,950
this will be your job.

616
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,950
Stop yapping and let's begin.

617
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,590
Okay then. Chop the carrot first.

618
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,520
I expected nothing less of myself.

619
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,710
I oversaw all the cooking.

620
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,230
But this soup, I made personally.

621
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,520
That's worth something, right?

622
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,070
When are you coming home?

623
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
I'm sorry.

624
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,710
I have to work overtime.

625
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,520
- I'll go home as soon as I can.
- Ms. Zhou, the meeting is about to start.

626
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,190
Okay, I'm coming.

627
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,760
I have to go.

628
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,680
Okay.

629
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,070
You're busy at work. I get it.

630
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,110
I'll wait.

631
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,160
I work my butt off the whole day

632
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,430
for a few pennies.

633
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,680
When I get home,
there's no one to greet me.

634
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,430
This won't do.

635
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,800
I have to treat myself better.

636
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,070
You're back.

637
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,190
No late-night shoots today?

638
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,830
What kind of production
shoots at night all the time?

639
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,520
Do you think I'm made of steel?

640
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,070
Your production crew.

641
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,160
Drinking wine?

642
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,110
What? Is that a problem?

643
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,040
I don't have any shoots tomorrow.
I'm going to relax.

644
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,640
It's boring drinking by yourself.

645
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,160
Count me in.

646
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,590
Alright.

647
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,310
I'll let you in on it this time.

648
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,280
You can drink with me.

649
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,400
Just drinking
without finger food is weird.

650
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,190
Wait for me. I'll buy some stuff.

651
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,640
I'm not waiting for you.
I'll drink first.

652
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,110
Let the wine aerate first.
I'll be quick.

653
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,710
Well?

654
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,760
Like I said,
you can't beat me at drinking.

655
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,070
Scared now?

656
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,040
Scared?

657
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,070
Growing up, I, Lin Feifei,

658
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,110
have never been scared of anyone.

659
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,950
But now there's someone.

660
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,920
Who is it?

661
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,560
You.

662
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,920
You're scared of me?

663
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,680
Why didn't I feel it at all?

664
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,470
I'm scared you might never remember me.

665
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,040
We went through so much together.

666
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,230
It's like being in a coffin,

667
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,880
unable to get out.

668
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,950
I'll help you out.

669
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,710
I'm not leaving.

670
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,680
Don't touch me.

671
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,520
You don't get it.

672
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,590
Those memories mean a lot to me.

673
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,430
I didn't know in the past.

674
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,520

00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,710
Did he say

777
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,630
he made the soup himself?

778
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,560
Hey.

779
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,710
Why did you suddenly go to your room?

780
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,800
You didn't tell me.

781
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,000

783
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,520

So busy that my mind is blank.

787
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,280
I couldn't pay attention
to anything else.

788
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,080
I failed to consider your feelings.

789
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,630
I'm really sorry.

790
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,910

Are you really mad?

796
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,800
Don't tell me
that pushed him over the edge.

797
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,870
What else?

798
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,630
Anything dangerous has been put away.

799
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,360
Now I have to find a way
to cheer him up.

800
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,320
What are you doing?

801
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,840
The weather forecast said
there will be a thunderstorm tonight.

802
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,390
I'm scared of thunder.

803
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,800

804
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,800
No.

805
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,320

any thunderstorms tonight.

809

810
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,560
I accidentally

811
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,120
wet the bed sheet just now.

812
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,190
I can't sleep on it tonight.

813
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,040
You can't expect me
to sleep on the sofa, right?

814
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,670
There are plenty more bed sheets.

815
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,840
Just change with a new one.

816
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,230
Actually,

817
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:07,600
I really miss you after not seeing you
the whole day.

818
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,710
How about we have a chat?

819
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,520
A man and woman
need to know their boundaries.

820
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,360
You...

821
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,150
(No. I have to be patient.)

822
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,670
(He's unwell.)

823
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,040
I swear.

824
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,040
I won't do anything.

825
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,280
At the most,

826
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,430
I'll just hold your hand.

827
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,870
But...

828
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,560
How could she give up so easily?

829
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,000
I would've agreed if she had pleaded.

830
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,150
That's your side. This is my side.

831
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,190
Whoever crosses the line is a dog.

832
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,000
Are you fine now?

833
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,280

834
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,390

835

837

839
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,600
What is it you did wrong?

840
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,560
I... I shouldn't have stayed
late at work.

841
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,470
I shouldn't have answered so many calls.

842
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,630
Do you think I'm angry
because of your work?

843
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,710
Aren't you?

844
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,320
Why did you lie down again?

845
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,190
Say something.

846
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,560
What did I do wrong?

847
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,320
At least tell me.

848
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,870
I've been coaxing you all day.

849
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,320
Is that going to be your attitude?

850
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,360
So dramatic.

851
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,230
Who coaxes someone
and falls asleep halfway?

852
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,320
You must be exhausted
from working so hard.

853
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,950
What's the point?

854
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,670
Wei Qing?

855
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,150
Wei Qing.

856
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,230
Why are you here and not sleeping?

857
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,360
In this world,

858
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,870
there's nothing
worth looking back on anymore.

859
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,710
I've lost everything.

860
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,000
Goodbye.

861
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:56,910
No!

862
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,040
Wei Qing.

863
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,560
Wei Qing!
