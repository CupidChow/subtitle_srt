00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,080
I remember.

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,360
But I think she has already forgotten it.

49
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,080
(When I saw her again,)

50
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,910

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,240
(She had a serious sequela
after the accident.)

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,000
(No matter how hard
she does her rehabilitation,)

53
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,800
(she can no longer hold a drawing pen)

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
(like before.)

55
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,670
(Even so,)

56
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,240
(she still chose a job
that's closest to paintings.)

57
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,550
(She started from
the most basic job at an art gallery.)

58
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,390
(Step by step,
she became who she is today)

59
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,830
(and is now standing)

60
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,367
(at the closest spot to my sister.)

61
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,800
(She said)

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,160
(half of her effort)

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,470
(was to repay me for saving her life.)

64
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,550
(But I'm the only one who knew)

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,630
(that she was the one who saved me.)

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,550
(That night,)

67
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,360
(she got hurt because of me.)

68
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,080
(I was too weak.)

69
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,910

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,240

71
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,750
Sleep?

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,160
I'll kill...

73
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,030
What's going on?

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,000
What did you do to me?

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,830
You kept mumbling nonsense yesterday.

76
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,830
The doctor gave you a dose of sedative.

77
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,640
The sedative is still in effect.

78
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,070
You better stay still.

79
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,160
Nonsense?

80
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,320
What did I say?

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,830
You didn't say anything much.

82
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,640
You just said your girlfriend dumped you.

83
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,950
What?

84
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,390
I don't get it.

85
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,320
You've been following
Xue Zi for such a long time.

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,550
Why didn't you learn any of her tricks?

87
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,950
You're wasting the Snow Group's name.

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,320
I even said that?

89
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,160
By the way, why do you care so much?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
Why are you coming here?

91
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,510
I am your brother.

92
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:08,880
You were adopted by my father.

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,440
So, we are

94
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,110
actually

95
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,920
brothers who are not related by blood.

96
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,040
You can stay at my place

97
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,880
but you need to follow the rules

98
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,440
and sell me the photos.

99
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,390
Wait.

100
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,640
What do you have
against Zhou Shi's photos?

101
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,000
She is my girlfriend.

102
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,920
I don't care

103
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,640
what happened in the past.

104
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,720
From now on,

105
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,270
I hope you'll realize the truth

106
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,600
and stop annoying me.

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,950
No way.

108
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,760
Shut up.

109
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,480
Wei An, let's go.

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
Why is he so angry?

111
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,830
Is this Zhou Shi
who you've missed out on?

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,160
Nice photos.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,670
You should feel happy.

114
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,950
At least,

115
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,800
Zhou Shi left you
because she had difficulties.

116
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,920
It wasn't because of a new lover.

117
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,920
Don't feel burdened.

118
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,550
You weren't by her side

119
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,670
when she got hurt.

120
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,110
It wasn't your fault.

121
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Is that so?

122
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,000
What have I done
in the past two years then?

123
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,040
Weren't you finding out
news about her in secret?

124
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
If I were to

125
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,920
trust her more in the past,

126
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,270
I would've gone to find her myself.

127
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,000
It's still not too late to do that.

128
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,670
(Mr. Wei.)

129
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,920
Mr. Wei.

130
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,320
When are you going to stop hugging me?

131
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,790
I almost can't breathe.

132
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,830
You said you don't want it to end.

133
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,110
Do you mean it literally?

134
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,720
What else?

135
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,270
What else can I mean?

136
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,790
In certain situations,

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,510
it can also mean

138
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,320
don't

139
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,040
stop.

140
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,790
Do you think I'm here
to take advantage of you?

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,640
Doing something special
after we've already broken up.

142
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,440
This is no different
from tricking you into sex.

143
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,640
Am I

144
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,200
that vulgar to you?

145
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,350
Even so,

146
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,110
I didn't plan to
let you take advantage of me.

147
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,320
Do you think I wear this

148
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,390
for your convenience?

149
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,880
What else?

150
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,510
Of course, not. What are you thinking?

151
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,160
I got coffee spilt on me

152
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,790
so I got someone to wash my dress.

153
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,320
You came in before I had time to change.

154
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,790
I don't believe that.

155
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,640
That's too much of a coincidence.

156
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,760
Miss Zhou. Your dress is cleaned.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,070
What about now?

158
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,830
I guess you passed.

159
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
But

160
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,070
how do you explain this?

161
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,510
Why do you

162
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,670
put on lipstick after you shower?

163
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,790
I bought a new lipstick.

164
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,510
I'm trying out to see its colour.

165
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,790
Don't tell me

166
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,040
you think

167
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,320
I was seducing you, Mr. Wei.

168
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,880
Who told you to say something like that?

169
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,760
Two days ago,
you said we were just pretending.

170
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,600
Then, you regret it today.

171
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,550
I did that

172
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,920
because I wanted you to give up.

173
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,890
Who knew that a CEO

174
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,910
would not give up on his ex-girlfriend.

175
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,230
If I win,

176
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,200
will you keep your promise?

177
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,710
We'll go back to being colleagues.

178
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,030
What's so hard about that?

179
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,350
However,

180
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,110
it looks like

181
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
my win is already a guarantee.

182
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,960
I only have one card in my hand.

183
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,200
The joker is with you.

184
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
How about this? I'll give you a chance.

185
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,200
If I draw the joker this time,

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,350
it'll be your win. How's that?

187
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,640
Sure.

188
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
I'm pregnant.

189
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,670
Yes! Game over.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,640
You cheated.

191
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,710
You didn't say it's not allowed.

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,670
How could you

193
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,790
simply say that you're pregnant?

194
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,840
Are you?

195
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,350
Of course, not.

196
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,590
I win.

197
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,350
Honour your loss, Mr. Wei.

198
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,840
You're leaving again?

199
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,230
Don't leave.

200
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm telling you.

201
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,350
We are only colleagues. Remember that.

202
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,280
What a cruel girl you are.

203
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,590
You escaped so quickly.

204
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,880
You liar!

205
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,280
Rachel.

206
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,400
Sit down.

207
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,790
Rachel, let me ask you something.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,280
Who is the one who arranges

209
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,790
our company's plants?

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,030
I think it's Sunny.

211
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,840
But Ada is responsible

212
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,110
for the flowers in Mr. Li's office.

213
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,470
She thinks it's too slow
to change them every week.

214
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,710
The flowers in Mr. Li's office
are changed every day.

215
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,150
Why do you think she did so much?

216
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I think

217
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,790
she is hoping for Mr. Li
who has been ignored by his wife

218
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,350
to think of her one day.

219
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,350
Ignored?

220
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,200
Who is ignoring whom?

221
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Lower your voice.

222
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,440
Let me tell you.

223
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,910
Who else do you think?

224
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,200
It's Mr. Li, of course.

225
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,760
He might have a wife.

226
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
But his life

227
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,350
is worse than someone single.

228
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,520
Let me tell you.

229
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,150
I've seen the dry cleaning
label on his suit

230
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,760
more than once.

231
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,007
Also, his tie

232
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,550
might be custom-made,

233
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,280
but he only has one of them.

234
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,520
You can say that he prioritizes efficiency

235
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,840
and doesn't care about all that,

236
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,840
but

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,710
his wife needs to be caring at least.

238
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Let me tell you.

239
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,550
Whether a man has a woman
to take care of him or not

240
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,320
is obvious to see.

241
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,840
Take care?

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,640
I'm hungry.

243
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,440
I know. Let's eat.

244
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,760
(Oh, no.)

245
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,280
(Why do I feel like
he's always taking care of me?)

246
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,030
Even so,

247
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,280
He is still very happy every day.

248
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,670
Tell me.

249
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,440
How pretty is his wife

250
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,880
for him to be so loyal to her?

251
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,470
What if

252
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,640
she's not pretty?

253
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
That's impossible.

254
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,710
Lu, you know nothing.

255
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Do you know how many people
from our company want to meet her?

256
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,640
Also,

257
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,840
a group of people is asking
me for her phone number.

258
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,910
Wait.

259
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
My name is not Lu. I am...

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,320
You are not Lu?

261
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,080
Why are you laughing?

262
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,790
Did you receive a funny message?

263
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
It's quite funny.

264
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,200
Oh.

265
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,960
Did you say

266
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,910
that many people are asking you
for Mr. Li's wife's number?

267
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,400
That's right.

268
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,790
Looks like

269
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,280
this game will come to an end soon.

270
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,080
Rachel.

271
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,280
Help me.

272
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,790
You scared me.

273
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,550
What are you doing?

274
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,400
Hello, Manager.

275
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,280
Why are you here?

276
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,670
No one's here.

277
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,590
I have something to tell you
since no one's around at lunch break.

278
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,760
Why can't we talk outside?

279
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,880
It's not so convenient.

280
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,280
How so?

281
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,400
It's about Mr. Li.

282
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,440
What is it?

283
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,710
Just now,

284
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,790
I met his wife.

285
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,840
When?

286
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
When? Did she come here?

287
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,400
She came

288
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,150
when all of you went out for lunch.

289
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,080
She pulled me outside

290
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,910
and scolded me

291
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,520
because she said
I was seducing her husband.

292
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,710
That's impossible.

293
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,910
Why did she scold you for no reason?

294
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,710
Because of this.

295
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,200
This...

296
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,790
He wanted to ask me something

297
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,440
at the KTV that day.

298
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,590
Someone actually took a picture of us

299
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,520
and send it to his wife.

300
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,230
Let me take another look.

301
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,110
His wife is quite sharp-eyed.

302
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,080
I can't even recognize you.

303
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,080
It's not the picture.

304
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,470
It's the smell.

305
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,030
His wife said

306
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,790
he has a Mozzie Buster smell

307
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,320
on him recently.

308
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,400
That plant is only on my table

309
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,840
in the whole office.

310
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,350
How can I explain that?

311
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,760
After all, it did look suspicious.

312
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,110
But I think both of you

313
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,080
shouldn't meet in secret after all.

314
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,080
But don't you think
the person who took this picture

315
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,320
is more despicable?

316
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,470
This person took the picture, sent it

317
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,910
and didn't make it clear.

318
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,640
This person wants her
to come and make a ruckus in the office.

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,670
This person is so despicable.

320
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,150
I must find her.

321
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,910
Have you found any clues?

322
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
What is it?

323
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,320
Shoes.

324
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,080
I heard someone at the KTV

325
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,280
and chased after that person.

326
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,000
I didn't see that person

327
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,670
but I heard obvious sounds
of high heel shoes

328
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,320
at the corner of the corridor.

329
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,470
They are heels

330
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,760
that are at least six centimetres and above.

331
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,280
Oh, it's similar to
the ones you're wearing now.

332
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,790
Nonsense.

333
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
How can you use that as evidence?

334
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,230
Did the cameras get any footage?

335
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,520
Not really.

336
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,200
The cameras were only decorations.

337
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,230
But I believe one place

338
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,590
got it.

339
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,470
What place is it?

340
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,880
To go to the KTV room,

341
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,320
that person would need to
pass through the KTV's store.

342
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,280
That camera is always on

343
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,350
for 24 hours with no blind spots.

344
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,150
Mr. Li's wife

345
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,960
should already be at the KTV.

346
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,960
Oh. She promised me

347
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,280
to find the person
who had taken that picture.

348
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,760
She said she would call
the person who reported me

349
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,710
at 1:00 p.m. today.

350
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,470
It's almost 1:00 p.m. now.

351
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,790
It's you, indeed.

352
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Impossible. I've always been using

353
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,670
internet phones.

354
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,230
Sweet Scented Geranium.

355
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,350
Also known as Mozzie Buster.

356
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,280
You put such a heavily-scented plant

357
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,880
in Li Mingcheng's office

358
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,350
just to attract his wife

359
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,830
to this smell.

360
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,800
It'll be easy for you to accuse me.

361
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,800
Yes. You tricked me.

362
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,880
You are right.

363
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,040
I took the picture. So what?

364
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,110
I took that picture because you were indecent.

365
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,230
Did you only do it once?

366
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,230
You've taken pictures
of her husband many times, right?

367
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,040
You...

368
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,640
Did you do it to make a report as well?

369
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,760
What did you say?
I dare you to say it again.

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,520
I know you won't admit it.

371
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,230
Let me pass a message
from his wife to you.

372
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,640
Liking someone is not illegal.

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,280
But only a thief tries to steal
someone else's possession.

374
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,800
One day as a thief, forever a thief.

375
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,920
Even if you get what you want,

376
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,520
your intentions are already impure.

377
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Why bother?

378
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,760
Nonsense!

379
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,640
My jigsaw puzzle.

380
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,350
What's going on with you two?

381
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,640
Ask her.

382
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I just used my sub-account

383
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,920
to call her.

384
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,800
Why is she so angry?

385
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,040
Don't you think she'll be angry

386
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,190
since the cat's out of the bag?

387
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,520
I don't understand what you say anyway.

388
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,470
This is Mr. Li's favourite jigsaw puzzle.

389
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
I've been doing it for a long time.

390
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,590
Let me help you.

391
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,560
No.

392
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,310
There are more than 1,000 pieces.

393
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll complete it at the warehouse.

394
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,590
This is not a nursery.

395
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,280
Go back if you want to play.

396
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,590
Haven't I got played
by the both of you last night?

397
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,590
You and Wei Qing worked together

398
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,160
and made me...

399
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,070
That's normal hypnosis.

400
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,430
Just a quick word,
hypnosis doesn't rely on one's eyes.

401
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
It's no use wearing a pair of sunglasses.

402
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,800
Besides, it's better to have a good sleep

403
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,710
with your current condition.

404
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,760
What's so good about it?

405
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,590
My brain is empty anyway.

406
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,230
I can't remember the past.

407
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,590
There's no difference from when I'm awake.

408
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,070
What if you happened to dream of it?

409
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,160
It's hard to say
when it comes to one's subconscious.

410
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,880
If you wake up one day

411
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,400
and remember everything,

412
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,350
what will you do?

413
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,160
I don't want that.

414
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,230
Why?

415
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,920
Because I was too useless.

416
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,310
(One can only
protect the people around him)

417
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,640
(when he becomes strong.)

418
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,800
Have you heard of this saying?

419
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,280
If a person always lives in the past,

420
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,520
he will never reach the future.

421
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,800
No matter how much
you hate your past self,

422
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,230
it's once existed

423
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,190
and is affecting your current self.

424
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,110
No.

425
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,110
Don't be quick to deny it.

426
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,520
Have you ever tried

427
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
to understand your past self?

428
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,110
Your complete memory

429
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,110
is only from the past two years, right?

430
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,070
If you want to become a complete self

431
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,310
(and be recognized,)

432
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,160
(why don't you try)

433
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,560
(accepting your past self?)

434
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,710
(Maybe you'll realize that your past self)

435
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,800
(isn't as bad as you think)

436
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,560
(if you come in touch with it.)

437
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
(Some people are still worth getting back)

438
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,760
(and being cherished.)

439
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,070
(Why don't you try to start again?)

440
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:13,975
(Ambassador: Lin Feifei)

441
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,590
(Why don't I try to find my memory?)

442
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,350
So, what is his situation now?

443
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,160
It's just as you expect.

444
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,470
He might look vicious

445
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,040
but that lad

446
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,470
has been feeling confused.

447
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,560
I also have a question for you.

448
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,070
I hope you don't think it's too sudden.

449
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,760
We've known each other
for more than 10 years.

450
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,310
There's no need to
beat around the bush with me.

451
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,230
Say it.

452
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,920
If I date my ex-girlfriend,

453
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,640
do you think we will get back together?

454
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,230
She hung up?

455
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,520
Did something happen
between you and Shishi?

456
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,040
I do want something to happen.

457
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,350
Forget it.

458
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,640
You're eating alone here.

459
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
So lonely.

460
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,830
You have someone at the office now?

461
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,950
Yes.

462
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,880
Does my wife count?

463
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,310
Bi Qiujing is working there?

464
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,160
Why?

465
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,470
Because she wants to have lunch with me,

466
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,110
have dinner with me,
work overtime with me,

467
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,190
welcome a new day at the office

468
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,680
and drink a cup of coffee together.

469
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,830
You make me cringe.

470
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,520
If you envy me,

471
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,560
find yourself a person

472
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,310
who is willing to
spend eight hours with you.

473
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,640
Didn't you say

474
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,070
you wanted to get back with her?

475
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,470
After you got married,

476
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,680
(Darling)
you are getting more and more...

477
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,190
Darling.

478
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay.

479
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,190
It's fine. Go ahead.

480
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,680
Your colleague is more important.

481
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,590
Bye.

482
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,830
Looks like

483
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,760
being with other people are more important

484
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,560
than having lunch with you.

485
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,280
Mr. Wei.

486
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,950
There is actually

487
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,110
another explanation for that.

488
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,680
That person

489
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,350
does not want to get back
together with you at all.

490
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,830
Don't just drink.

491
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,640
Eat.

492
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,000
Don't waste it.

493
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,800
Why are you here?

494
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,640
Where's my puzzle?

495
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,710
The puzzle...

496
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,560
It's done?

497
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,284
So fast?

498
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,350
It only took you a lunch break.

499
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,710
As expected of Lu.

500
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,000
-I'll hang it up later.
-Hold on.

501
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,280
Won't you ask how I complete it?

502
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,830
No.

503
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,400
Mr. Li is coming back soon.
I need to take it back immediately.

504
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,110
Take it back? What next?

505
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,880
Which side of you
do you want to show him?

506
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,310
I actually suspected you

507
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,640
right from the start.

508
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,430
Taking candid pictures requires skill.

509
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,830
You can't take good pictures

510
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,070
with good reflexes.

511
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,110
Rachel.

512
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,350
(Your body is weak
but you have strong arms.)

513
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,520
(Due to compositing photographs
for a long time,)

514
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,710
(you have)

515
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,590
(a near-perfect obsession
with the golden ratio.)

516
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,470
If Ada didn't do that,

517
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,470
I could have concluded that it was you.

518
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,560
What do you mean?

519
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,400
I'm stupid.

520
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,560
I don't understand.

521
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,920
God's Candid Diary

522
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,310
is an album I accidentally found.

523
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,590
That album has a specific cover.

524
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,230
You dare put

525
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,280
this picture in front of Li Mingcheng.

526
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,350
Should I say that you're ambitious

527
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,920
or infatuated?

528
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,400
It creeps me out.

529
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,430
Enough.

530
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,830
Enough.

531
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,640
Let me tell you one more thing.

532
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,280
Li Mingcheng's wife

533
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,520
is me.

534
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,950
You have my number.

535
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,640
Try calling me.

536
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,280
Now, you should...

537
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,780
(The parcel is at the door,
please check it timely.)

538
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,880
A parcel?

539
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,400
This face is amazing.

540
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,400
I came to play with you.

541
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,000
Brat!

542
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,520
Delete my picture!

543
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,710
I won't do it anymore, come on.

544
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,710
Tell me. Why are you here?

545
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,880
I was just passing by.

546
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,470
Passing by?

547
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,830
I didn't tell you where my house is.

548
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
How did you find this place?

549
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,520
I found out

550
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,590
by asking people around you.

551
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,000
You are a star after all.

552
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,160
I'm warning you.

553
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,110
Don't harm the girls at my company.

554
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,470
I'll harm you then.

555
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,880
All right?

556
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,680
You were the one who said
you'll always care about me.

557
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,280
Do you remember?

558
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,880
Forget it.

559
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,350
I thought you didn't want my care.

560
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,520
You ran faster than a rabbit
when you saw me.

561
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,110
Things are different now.

562
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,310
You are not my type.

563
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
But

564
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,350
you are quite pretty.

565
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,000
Perhaps

566
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,190
I'll fall in love with you at the first sight.

567
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,160
Forget it.

568
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,560
You weren't interested in me in the past.

569
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,950
I know.

570
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,800
You must have seduced
my pure self from the past.

571
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,350
That is how you discovered a new world.

572
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,400
Do I look like someone who has no shame?

573
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
You were still a student
before I broke up with you.

574
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,760
How could I do that?

575
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,710
Why are you looking at me like that?

576
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,470
Nothing. I just think it's a pity.

577
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,800
Now,

578
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,040
I won't even let you think.

579
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,950
What do you mean?

580
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,560
Hey, I'm almost 22 years old.

581
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,920
If I want to,

582
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,950
we can get married immediately.

583
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,160
This is my biggest difference now

584
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,590
compared to the past.

585
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,350
Stop pretending to be an adult.

586
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,800
Brat.

587
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,710
What did you do in the last two years
when I wasn't around?

588
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,640
Just...

589
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,040
This house is really...

590
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,640
What's this place?

591
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,520
Don't simply run around.

592
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,430
Not bad.

593
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,430
Brat, what are you...

594
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,560
Don't come here!

595
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,400
Fei?

596
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,470
You...

597
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,680
Have you remembered everything?

598
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,190
Thanks for the waiting.

599
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,520
Having enough fun?

600
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,950
I got found out.

601
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,430
When did you find out?

602
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,110
In the past, you would've kissed me

603
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,800
without thinking about the consequences.

604
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,190
Only a shameless person

605
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,160
can keep this

606
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,310
cringey act going.

607
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:20,830
Tell me honestly.

608
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,000
Did you almost believe it just now?

609
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,640
In that case,

610
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,280
let's go along with it then.

611
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,230
What do you mean?

612
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,560
Why don't you

613
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,880
start all over with me again?

614
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,680
You can think of me
as Ning Fei from the past.

615
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
It's fine.

616
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,070
I am him anyway.

617
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,880
There's no difference to you.

618
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,430
Are you done?

619
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,760
How much did you drink to get so drunk?

620
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,800
You don't remember who I am.

621
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,830
Why should I

622
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,310
treat you equally?

623
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,230
Are you still waiting for me

624
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,590
to remember the past?

625
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,950
Yes. So, what?

626
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Let me tell you.

627
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,710
That day won't come.

628
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,830
Even If I remember,

629
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,950
my feelings towards you have changed.

630
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,830
Is that fine?

631
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,560
Are you done?

632
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,880
That's none of your business.

633
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,950
Go away if you're acting like a pervert.

634
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,000
I won't entertain you!

635
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,760
Fine.

636
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,830
You said it. I'm leaving.

637
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,800
What are you doing?

638
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
It's fine.

639
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,110
It will be fine.

640
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,640
It must be fine.

641
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,400
Definitely.

642

00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,400

Have you informed Mr. Xue?

Yes. Mr. Xue invited him over

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,190
That's basically what happened.

679
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,310
Miss Zhou. It's been a while.

680
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,950
Hello, Mr. An.

681
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,470
Wei An.

682
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,280
Is this your first time meeting her

683
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,190
since she came back?

684
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,070
To be exact, it's not our first time.

685
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,160
If you don't be mindful,

686
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,920
you'll see her again in the hospital.

687
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,830
Miss Zhou. Please continue.

688
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,310
I still have things to do.

689
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,040
Mr. Wei. I'll be leaving.

690
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,560
What's wrong?

691
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,640
Didn't we say
we would only talk about work?

692
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,280
Why won't you let me go?

693
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,230
I'm here to talk about work with you.

694
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,190
There's WeChat, phone and video conference.

695
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,230
Why do you

696
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,830
need to come to my office?

697
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,950
Didn't your superior tell you yet?

698
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,475
(From Neil Snow to Zhou Shi:
Change of Biennial Project person-in-charge)

699
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,800
It's an email from your boss, right?

700
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,840
You are so inefficient.

701
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,390
What's going on?

702
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,520
Isn't Mr. Xue the one

703
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,190
who has been talking to Yunma Group?

704
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:40,800
Why am I the one in charge now?

705
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,840
Is there a problem?

706
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,080
Didn't you communicate a lot
with me previously?

707
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,630
That was temporary support.

708
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,870
My job is to check the displayed contents.

709
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,630
Mr. Wei, do you need to talk to me in person

710
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,630
about issues on the surface
like art selection, theme confirmation

711
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,840
and communicating with artists?

712
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,390
You are the chairperson.

713
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,150
Don't you need to manage your group?

714
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,230
That's none of your concern.

715
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,080
Isn't Yunma Group operating as usual

716
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,230
when there was something wrong with my eyes?

717
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,710
It's all because of
the good subordinates you have.

718
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,560
Wei An alone

719
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,000
is already your core.

720
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,320
There's also Mingcheng
who is in charge of expansion.

721
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,600
How many good deeds
did you do in your past life?

722
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,560
No matter what good karma
I have had in the past,

723
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,360
I still end up in your hands.

724
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,560
You did

725
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,000
the most damage to me.

726
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,600
Are you saying that making you go
head over heels is my fault?

727
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,800
Fine.

728
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,470
Let's focus on our careers
from today onwards.

729
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,870
How?

730
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,080
You, a chairperson of our partner group,

731
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,630
are always coming to our company.

732
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,600
Others might think that
you're trying to become a shareholder.

733
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,080
Did you really...

734
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,150
Now you know

735
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,710
why Xue Le agreed, right?

736
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,950
Rich people can really be...

737
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,950
You're so capricious.

738
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,630
Won't your board of directors stop you?

739
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,280
Yes.

740
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,000
This company
might have a normal brand image,

741
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,630
but it has an effect
that can't be bought with money.

742
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,040
What is it?

743
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
Eight hours of happiness.

744
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,870
Ms. Zhou, I look forward to learning from you.

745
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,950
My pleasure.

746
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,800
It's just I hope you won't regret it.

747
