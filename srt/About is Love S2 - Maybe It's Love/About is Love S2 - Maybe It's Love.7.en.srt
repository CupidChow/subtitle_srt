I placed the bathrobe
on the shelf outside.

You can't see me anyway.

23
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:34,284
What's wrong with him out of a sudden?

24
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:36,724
He seems strange.

25
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:48,484
There are so many messages.

26
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,685
What is he up to?

27
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:06,685

Isn't this a mediocre exhibition? Who cares?

32
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:17,965
Photos taken randomly can be sold.

33
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:20,965
It's so easy to earn
as an artist nowadays.

34
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:22,405
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,444
Do you know how popular these are?

36
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:27,724
This set of black and white portraits is

37
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,644
especially the highlight of this exhibition.

38
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:31,685
There have been people asking
about its price since the first day.

39
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:32,924
It's not for sale.

40
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:34,125
What?

41
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:39,525
I say,

42
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:41,724
I won't sell this portrait

43
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:45,084
no matter how much people pay.

44
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:46,245
How dare you?

45
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:47,325
Who are you?

46
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:55,724
Simply because I'm him.

48
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:58,885
Tell you what.

49
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:01,045
That's my sister in the photo.

50
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,805
If any guy tries to get this portrait,

51
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,084
tell him to see me.

52
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:15,685
Oh dear, why are you wandering around?

53
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,805
The sponsors are looking for you.

54
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:19,644
Why are you wearing this necklace?

55
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:21,045
It's not due to the necklace.

56
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:22,884
Something was wrong with the food I ate.

57
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,965
Are you sure?

58
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:27,125
Mind your words.

59
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:30,525
Later, just insist that there's a problem

60
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:32,805
with the metal in the necklace

61
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:34,125
and that it has nothing to do with us.

62
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:35,685
It's not nice to do that.

63
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:36,685
Of course...

64
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:39,285
Of course, it's not!

65
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:42,405
If they were to pursue liability,

66
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:44,484
your endorsement would be stopped.

67
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:46,204
Just listen to me.

68
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:49,364
Someone will definitely take the blame.

69
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:51,805
Just keep quiet and act like the victim.

70
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,084
Go, hurry up.

73
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:45,364
Have you packed everything?

74
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:48,725
I blew it dry for a while,
I can make do with it.

75
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:51,044
I have something to do.

76
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,604
Mr. Wei, take your time to pack.

77
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:54,044
If there's any problem,

78
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,324
we'll meet again next time.

79
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,924
When is the next time?

80
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,005
Be specific.

81
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,125

82
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,125
No.

84
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:30,484
Mr. Wei, who are you calling?

85
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:36,405
Do I really look like

86
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:39,685
an idiot who will
mistake you for someone else?

87
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:47,484
This lipstick is nice.

88
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,204
It looks good on you.

89
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:53,845
You've learned how to make up

90
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,604
after being abroad for years.

91
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:00,245
Congratulations.

92
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:05,125
Mr. Wei, congratulations
to you for regaining your vision.

93
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:07,364
However, to avoid
getting injured for the second time,

94
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,164
please continue to
cooperate with the treatment.

95
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,285
Who are you to say this to me?

96
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:14,245
Collaborative partner?

97
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:16,204
Fans?

98
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:18,364
Or...

99
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,764
Ex-girlfriend?

100
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:27,644
It's a stranger's suggestion.

101
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:29,364
Mr. Wei, you can choose not to listen to it.

102
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:30,884
A stranger?

103
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:34,644
You're being too dramatic as a stranger.

104
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:36,445
Yes.

105
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:39,245
I remember that you said
something like this in the hospital.

106
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:41,685
I'm probably the friend

107
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:44,005
who made you regret it, right?

108
00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:49,245
Mr. Wei, are you reminiscing?

109
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:51,245
You enjoy seeking attention from me,

110
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:52,725
don't you?

111
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,044
Prodding me doesn't work.

112
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,445
Two years ago, you left suddenly.

113
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:03,805
Now, you take the opportunity

114
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:05,484
and come back out of nowhere.

115
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:08,005
What is your real purpose?

116
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,005
To show sympathy

117
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:15,364
and mercy.

118
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:16,764
If not,

119
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:18,525
you can assume
that I'm doing charity for the blind.

120
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:19,445
Enough!

121
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:29,204
If you don't make things clear today,

122
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:30,884
don't you go out from here.

123

00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,445
I...

171
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,245
I still have something to tell you.

172
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:36,685
You can't stand me up
at a time like this.

173
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:37,885
Perhaps you could

174
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,245
tell me next time.

175
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:42,325
Next time? Again?

176
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,445
Who am I to you?

177
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:45,164
No way.

178
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:47,044
Today, you're not
leaving no matter what.

179
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:00,484
Zhou Shi!

180
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:02,604
Sorry, I'll make it up to you next time.

181
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:04,404
Zhou Shi!

182
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:05,924
Come back, Zhou Shi!

183
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:12,765
You're finally back,

184
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:14,044
Miss Lin.

185
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,085
Sorry,

186
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,445
we took quite some time
to fix the makeup.

187
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:18,245
We'll get ready
for the next outfit right away.

188
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,205
You don't have to.

189
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:22,085
Can the shooting continue

190
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,645
if something's wrong with the model?

191
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,685
The shooting is canceled.

192
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,205
I'm sorry, as a celebrity,

193
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:28,964
I should be more cautious...

194
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,724
Can you put all the blame on the model?

195
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:33,685
It could be your jewelry

196
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,524
that causes skin allergies.

197
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:36,964
The appearance of an actress

198
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:38,484
is so important.

199
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:40,645
We haven't even
discussed your accountability.

200
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:42,524
Sorry.

201
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:45,164
It's our fault to have brought troubles

202
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:46,685
to Miss Lin.

203
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:48,245
Our company has already called

204
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,724
the internal staff to account.

205
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,524
We'll definitely give you
a satisfactory answer.

206
00:12:57,885 --> 00:12:59,085
If I may ask,

207
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:02,245
how will you deal with the staff?

208
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,005
At least, he can't stay on site.

209
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:04,924
However, he said

210
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:06,404
that he would apologize to you in person.

211
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:08,924
According to him, it was because

212
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,964
of his improper diet last week.

213
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:14,484
Miss Lin, I...

214
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:15,604
No.

215
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:16,885
It has nothing to do with him.

216
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:18,245
It's my own problem.

217
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:20,964
Miss Lin.

218
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:22,805
Shut up. Does a celebrity having food allergies

219
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:24,205
have anything to do with a staff like you?

220
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,844
After all, it's because of my gluttony.

221
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:27,284
It has nothing to do with him.

222
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,325
But it was me who bought the meal.

223
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:31,645
Am I someone

224
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,005
whom you can buy a simple meal for?

225
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:35,445
Why don't you check
how much your salary is?

226
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:44,085
Okay, even if you bought it,

227
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:45,805
it was because of
me being inexperienced.

228
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:46,685
I've never eaten

229
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:47,685
the expensive caviar before,

230
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:48,885
which caused the allergy.

231
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:49,685
After all,

232
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:51,284
it's my poor and covetous attitude

233
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:52,524
that gave me this karma.

234
00:13:53,404 --> 00:13:54,484
It has nothing to do with you.

235
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:55,404
Listen to me.

236
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:56,924
It has nothing to do with him.

237
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,284
It's all my fault.

238
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:02,885
This is the first time I have seen

239
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:04,245
a celebrity self-deprecating herself.

240
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:05,484
Listen to me.

241
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:07,885
I'm answerable to this,
there's nothing wrong.

242
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:09,325
Do you want to get into trouble?

243
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:10,685
Am I right,

244
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:12,484
my assistant, Chen?

245
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:14,284
Yes, Mr. Xue.

246
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:16,524
Xue...

247
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:18,325
Why did he call you that?

248
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:19,724
Let me introduce myself again.

249
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:21,205
I'm Xue Le.

250
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:22,885
I know you're Xue Le.

251
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:24,484
My original name is Neil Snow.

252
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,565
I'm the founder of Shangjue Jewelry.

253
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,325
So,

254
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,325
he's your assistant

255
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:37,044
and you're the boss?

256
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:40,645
This...

257
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,765
Well... he said you couldn't
stay onsite anymore...

258
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:48,445
I can't go on-site to supervise,

259
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:50,724
so I can only come back to the office.

260
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:54,245
So you're not just someone
who does product placement, are you?

261
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,524
I'm the investor and producer.

262
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:00,604
So,

263
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:02,205
can I be considered

264
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,565
someone who can afford
to buy you a meal, Miss Lin?

265
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:06,164
Do I need to show my income statement?

266
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:12,044
Hong.

267
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:25,164
Tell me, what do I have below my eyebrow

268
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:26,404
and above my eyelashes?

269
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:27,685
I'm so blind.

270
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:29,164
How come I fail to recognize

271
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:30,685
the producer?

272
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:31,964
What should I do?

273
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,445
That depends on what you did before.

274
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:36,484
Have you done anything
that was too over?

275
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:38,284
Oh, no.

276
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,005
Is there a way to make it up to him?

277
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:41,085
Of course.

278
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:44,205
Unless you get over your ex boldly

279
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,685
and go for this good guy
with all your heart...

280
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:49,125
Do you think I can simply get over him?

281
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:50,085
What's wrong?

282
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:51,445
I met him again.

283
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:53,524
Who?

284
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:54,805
Ning Fei.

285
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:58,125
Can you believe it? That jerk is back.

286
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,524
I even had a big fight with him.

287
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:00,524
I believe it.

288
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,125
He's sleeping right beside me.

289
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,005
What?

290
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,885
It's not the adult type of sleeping.

291
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:06,245
I'm at Ninghai Hospital.

292
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:07,325
Ning Fei...

293
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:09,245
Judging from his look,

294
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:11,645
I'll just call him Ning Fei
for the time being.

295
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,565
His head is injured
and he's still unconscious.

296
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,524
What's going on?

297
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:16,325
Sir,

298
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,885
go to Ninghai Hospital now, quick!

299
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:18,685
Okay.

300
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:19,924
What's going on? Tell me now!

301
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:21,005
Didn't you have a fight?

302
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,404
Why do you care about him?

303
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,724
Skip the nonsense. What happened?

304
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,044
Actually, I'm not too sure either.

305
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:28,645
When I met him,

306
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:30,245
he was already like this.

307
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:32,205
Seriously, I was shocked.

308
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:34,484
Then? Is the injury serious?

309
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:36,164
Let's say

310
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:38,765
he fell from the escalator,

311
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:39,924
the probability

312
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:41,565
of falling on his head and face is the same.

313
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:43,565
His head was injured badly due to the fall

314
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:46,164
but his face was not hurt at all.

315
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,284
Since when

316
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:49,964
did Ning Fei become so narcissistic?

317
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:51,885
Hey, at times like this,

318
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,645
what should you be caring about?

319
00:16:54,085 --> 00:16:55,245
Wait for me, I'll be there shortly.

320
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:56,645
Bye.

321
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,044
Please drive faster.

322
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:06,565
Mr. Wei,

323
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,164
sorry to keep you waiting.

324
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:10,364
When I brought the clothes here,

325
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:12,085
there was no one in the room.

326
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:16,485
She has escaped again.

327
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:18,644
Don't let me meet her again next time.

328
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:19,884
I...

329
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:23,565
No.

330
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,205
I can't bear with
the term "next time" now.

331
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:28,284
Is... Is she Miss Zhou?

332
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:31,644
She's back, right?

333
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:37,644
Did you know this already?

334
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,485
I realized this during
the exhibition in the hotel.

335
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:46,205
You didn't see wrongly last time.

336
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:49,044
The model in the album
is Miss Zhou indeed.

337
00:17:56,164 --> 00:17:57,764
Why didn't you tell me?

338
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,325
I just feel that

339
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:02,244
it's not about meeting
at an early or late time.

340
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,365
Perhaps this is the best timing.

341
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:06,325
Mr. Wei.

342
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,004
You might be able to find the answer

343
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:09,565
to the blank you had these two years

344
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:11,085
in the exhibition.

345
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,150
(Admission ticket)

346
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,284
Today is the last session.

347
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,975
(In My Name:
EXHIBITION OF NEW PHOTOGRAPHERS)

348
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,550
(Exhibitor: Xue Ning)

349
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:42,284
(Xue Ning?)

350
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:43,685
(Who's that?)

351
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,085
(He's a rising photographer.)

352
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,725
(Although it's his first local exhibition,)

353
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:57,244
(the response is quite good,)

354
00:18:57,764 --> 00:18:59,325
(his couple series is especially)

355
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:01,085
(popular among couples.)

356
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:04,004
(I heard that it had become
a famous check-in spot.)

357
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:07,365
(However, this person is mysterious.)

358
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:08,805
(Apart from his name,)

359
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:11,004
(there's no information
about him on the Internet.)

360
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,270
(The distance of becoming lovers)

361
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,920
(SOLD)

362
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,100
(Outpatient Department)

363
00:19:36,404 --> 00:19:38,244
Luckily the other body parts are not injured.

364
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:39,485
Why did you

365
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:40,924
end up like this in just a day?

366
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:46,445
Where's Bi Qiujing?

367
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:07,884
(The owner of this phone is injured.)

368
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:09,565
(Please come to
Ninghai Hospital immediately.)

369
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,404
(He's in Ward 27 at Level six.)

370
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,770
(Girlfriend)

371
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:18,524
Yes, it's me.

372
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:21,284
Come to the lift lobby.

373
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:22,924
I'll wait for you here.

374
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:29,244
Zhou Shi?

375
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,284
It's really you.

376
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:35,605
Qiujing?

377
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,284
Are you the one who informed me to come?

378
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:40,805
As for the phone's owner...

379
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,004
He's injured.

380
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:43,644
Where is he? Take me there.

381
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:45,244
I can bring you there

382
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,164
but before that,

383
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:49,605
I have something to clarify with you.

384
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,220
(Please call my name, Darling.)

385
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:20,124
(Xue Ning.)

386
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:23,565
(What's his relationship with Ning Fei?)

387
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,660
[Entrance]

388
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:45,485
Zhou Shi.

389
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:48,884
What's your relationship with Ning Fei?

390
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:50,605
Why did you ask this?

391
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:51,965
Do you know?

392
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:54,205
When I first got
his phone and tried to unlock it

393
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,725
with a password,

394
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:58,685
Feifei's birthday
appeared in my mind first.

395
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:00,124
I realized that it was wrong.

396
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:01,284
I tried

397
00:22:01,284 --> 00:22:02,805
all the possible numbers about him.

398
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:04,284
None was correct

399
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,565
(Typing the password)
until I keyed in your birthday.

400
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:09,524
Zhou Shi.

401
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:11,524
These two years, when you were away,

402
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:13,164
Ning Fei was also nowhere to be found.

403
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,445
I checked the IP address

404
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:16,124
which you used when you were last online.

405
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,445
It was a public hospital
near your school.

406
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,004
Then, I checked the news

407
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:21,524
about an Ethnic Chinese student
being a victim nearby.

408
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:23,244
Is your breakup with Wei Qing

409
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:25,524
related to this?

410
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:27,605
Why are you

411
00:22:29,004 --> 00:22:30,244
asking this question now?

412
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:31,644
At first, I didn't link

413
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:33,244
you and Ning Fei together.

414
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:35,164
However, when I saw

415
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:37,164
the countless photos he took with you

416
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:39,325
in these two years...

417
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:40,524
Zhou Shi.

418
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:42,764
Be honest with me.

419
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:44,524
Are you in love

420
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:46,244
with Ning Fei's clone?

421
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:47,805
Is that why you broke up with Wei Qing?

422
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,205
Or is it because you
underwent an astral projection

423
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:51,764
and fell in love
with Ning Fei who experienced

424
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:52,565
the same thing?

425
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,124
Now you're finally back in your own body

426
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:55,205
and remember everything.

427
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:56,924
Or were you brainwashed by someone?

428
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:58,205
Stop!

429
00:22:58,845 --> 00:22:59,605
Wait.

430
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:01,044
Why are

431
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:02,725
your deductions so far from reality?

432
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,004
Normally, people would
probably say that I poached

433
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:06,365
my best friend's boyfriend,

434
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,445
wouldn't they?

435
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:08,565
What nonsense are you saying?

436
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:10,565
It's impossible for you to do that.

437
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,725
What's wrong?

438
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:16,805
Did I say something wrong?

439
00:23:17,524 --> 00:23:18,445
No.

440
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:20,485
Thank you, Qiujing.

441
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:22,605
You don't know how scared I was.

442
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:26,124
I'm really not good at explaining.

443
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:27,524
Don't worry.

444
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:29,845
No matter what you tell me next,

445
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:32,524
I'll trust you.

446
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:34,605
But before that,

447
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:36,365
you should at least tell me

448
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:38,605
what happened two years ago.

449
00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:53,205
(Why is she here?)

450
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:55,524
(This is a hospital.)

451
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:59,004
(So, it's her who sent me here?)

452
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:26,485
Why did you touch my face?

453
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:28,085
Who wants to touch you?

454
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:29,284
I'm already kind enough

455
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:31,044
for not reporting to the police
about you pushing me down the stairs.

456
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:33,485
What? Did I push you down the stairs?

457
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:34,965
Don't play dumb.

458
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:36,644
There have been
many women who fought with me,

459
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:38,884
but you're the very first one

460
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:40,805
who is so merciless.

461
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:44,764
I'd rather be slapped a few more times.

462
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:47,445
Unfortunately, it's my head that's injured.

463
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:48,524
Wait.

464
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:51,685
You said someone
pushed you down the stairs.

465
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,404
Didn't you fall off yourself?

466
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:56,124
Do you think I staged this

467
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:57,924
and faked the fall?

468
00:24:58,485 --> 00:24:59,404
Wait.

469
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:01,805
It wasn't you?

470
00:25:05,725 --> 00:25:07,965
What bad luck I have.

471
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:10,365
Who hates me so much?

472
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:12,445
Who knows?

473
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:13,884
Aren't there many women

474
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:15,565
who fought with you?

475
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:17,284
I get to cut my losses early

476
00:25:17,404 --> 00:25:18,605
but I can't stop those blind ones.

477
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:19,764
Hey.

478
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:21,965
What's wrong with you?

479
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:23,124
You have a sharp tongue.

480
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:23,965
I...

481
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:30,965
You look quite energetic.

482
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:32,404
Anyway, you won't die.

483
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:35,685
By the way, my friend sent you here.

484
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:36,764
Remember to thank her.

485
00:25:36,924 --> 00:25:38,244
I'm not going to stay here.

486
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:40,004
What?

487
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:40,965
Take me to the washroom.

488
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:41,965
Get off!

489
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:50,685
Going to the washroom
requires so much energy.

490
00:25:57,965 --> 00:25:58,965
I'm leaving.

491
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:01,485
What is it again?

492
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:02,485
I'm anxious.

493
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:05,884
How come I didn't feel
that you were so clingy before?

494
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:09,404
Why did I fall in love
with you last time?

495
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:10,845
Don't look for trouble at night.

496
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:13,044
You're the one who keeps
talking about the past.

497
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:15,524
I don't even remember
what happened in the past.

498
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:18,004
Not again.

499
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:21,124
Just break up if you want to.
Don't pretend to have amnesia.

500
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:22,244
No matter how much you hate me,

501
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:24,004
you don't have to
write off the past, do you?

502
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:27,164
I'm not pretending.

503
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:29,764
I really have amnesia.

504
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,445
I bet you won't believe it.

505
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:35,605
Forget it.

506
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:41,725
What do you mean?

507
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:42,725
Shut up.

508
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:51,524
(Did he really forget everything?)

509
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:54,404
Due to the sequela of the operation,

510
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,404
he only has the memory
of these two years.

511
00:26:57,404 --> 00:26:59,044
Ever since that incident,

512
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,884
I tried every method
to make him remember the past,

513
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,805
but the doctor advised
that there shouldn't be

514
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:05,325
any manual intervention
in these two years.

515
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:07,164
It's best that we wait
till his condition turns better.

516
00:27:07,404 --> 00:27:08,565
What about himself?

517
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:09,565
Hadn't he asked you

518
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:11,085
anything about
what happened two years ago?

519
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:13,404
It's probably because of that incident.

520
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:16,205
He doesn't like his past self.

521
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,284
When he has this current name,

522
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:20,884
he's even more focused on who he is now.

523
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:23,445
Looking at his effort,

524
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:25,644
I find it hard to tell him.

525
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:26,685
However,

526
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:28,524
this is unfair to Feifei.

527
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:30,164
She's been waiting for a long time

528
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:31,685
for Fei to come back.

529
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,244
Indeed, that's why I brought him back here,

530
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,124
hoping that he could
recall the memory himself.

531
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,284
What if...

532
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,524
I mean what if...

533
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:43,605
What if he couldn't
recognize Feifei anymore?

534
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:44,845
What would you do?

535
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:49,205
I have to return him to Feifei one day.

536
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:51,284
He can't rely on me too much.

537
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:55,485
To me, he's just Feifei's boyfriend.

538
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,164
I'm just taking care of him on her behalf.

539
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:58,365
I see.

540
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:00,244
So you're treating me like an object.

541
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:01,365
Ning.

542
00:28:02,485 --> 00:28:03,445
What's going on?

543
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:04,445
Shut up.

544
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,284
So, you treated me well

545
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:09,965
and followed everything I said.

546
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:11,845
Is this all because

547
00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:13,605
you're just taking care
of your best friend's boyfriend?

548
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:20,644
What do the two years mean to you?

549
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:22,845
Now, you're pushing me

550
00:28:22,924 --> 00:28:24,004
to a stranger.

551
00:28:24,124 --> 00:28:26,044
You've been the closest person to me!

552
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:27,244
Ning.

553
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:30,085
You're equally important to me.

554
00:28:30,764 --> 00:28:33,644
Who are you to treat me like this?

555
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:34,725
Calm down.

556
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:35,605
Go!

557
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:46,004
Ning!

558
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:49,924
Let Feifei handle the rest.

559
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:51,524
After all, no one

560
00:28:51,524 --> 00:28:53,284
can tame a wild cat better than her.

561
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:06,445
Are you crazy to die
in the middle of the road?

562
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:07,845
Who wants to die?

563
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:11,164
Hey, did you watch too many dramas?

564
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:18,965
Good to hear that.

565
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:21,565
Your head is injured.

566
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:22,445
Why did you come out?

567
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:23,924
You're controlling a lot.

568
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:28,365
Fine, I'll believe that you have amnesia

569
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:29,764
and you can't be blamed,

570
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:31,565
but from now on,

571
00:29:32,244 --> 00:29:33,565
I'm in control.

572
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:36,924
Let's go, come home with me!

573
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:39,085
Go? Where do I go?

574
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:40,284
Do you know what my name is?

575
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,565
Who are you to control so much?

576
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,325
It's okay.

577
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:50,325
Tell me your current name.

578
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:53,124
We shall get to know each other again.

579
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:54,845
(In the future,)

580
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:56,965
let's get along well with each other.

581
00:29:58,404 --> 00:29:59,284
Ning.

582
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:01,445
No matter whether
you regain your memory,

583
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,965
I'll always be by your side.

584
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,845
Not again.

585
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:09,884
Are you done?

586
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,164
Do you think I'll still fall for it?

587
00:30:19,044 --> 00:30:20,805
Where are you going at such a late hour?

588
00:30:21,164 --> 00:30:22,365
I'll go wherever I want.

589
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:23,805
It's none of your business!

590
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,470
([Document. Causes and Effects
with A Lot of Information, Beware.m4a)

591
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,000
(Exhibiter: Xue Ning)

592
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:43,845
Do you know where he is?

593
00:30:44,124 --> 00:30:44,884
Well...

594
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:46,365
I've only seen him once.

595
00:30:46,524 --> 00:30:47,644
How does he look?

596
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:49,805
A handsome guy who looks quite attractive.

597
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:51,524
His personality is rather strange

598
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,685
but it's something that girls like.

599
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:56,884
What about comparing him with me?

600
00:30:58,205 --> 00:30:59,605
It's hard to compare, Mr. Wei.

601
00:30:59,884 --> 00:31:02,524
As a guy, I can't compare this.

602
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:04,485
Forget it.

603
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:06,485
I have his number.

604
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:09,244
Do you want to
call him and ask yourself?

605
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:26,445
You're back.

606
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:31,044
Did you find him?

607
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,685
Don't talk about it.

608
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,205
I went to all the places

609
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:35,445
you wrote on the list.

610
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:37,085
I saw nothing.

611
00:31:37,924 --> 00:31:39,445
What a brat.

612
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:43,685
Did Zhou Shi come?

613
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,764
She's been here
after coming back from the hospital.

614
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:50,244
It's good that she has left,
otherwise, it's awkward.

615
00:31:50,445 --> 00:31:51,685
There's so little information

616
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:53,965
and you can't even get them right in a night.

617
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:57,044
Hey, how could that be so easy?

618
00:31:57,365 --> 00:31:58,325
Getting injured,

619
00:31:58,605 --> 00:32:00,404
losing contact and memory after a breakup.

620
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,044
If there were such scenes in dramas,

621
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:04,004
I would send a knife to the screenwriter.

622
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:06,284
That's so ridiculous!

623
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:07,565
I heard that in one's lifetime,

624
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:08,565
there are three chances
to become rich suddenly

625
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:09,685
and once to be dramatic.

626
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:11,205
How do you feel now?

627
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:12,924
I'm angry!

628
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,244
Are you that agitated?

629
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:15,365
Of course.

630
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:17,644
How much does Xue Zi hate me?

631
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:18,445
She'd rather

632
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:19,924
separate Zhou Shi and Wei Qing

633
00:32:20,044 --> 00:32:21,445
to put Zhou Shi and Fei together.

634
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:22,485
Xue Zi?

635
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:24,004
Aren't you angry with Zhou Shi?

636
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:25,284
I am!

637
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:26,404
How could she agree with it

638
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:27,644
when she was threatened
with a past favour?

639
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:29,565
She even broke up
with Wei Qing because of this.

640
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:31,884
How could she be so silly?

641
00:32:32,004 --> 00:32:32,845
I have to stop.

642
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:34,644
I'll get lobular hyperplasia if I get angry.

643
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:37,764
If she had rejected it,
she wouldn't have been Zhou Shi.

644
00:32:38,004 --> 00:32:39,485
However, I think there are other reasons too.

645
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:40,404
What do you mean?

646
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:42,565
There should be
other reasons apart from Ning Fei.

647
00:32:42,764 --> 00:32:44,124
Right, Zhou Shi?

648
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:46,365
Breakfast is ready.

649
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:48,004
Let's get ready to eat.

650
00:32:58,244 --> 00:33:00,524
It's a rare opportunity for us
to sit and have breakfast together.

651
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:02,085
Please contribute some topics.

652
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:05,205
We'll go clockwise.

653
00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:07,325
Each of us talks about
an unlucky thing that happened recently.

654
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,725
The one with the most boring
story will wash the dishes.

655
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:11,924
Don't start yourself.

656
00:33:13,485 --> 00:33:15,445
Come on, Best Actress. Warm it up.

657
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:22,445
Speaking of bad luck,

658
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:24,205
who is unluckier than me?

659
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:26,124
Just because of my gluttony,

660
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:28,325
I took a few bites
of the expensive caviar

661
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:30,284
and got an allergic reaction.

662
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:32,325
I was even trapped in the lift.

663
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:38,004
What happened after that?

664
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,404
Then, Ning Fei 2.0 and I

665
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:44,085
nearly...

666
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,205
In the lift?

667
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,924
You're really good at this.

668
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:53,524
Ning Fei 2.0?

669
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:56,805
It's that brat whose attitude changed a lot.

670
00:33:56,965 --> 00:33:58,365
He not only deleted the internal storage,

671
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:00,805
but he also restored part of it
automatically without me knowing.

672
00:34:02,404 --> 00:34:03,605
How dare you laugh at me.

673
00:34:04,805 --> 00:34:05,644
He didn't

674
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,244
inform me about the system reboot.

675
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:11,124
What's his personality now? Lovesick?

676
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:12,605
So flirtatious.

677
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:15,645
His name is Xue Ning.
He's not bad in nature.

678
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,885
He's just a little evil.

679
00:34:19,004 --> 00:34:20,764
That's because you pamper him too much.

680
00:34:20,885 --> 00:34:22,325
Tell you what, if he were with me,

681
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:23,684
I might change his personality

682
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:25,044
at any time.

683
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:28,885
I'll leave him to you in the future.

684
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:32,365
Actually, in order to
make the entire change,

685
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:34,244
I think you're better than me.

686
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:39,645
Why did you bring this up suddenly?

687
00:34:39,764 --> 00:34:41,565
Aren't we playing games now?

688
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,044
Aren't you embarrassed?

689
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,244
It was you who started with the lift play,

690
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:46,964
how do you expect us to continue?

691
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,284
Just feel free.

692
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:56,764
It's nothing special.

693
00:34:57,325 --> 00:34:59,204
I think it was yesterday.

694
00:35:00,244 --> 00:35:01,405
In the hotel, something big

695
00:35:01,805 --> 00:35:03,684
almost happened between Wei Qing and me.

696
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:05,605
What happened?

697
00:35:06,165 --> 00:35:07,165
We finally met after a long time,

698
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:09,004
we couldn't hold...

699
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:11,244
Do you think this is an American drama?

700
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,204
Can you not be so explicit?

701
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:14,125
I...

702
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:15,204
Who made the move first?

703
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,365
Who made the move first?

704
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,845
Okay, this is good.

705
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:22,764
I was worried that the both
of you wouldn't make it.

706
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:24,764
In fact, you both
have made a lot of progress.

707
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,125
Then?

708
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:27,764
You both can reconcile with each other.

709
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:30,085
I didn't think so much.

710
00:35:30,684 --> 00:35:32,565
If I really have to say,

711
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:34,044
it's probably

712
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:35,284
because

713
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:36,724
I miss him too much.

714
00:35:38,724 --> 00:35:40,125
Okay, tell you what, you lost.

715
00:35:40,284 --> 00:35:41,805
Bi Qiujing, it's a total loss.

716
00:35:41,964 --> 00:35:43,204
I don't think you have

717
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,645
something more interesting than hers.

718
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:48,405
Indeed.

719
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:50,044
It's nothing.

720
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:51,885
It's just...

721
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:54,325
My husband might have an affair.

722
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:56,845
What?

723
00:35:57,004 --> 00:35:58,764
Why are your reactions so strong?

724
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,764
Say that again.

725
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,125
