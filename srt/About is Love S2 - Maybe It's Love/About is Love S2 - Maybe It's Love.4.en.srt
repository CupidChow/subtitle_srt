16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Zhou Shi.

17
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,310
So,

18
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,080
did you meet Ning Fei overseas?

19
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,440
Don't worry. With me on the lookout,

20
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,720
Fei won't get lost.

21
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,800
No.

22
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,440
I haven't seen him since two years ago.

23
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,390
I'll get going then.

24
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,550
Doctor, she's awake.

25
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,270
How do you feel?

26
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Is there anything wrong with you?

27
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,390
Seems to be conscious.

28
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,800
What about the boy she was found with?

29
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,720
Seriously injured.

30
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,910
You can't go.

31
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,800
Please come back.

32
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,830
Come back. You need to stay in bed.

33
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,080
You can't...

34
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,520
Where's Fei? Is he okay?

35
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,000
Please tell me.

36
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,470
It will be your fault

37
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,750
if anything happens to him.

38
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,360
Who are you to be concerned about him?

39
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,070
(He suffers from rib fractures)

40
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,950
(and multiple external injuries.)

41
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,270
(The most serious
is the blunt trauma on his head,)

42
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,320
(which has led to acute bleeding
inside his brain.)

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,440
Even if his life was saved,

44
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,070
there's likely to be an aftereffect.

45
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,480
All this happened

46
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,270
because he was trying to save you.

47
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,670
Does it feel good to be saved

48
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,110
by risking someone else's life?

49
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,040
Do you feel like running away?

50
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,070
I've seen many ingrates.

51
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,480
I don't expect you to be an exception.

52
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
There's one more thing
that you need to know.

53
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,760
I, Xue Zi, never make

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,480
a bad investment.

55
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,440
I'll make others pay me back tenfold

56
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,880
for what they owe me.

57
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,920
About Fei,

58
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,640
a mere "thank you"
isn't going to cut it.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,110
What do you want me to do?

60
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,920
Before he recovers,

61
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,110
I want you to stay by his side.

62
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,230
Okay.

63
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Don't agree too soon.

64
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,720
My condition

65
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,920
is for you to only stay by his side.

66
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,230
I want you to cut off all contact

67
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,920
within this period,

68
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,510
especially Wei Qing.

69
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,270
Why?

70
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,760
Because I like him.

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,790
Can't I separate you two?

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,160
Stop joking, Miss Xue.

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,550
You can even use your own little brother
as a bargaining chip,

74
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,200
how can you easily take
a fancy on someone else?

75
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,320
You're after Xunran's paintings, right?

76
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,350
Go on.

77
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,000
I may have proprietary rights
to the drawings.

78
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,670
But even if I want
to transfer ownership,

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,550
it still needs approval
from the painter.

80
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,550
With Fei's current condition,

81
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,230
it's impossible to get ownership.

82
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,480
You had no choice
but to settle for less.

83
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,110
You want to lower the risk by using me.

84
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,510
Am I right?

85
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,830
So?

86
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,510
Are you trying to make a deal with me

87
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,550
after understanding all these?

88
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,230
No.

89
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,070
I'll do it.

90
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,790
Just like you said,

91
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,830
I owe Fei.

92
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,920
Before I repay him,

93
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,390
I have no right to think for myself.

94
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,640
Good.

95
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,720
Since you have such awareness,

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,480
(Wei Qing)
prove it to me.

97
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,760
What?

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,160
He's missing?

99
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,600
When did that happen?

100
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,720
Search every bar

101
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,110
and nightclub nearby.

102
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,510
You must find him

103
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,000
within 12 hours.

104
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,390
That's all.

105
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,480
Ms. Xue.

106
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,830
Sit.

107
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,880
You're late.

108
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,000
Something came up.

109
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,720
I don't think that's all.

110
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,790
Just the hotel
where the exhibition is held

111
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,830
is enough for you to remember your past.

112
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,070
Did you meet anyone you want to meet

113
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,040
while revisiting places you've been to?

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,480
Boss,

115
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,880
I've stayed by your side for two years.

116
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,110
Aren't you bored of playing

117
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,440
the same game?

118
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,720
It's better to get down to business.

119
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,670
Looks like you didn't meet anyone.

120
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,670
How boring.

121
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,050
(Asian Art Biennial Cooperation Project)

122
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,950
Asian Art Biennial?

123
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,200
I thought Mr. Xue was following this up.

124
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,070
He can't manage.

125
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,230
He got tricked regarding the arrangement
of the exhibition.

126
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,550
We have to find another person
to do the negotiation.

127
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,920
Me?

128
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,000
Who else?

129
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,790
If I don't send my own people,

130
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,320
how can I have control over Xue Le?

131
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,200
Even if you hand it over to me,

132
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,670
it may not necessarily...

133
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,550
(Legal Representative: Wei Qing)

134
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,110
Are you that excited?

135
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,110
I might have caught a cold
in the countryside.

136
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,080
Ms. Xue, I need to take some days off.

137
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,230
Don't even think about it.

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,470
I have a fever.

139
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,960
Oh, you do.

140
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,000
Go to the hospital tomorrow.

141
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,840
Okay.

142
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,110
After your fever goes down,

143
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,880
go to Yunma.

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,080
Ms. Xue,

145
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,960
you made me leave him back then.

146
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,470
There's nothing
between the two of us now.

147
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,000
Yet you're telling me to go back?

148
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,520
It's hard to say.

149
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,590
What if he still misses you

150
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,440
and wants to get back together?

151
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,080
If we could get back together,

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,840
I wouldn't have left back then.

153
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,590
Ms. Xue,

154
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,470
it's impossible for him and me now.

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,080
Don't be so sure about that.

156
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,760
Just use him, then.

157
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,230
That'll work, right?

158
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,670
What's wrong?

159
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,760
Don't tell me you want me
to handle him personally?

160
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,550
Actually,
if Wei Qing doesn't ruin my plan,

161
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,030
I don't want to make things difficult
for him either.

162
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,710
I won't object if you want to rekindle

163
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,200
your old relationship,

164
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,200
as long as you can overcome
what's troubling you.

165
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,080
How's my little brother?

166
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,910
He returned to the country with you.

167
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,760
I hope he doesn't wander around
by himself.

168
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,760
He's no longer the same Ning Fei.

169
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
If you don't watch him,

170
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,840
something might happen.

171
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,150
I understand.

172
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,350
(Outpatient Department)
Hello.

173
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,230
We found him.

174
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,840
He just left the villa.

175
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,350
I think he spent the night

176
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,400
at a friend's party last night.

177
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,350
What's wrong with your voice?

178
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,350
I thought you were a stranger.

179
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,520
Open your mouth.

180
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,550
Give me the thermometer.

181
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,640
It's 38.9 degrees.

182
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,710
The high fever
is caused by acute tonsillitis.

183
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,080
Is it serious?

184
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,790
I mean, will it affect my work?

185
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,910
Something like that.

186
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,000
If you don't keep it under control,

187
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,470
it can lead to pneumonia.

188
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,910
Boss,

189
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,550
you heard that, right?

190
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,550
I might not be able to go to Yun...

191
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,030
Doctor,

192
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,080
is there anything

193
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,790
that can prolong

194
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,230
this illness?

195
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
What's wrong with you?

196
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,000
Get your medicine and your shot.

197
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,550
Here.

198
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,880
(According to his medical history
and examination,)

199
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,880
(he is initially diagnosed
with acute optic neuritis.)

200
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,280
(It's called "sudden blindness"
in traditional Chinese medicine.)

201
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,350
(Usually, it can be induced)

202
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,790
(by excessive fatigue)

203
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,880
(or too much mental stress.)

204
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,880
(In the short term,)

205
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,320
(it can even cause
a sharp decline in vision)

206
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,440
(and even blindness.)

207
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,320
(This disease is common)

208
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,910
(in ophthalmology.)

209
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,550
(Doctor, since it's common,)

210
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,200
(there's a cure, right?)

211
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,640
(He'll recover as long as
he follows the treatment plan.)

212
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,760
Mr. Wei,

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,640
the doctor's diagnosis is telling

214
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,280
you to rest more.

215
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,590
With your current condition,

216
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,550
you need to stay in the hospital
for observation for some time.

217
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
Okay.

218
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,880
Take care of it.

219
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,760
All right. I'll take care

220
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
of the hospitalization procedure.

221
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,710
By the way, Mr. Wei

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,590
what about the company?

223
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,880
You'll take care

224
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,590
of the company temporarily.

225
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,590
Cancel all meetings

226
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,440
and change them to conference calls.

227
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,840
Find me

228
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,320
a keypad phone.

229
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,670
The simpler, the better.

230
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Don't let the news

231
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,230
of my illness get out.

232
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,440
Okay.

233
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,670
Wait.

234
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,350
Where's the restroom?

235
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,320
Go straight to the end and turn right.

236
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,030
I'll take you there.

237
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,910
It's okay.

238
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,400
I need to get used
to this sooner or later.

239
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,030
You won't be able to help me.

240
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,080
Don't follow me.

241
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,400
Mr. Wei, be careful.

242
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,080
Do you need help?

243
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,760
May I ask the direction to the restroom?

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,150
Walk straight and turn right.
Let me take you there.

245
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,280
It's okay.

246
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,400
Thank you.

Have some. It's good for your health.

Oh, you seem to know your stuff.

Aren't you from the sponsor's side?

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,670
How come you have the time
to visit the filming site?

296
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,030
Oh, I know. You're here to discuss
the product placement.

297
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
You can say that.

Jewelry brand is indeed rich

But we're filming a road accident scene.

300
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,080
How are you going to do the placement?

301
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,110
Road accident?

302
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,960
It's my first time watching
the filming of a road accident.

303
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,280
What's written on the script?

304
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,550
Sir,

305
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,080
Madam has been kneeling all night
on the road.

306
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,470
Let her be. Since she's alive,

307
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,910
let her keep kneeling.

308
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,840
She's dead now.

309
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,710
The pace of the plot is too fast
for product placement.

310
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,710
We'll do it in slow motion this time.

311
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,550
Didn't the car just hit you lightly?

312
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,560
You didn't have to fly so high.
Are you faking it to extort money?

313
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,710
The wasn't any car
when you kneeled all night.

314
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,160
Suddenly, you were hit by a car today.

315
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,800
Where's the logic? Also,

316
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,830
why did you have to kneel
on the road of all places?

317
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,710
I just follow the script.

318
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,160
Exactly.

319
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,590
What's the point of this scene?

320
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,310
Begging to be abused.

321
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,470
If you think this scene is bad,

322
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,710
let's look at another scene.

323
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,230
Sir,

324
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,800
Madam hung herself from the exhaust.

325
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,470
She fainted after turning
for three hours.

326
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,560
Sir, Madam is hanging herself
at the anti-climb fence.

327
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,640
She's turning into human jerky.

328
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,400
Sir, Madam said

329
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
if you don't forgive her,

330
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,160
she'll kneel on the beach forever.

331
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,920
Does she know where she did wrong?

332
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,880
No,

333
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,520
she turned into a sand sculpture.

334
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,920
Enough. This is nonsense.

335
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,680
I'm pulling out my investment.

336
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,430
What did you say?

337
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Why must the CEO abuse people?

338
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,710
Is no one abusing the CEO?

339
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,950
She's recovered from fatigue and fever.

340
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Did you hear

341
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,800
about a CEO staying

342
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,310
in the VIP room upstairs?

343
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,920
It's Wei Qing of Yunma.

344
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,710
Honestly, he's pitiful.

345
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
But I don't sympathize with him.

346
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,110
Why?

347
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,710
Other than not cooperating
with his treatment,

348
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,430
he keeps pulling that long face.

349
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,310
I would have thrown a fit

350
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,560
if it weren't for his inability to see.

351
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,680
He can't see?

352
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,760
Wait.

353
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,400
The patient you were talking about,

354
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,310
where does he usually go?

355
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,880
(It's the first time)

356
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,830
(I see the same thing)

357
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,830
(when I close and open my eyes.)

358
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,640
(This time,)

359
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,000
(I can't even see an illusion of you.)

360
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,760
(It's time for you to stop)

361
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,160
(your obsession with Zhou Shi.)

362
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,000
If you think you're right,

363
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,760
don't come after me!

364
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,520
(I didn't do anything wrong.
Just leave if you want to!)

365
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,160
(I'll never apologize to you!)

366
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,190
(Perhaps)

367
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,710
(it's time to say goodbye.)

368
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,560
Mister, are you crying?

369
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,590
My balloon!

370
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,800
I'm sorry for overreacting.

371
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,230
It's my fault.

372
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,230
How about this?

373
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,070
I'll buy you a new one. Is that okay?

374
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,110
No, I want that one.

375
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,680
Well,

376
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,070
thank you.

377
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,560
The balloon.

378
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,590
Here's your balloon.
Stop walking around randomly.

379
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,920
Mister, I should say the same to you.

380
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,230
Thank you.

381
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,430
You're welcome.

382
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,110
Sorry about that.

383
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,710
Well,

384
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,230
can you get a caretaker for me?

385
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,110
I just started using this.

386
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,350
I'm still not used to it.

387
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,000
(He doesn't seem to recognize my voice.)

388
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,590
What's wrong with your eyes?

389
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,350
Acute optic neuritis.

390
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,070
It's not a serious illness.

391
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,640
The doctor said I'll recover

392
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,190
if I follow the treatment plan.

393
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,280
That's great.

394
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,560
There's nothing great about it.

395
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,640
Maybe

396
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,190
there are other illnesses
that they haven't found yet.

397
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,470
What's the matter with you?

398
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,400
It's only been two years.

399
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
Why did you turn out like this?

400
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,190
You know me?

401
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,520
You're Wei Qing,

402
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,350
the one who's trending
on the news all year long.

403
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,350
They publish everything big
and small about you.

404
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,350
It's hard not to recognize you.

405
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,310
I've been single for two years now.

406
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,800
They still have something
to write about me?

407
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,470
That's as expected from me.

408
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,040
Single?

409
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,640
You don't have a girlfriend?

410
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,640
Look at me now.

411
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,710
Not a single girl comes to visit me.

412
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,640
Doesn't that tell you something?

413
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,640
You're so interested
in my personal life.

414
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,000
Are you a journalist?

415
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,590
No, I...

416
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm just a passerby.

417
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,560
A passerby won't know
what happened two years ago.

418
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,640
So, which news agency you're from?

419
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,880
Why are you approaching me?

420
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,520
I...

421
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,640
Mr. Wei!

422
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,190
Mr. Wei!

423
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,470
Mr. Wei,

424
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,040
why are you out here again?

425
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,520
I can't see now.

426
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,310
I still need to get
some fresh air, don't I?

427
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,920
Wei An, did you see a lady

428
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,680
when you came here?

429
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,000
A lady?

430
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,560
Mr. Wei, you're already in this state.
Why are you still...

431
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,640
Don't worry. I know my place.

432
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,680
What are you looking for?

433
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,880
She dropped something when she let.

434
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,230
Help me search the ground.

435
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,280
Okay.

436
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,350
- Come on! Start rolling!
- Okay.

437
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,470
Ready! One, two, three, and action!

438
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,400
Cut! Nice!

439
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,430
Next scene.

440
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Moving on! Moving on!

441
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,880
Moving on! Fix her makeup!

442
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,800
Wipe it off.

443
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,680
Where's my phone?

444
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,000
It's with me.

445
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,040
With that blood all over my mouth,

446
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,710
my ex-boyfriend wouldn't recognize me,
right?

447
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,000
Shangjue's jewelry

448
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,160

Let them change the actress!

♪My heartache is just an impact crater♪

506
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,880
(It may take a while.)

507
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,430
(But I promise)

508
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,520
(I'll come back.)

509
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
(Wait for me.)

♪Would you notice the meteor

512
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
(I've been single for two years now.)

513
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,350
(They still have something
to write about me?)

514
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,920
(That's as expected from me.)

515
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,470
(Single?)

516
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,110
(You don't have a girlfriend?)

517
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,040
(Look at me now.)

518
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,110
(Not a single girl comes to visit me.)

519
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,070
(Doesn't that tell you something?)

520
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,760
Zhou Shi,

521
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,880
you're finally home.

522
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,400
What? You didn't meet your ex-boyfriend?

523
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,040
I knew...

524
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,190
I saw him.

525
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,160
What happened after that?

526
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,310
Are you back together again?

527
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,470
That hurts.

528
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,310
I thought you didn't know.

529
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,640
Will you wander off again?

530
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,070
I won't do it again.

531
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,280
Are you going to install the voice pack?

532
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,680
If you don't like it,
I'll change another one for you.

533
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,350
I'll install a voice changer
for you next time.

534
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,470
Did you say "next time?"

535
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,230
Zhou Shi, I won't do it again.

536
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,590
What happened?

537
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,880
Zhou Shi?

538
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,920
Shut up and look up.

539
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,160
Don't look at me.

540
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,310
What a fool.

541
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,270
(Switching off)

542
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,230
Heaven is against me!

543
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,830
(You're finally leaving.)

544
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,230
Sit down first.

545
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,880
I thought you were going
to cry here all night.

546
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:05,920
Wait.

547
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
How long have you been here?

548
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,040
Well,

549
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,070
when you said, "I quit!

550
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,710
Let them change the actress!"

551
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,000
Around that time.

552
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,470
You should have left
when you were done gloating over me.

553
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Why did you stay?

554
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,280
To take you back to the production crew.

555
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,470
Or do you expect me to come
all the way here to see you cry?

556
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,350
No, wait...

557
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,640
What are you doing?

558
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,070
To apply the antiseptic.

559
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,430
Wait.

560
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,830
Be gentle.

561
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,000
It'll sting a little. Bear with it.

562
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,760
Can you still walk?

563
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,760
Of course.

564
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,160
What did I tell you before we came back?

565
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,430
You promised not to scare anyone.

566
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,400
Before we returned, you didn't say

567
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,310
you were back to reunite with him.

568
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,110
Do I know him?

569
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,560
Because you'll remember him
sooner or later.

570
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,110
Is he someone close to me too?

571
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,950
You can say he's your senior.

572
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,430
I don't remember,
and I won't acknowledge him.

573
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,190
But listen.

574
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,950
Even if you wanted
to rekindle your relationship,

575
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,880
can't you do it somewhere else?

576
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

577
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
I didn't take the initiative
to meet him.

578
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,520
If it wasn't because his health is...

579
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,800
What's wrong with his health?

580
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,560
Test my patience again.

581
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,000
That hurts.

582
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,800
Have you taken your medicine?

583
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,000
It's too bitter.

584
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,040
I'd rather suffer
from insomnia than eat it.

585
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,800
Are you going to feed me with your lips?

586
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,800
Is your phone the latest model?

587
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,040
I'll buy a new one for you.

588
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,160
It's okay.

589
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,310
I made you finish work late.

590
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,400
How much are your overtime fees?
I'll reimburse you.

591
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,640
Miss Lin,

592
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,830
you should know
the order of apologies first.

593
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,110
Okay?

594
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,070
I'm sorry.

595
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,110
And?

596
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,520
There's more?

597
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,230
Do you want me to kneel
to ask for forgiveness?

598
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,190
Can't you see I have a twisted ankle?

599
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,920
I'm asking you the reason.

600
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,680
Why did you leave the filming set

601
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,400
like a madwoman?

602
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,800
You don't want to tell me?

603
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,070
Pretend that I never asked.

604
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,920
Are you asking on behalf
of the production crew?

605
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,430
I'm sick.

606
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,950
I have ADHD and bipolar disorder.

607
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,190
I had a nervous attack this afternoon.

608
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,160
That's the worst excuse.

609
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,590
Why don't you just say the guy

610
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,310
who passed by is your ex-boyfriend?

611
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,000
Are you serious?

612
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,710
I got it right?

613
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,430
So that's the guy who used a ring

614
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,230
to keep you trapped for two years?

615
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,070
How dare he show himself.

616
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,680
All right. I'll stop talking.

617
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,430
No, that's not him.

618
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,560
(He won't look at me like that.)

619
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,280
(He won't just abandon me.)

620
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,000
You're right.

621
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,230
That can't be him.
