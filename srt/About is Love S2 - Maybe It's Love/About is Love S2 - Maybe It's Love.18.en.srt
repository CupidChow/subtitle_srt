I was looking for you.

22
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,400
Sit.

23
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,910
Xue Le just sent me an email.

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
He wants me to punish you.

25
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,000
You betrayed the company

26
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,440
and jeopardized its interests.

27
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,870
Ms. Xue, I...

28
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,800
No need to explain.

29
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,080
I get it.

30
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,390
Looks like my little brother
is getting antsy.

31
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,670
He wants to show off.

32
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,080
Tomorrow,

33
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,720
you will still come to work at Snow.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,750
Ms. Xue.

35
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,360
You're still keeping me?

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,360
Why?

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,750
Am I supposed to be wary of you

38
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,390
because you're Yunma's main shareholder?

39
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't forget.

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,670
I'm also Yunma's shareholder.

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
But

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,360
if you wish to stay with Wei Qing...

43
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,600
No, I rather stay at Snow.

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,000
Yunma is planning
to share resources with Shangjue.

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,550
They'll also provide pieces
for the biennial

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,030
to ensure it runs as planned.

47
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,520
The copyright
is Yunma's bargaining chip.

48
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,360
I'm surprised they invested so much.

49
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,520
How did Xue Le do it?

50
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,720
Wei An isn't someone
you can bribe easily.

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
I'm guessing

52
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,630
Xue Le must have some dirt on him.

53
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,800
Do you not

54
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,520
have any idea, Ms. Xue?

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,320
What would I know?

56
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,320
Even if Xue Le did have
something on him,

57
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,190
do you think he'd tell me?

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
How is Wei Qing now?

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,630
He's depressed.

60
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,960
I mean, he was betrayed
by a trusted friend.

61
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,360
He needs more time.

62
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,600
It's not like him to give up so easily.

63
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,880
Whether or not we partner up
with Yunma in the future,

64
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,190
I'll like my counterpart to be him.

65
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,360
And not some traitor.

66
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,110
Stay with him for the time being.

67
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,110
As for your work...

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,110
Thanks, Ms. Xue.

69
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,630
But, I don't want to mix
personal matters with work.

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,630
I don't want it
to interfere with my job.

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,720
I will talk to him personally.

72
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,550
Okay.

73
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll be leaving then.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,830
You're home.

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,390
Well? Very clean, right?

76
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,000
It's clean.

77
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,440
Not bad. You learned to do house chores.

78
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,360
That I did.

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,670
Come look at this.

80
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,230
Let me tell you.

81
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,670
Not only can this mop clean the floor,

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,720
but it can also wax
and get rid of mites.

83
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,670
Amazing, right?

84
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
It can even dispense water.

85
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,440
Really?

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,390
Try it.

87
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,760
- What do you think? It's useful, right?
- Nice.

88
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,670
It's really good, isn't it?

89
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,760
Yes, it is.

90
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,270
Very useful.

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Right, there's also the vacuum robot.

92
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,760
It can automatically empty the bin.

93
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,040
And it can be programmed to clean
at specific times and areas.

94
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,320
Isn't it amazing?

95
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,230
Hold on.

96
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,550
You bought a lot of stuff.

97
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,790
Are you planning to become
a househusband?

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Nothing wrong
with being a househusband.

99
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,200
Next time, you'll be the breadwinner.

100
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,230
I'm in charge of...

101
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,720
The pretty looks?

102
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,480
No, no. You have the pretty looks.

103
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,070
And you'll be the breadwinner.

104
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,640
While I'll enjoy eating and drinking.

105
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,320
In your dreams.

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,110
Wei An wants to share resources
with Shangjue.

107
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,350
He also plans to replace Wu Zheng

108
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,440
with other artworks

109
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,550
for the biennial.

110
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Xue Le fired me from Shangjue.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,350
But Xue Zi wants me to continue at Snow.

112
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,760
I think the two siblings

113
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,230
are preparing for war.

114
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,040
What do you think?

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,950
We're having dinner right now.

116
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,880
Let's not talk about work.

117
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,480
Alright, don't worry.

118
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,270
Did you forget?

119
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,790
I'm the unbeatable Wei Qing.

120
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,640
If someone were to beat me,

121
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,200
it could only be

122
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,670
the barbaric woman

123
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,040
with unbelievable strength.

124
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,110
I'm trying to comfort you.

125
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,390
How could you bring up my dark past?

126
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,950
No.

127
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,720
Actually, it's your dark past.

128
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,550
I mean, you were the one
who got pinned down on the ground.

129
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,790
What I meant was,

130
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,760
if I'm going to lose to someone,

131
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,320
it will be to you.

132
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,880
There's no way I'd lose to anyone else.

133
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,390
Sure. You're the strongest.

134
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,480
Let's eat.

135
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,760
Hey.

136
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,600
Can you stay
and keep me company tonight?

137
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,950
I can't.

138
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,510
I just returned to Snow.

139
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
There are a lot of things
I need to pick up.

140
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,000
How about the weekend?

141
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,600
That's a deal.

142
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
What's going on?

143
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,320
Is doing house chores a trend now?

144
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,830
Zhou Shi.

145
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,390
You're back.

146
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,160
Where's Feifei?

147
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,200
She's still filming.

148
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,040
So I came home to tidy up the place.

149
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,640
Ms. Zhou, I have something to ask you.

150
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,600
Come this way.

151
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,040
What is it?

152
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,670
I like Lin Feifei.

153
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,390
Can you help me woo her?

154
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
You like Feifei?

155
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,720
So you...

156
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,591
I know

157
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,270
all of you wish for me
to regain my memory.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,350
But have you ever thought

159
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,200
what if I never remember?

160
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,670
Does that mean you won't accept

161
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,880
the current me?

162
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,350
I also know

163
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,950
that I wasn't good enough in the past.

164
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,600
I can change.

165
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,350
If you guys insist on having Ning Fei,

166
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,070
I can change my name.

167
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,110
But

168
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,230
you guys have to accept the current me.

169
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,070
Can you tell me

170
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,270
why you suddenly wish to change?

171
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,110
I was rebellious before.

172
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,480
The more you guys wanted me to remember,

173
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,880
the more I rejected it.

174
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
But I've thought it through.

175
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,390
I can't go on like this forever.

176
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,550
I need to live my own life.

177
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,640
When I thought about it carefully,

178
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,640
you guys only knew me

179
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,600
for about two years.

180
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,070
I understand

181
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,200
you must have shared
wonderful memories together.

182
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,550
But we'll spend more time together
in the future.

183
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,390
We'll create even more memories.

184
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,720
So,

185
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,350
are you guys going to dwell in the past?

186
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,760
Or let it go

187
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,320
and move forward?

188
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,270
You're right.

189
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,520
I've thought about it too.

190
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
It's not your fault
you lost your memory.

191
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,320
I am willing to accept the new you.

192
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,880
But

193
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,760
we can't ignore the memories
of the past.

194
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,670
Especially for Feifei.

195
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,470
I'm not in the position
to decide for her.

196
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,470
If you want us to move on,

197
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,230
you'll need to convince us

198
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,910
to accept the current you.

199
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,670
Especially Feifei.

200
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
I'll prove to everyone
that the current me

201
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,840
is better than the old me.

202
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,400
I will let you all

203
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,590
adore the current me.

204
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,670
I know you will.

205
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,910
What is it?

206
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,080
I can't sleep.

207
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,790
I thought we could chat for a while.

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
Chat?

209
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,470
I have to work tomorrow.

210
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,280
It's too late to be chatting.

211
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,760
Just keep the video running.

212
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,880
I'll be able to sleep looking at you.

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,790
What?

214
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,910
Is my face a sleep inducer now?

215
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,150
How's this?

216
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,640
Does this work?

217
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,880
You look good.

218
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,710
You've really become a smooth talker.

219
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,280
Greasy old man.

220
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,110
Go sleep and stop looking at me.

221
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,910
Or I'll hang up.

222
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,640
Okay, I'll go to sleep.

223
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,470
Good night.

224
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Good night.

225
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,110
I hope we'll be good forever.

226
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,150
Who is it?

227
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Who's there?

228
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,910
Stop knocking. I'm coming.

229
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Why are you here?

230
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,440
I came to deliver
your breakfast with love.

231
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,200
Who rang the doorbell so early?

232
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,710
Are they asking to die?

233
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,710
Who's here so early?
I only got off work at 5 AM.

234
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,590
I finally fell asleep

235
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,760
and the doorbell rang!

236
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,440
It's Wei Qing.
He came to deliver breakfast.

237
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,400
Rein your husband in.

238
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,150
Or else I'm going
to turn you into a widow.

239
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,400
Come in.

240
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,590
Those two guys sure are obnoxious
in the morning.

241
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,200
You woke everyone up. It's only 6 AM.

242
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,550
Why did you have to bring breakfast now?

243
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,080
I slept too early last night.

244
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,520
I woke up at 5 AM.

245
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,320
So I thought
I could give you a surprise.

246
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,910
Thank you.

247
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,470
But can you please

248
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,960
stop sending me breakfast?

249
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,110
I prefer to sleep in.

250
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,440
That won't do.

251
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,080
I've already decided.

252
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,880
Starting now, I'll come to send you
to work and back

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,080
every day.

254
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,960
I have a car.

255
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,350
Driving yourself
can't beat having a driver.

256
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,230
Besides,

257
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,200
I'd love to spend more time with you.

258
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,470
I know you have a lot of time to spare.

259
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,400
And I know you love me.

260
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,910
But I really don't need you to drive me.

261
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,150
Think about it.

262
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,710
What if you send me to Shangjue

263
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,320
and we bump into Xue Zi?

264
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,760
Won't that be awkward?

265
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,840
You're right.

266
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
But I want to be with you more.

267
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,440
I get it, I do.

268
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,440
I know.

269
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,320
Mingcheng is jobless at home, right?

270
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,230
Why don't you hang out with him?

271
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,670
Right. Why didn't I think of him?

272
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,440
Okay. I'll look for him later.

273
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,960
First, wake up and eat breakfast.

274
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,790
You eat. Eat then go look for him.

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm going to sleep some more.

276
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,080
Get up.

277
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,520
Come and eat the buns.

278
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,590
Hurry up!

279
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,880
No!

280
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,230
Alright.

281
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,150
I'll feed you then.

282
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,080
Listen.

283
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,640
My caretaker made these buns.

284
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,760
They're really good. You can't buy them.

285
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,200
- Open wide.
- No.

286
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,080
No, thanks.

287
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,080
Take a bite.

288
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,030
Here, have some soy milk.

289
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,470
Good morning.

290
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,840
Chairman. Come in.

291
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm no longer the chairman.

292
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,790
Is your wife at home?

293
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,640
She's not in. She's gone to school.

294
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,670
You're dressed for the job.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,150
Looks like you're enjoying
your retirement.

296
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,150
Today is house cleaning day.

297
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,110
There's a specific day
to clean the house?

298
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,670
Yes. In this household,

299
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,550
we follow a strict timetable.

300
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,980
(Timetable)
(5th, 9th, house cleaning day)

301
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,910
I guess that's to be expected
from a top student.

302
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,790
Can the designated day be changed?

303
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,400
Theoretically, yes.

304
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,200
Why?

305
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,150
I'm bored by myself. Go out with me.

306
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,640
What? Just go and get changed.

307
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,320
Okay.

308
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:07,600
(House cleaning day)

309
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,320
What does that mean?

310
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,400
It means "postponed".

311
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,440
I'm impressed.

312
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,280
So, that's the plan.

313
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,200
Any problems?

314
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,670
None.

315
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,960
It's just like your style.

316
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,520
So the whole thing is a setup.

317
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,670
And I'm the first person
to fall into it.

318
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,000
That's because I value you.

319
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,590
You're the first person I think of
when there's something good.

320
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,520
Occupational hazard, right?

321
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,440
Are you going to tell Shishi?

322
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,470
Not just yet.

323
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,280
And you, don't tell Miss Brainiac.

324
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,470
Shishi is worried about you.

325
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,640
Are you sure it's okay not to tell her?

326
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm not telling her yet

327
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,080
to keep her safe.

328
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,030
She's getting too close to Xue Zi.

329
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,670
If I tell her,

330
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,670
I worry it might backfire on her.

331
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,670
Xue Ning?

332
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,320
What are you guys doing here?

333
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,550
We're buying groceries.

334
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,790
What are you doing here?

335
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,840
Feifei is shooting at a location nearby.

336
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,440
I came to get some drinks.

337
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,110
Are you

338
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,640
Feifei's full-time assistant right now?

339
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Is she paying you?

340
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,640
I'm not like some people,

341
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,150
who care only about money.

342
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,710
I know.

343
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,760
You're sacrificing for love.

344
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,960
But let me remind you.

345
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,960
You might end up empty-handed.

346
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,590
Even if I lose everything,

347
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,000
it's not as bad as you
giving everything up for a woman.

348
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,470
Poor you that you have
to buy groceries yourself.

349
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,840
Alright. Stop.

350
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,550
It's been a while since we met.

351
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,670
Why don't we all have dinner
at my place tonight?

352
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,670
- No, thanks.
- I'll cook.

353
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,230
Tonight, I'm staying with Feifei.

354
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,350
Ask Feifei to come along.

355
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,760
Ask her if she's free.

356
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,910
Come on. Let's go see Feifei.

357
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,440
Okay. Cut!

358
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,200
Cut! To the next scene.

359
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,080
Change the set.

360
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,080
Take a break, Feifei.

361
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,200
Props, pack up the things.

362
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay.

363
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,710
Feifei, we came to say hi.

364
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,710
What are you guys doing here?

365
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,470
Assistant, bring me some stools.

366
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,310
Okay.

367
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,520
Hurry.

368
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,000
Sit.

369
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,190
Okay, thanks.

370
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,800
Thanks.

371
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,190
We happened to be nearby

372
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,590
and bumped into him buying drinks.

373
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,000
So we decided to drop by.

374
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,470
Mr. Wei and Miss Brainiac's husband
came to greet me personally.

375
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,400
I am so honored.

376
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,800
Feifei.

377
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,520
When will you be done today?

378
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,640
I'm filming day scenes today.

379
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
I'll probably be done before dark.

380
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,760
That's great.

381
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,710
We haven't hung out in a while.

382
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,230
Why don't we have dinner at my place?

383
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,800
Sure.

384
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,070
Go and help the crew.

385
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,040
No.

386
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,310
I want to stay here with you.

387
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,950
I don't need your company. Go and help.

388
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,110
You two seem to be getting along now.

389
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,640
What do you mean by "getting along"?

390
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,430
We've always been like this.

391
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,950
I need to go over my script.

392
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,350
No time to entertain you two.

393
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,470
Go on.

394
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,640
Go.

395
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,230
Go back.

396
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,070
Let's go.

397
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,000
Come on, Little Assistant.

398
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,310
Let me take my stuff.

399
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
- Bye.
- All the best.

400
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,430
See you tonight.

401
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,160
See you tonight.

402
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,190
- Bye.
- Don't be late.

403
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,070
Mr. Wei.

404
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,350
Why are you here?

405
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,310
It's none of your business.

406
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,950
Actually, I've been wanting
to talk to you.

407
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,110
Even though you are no longer

408
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,470
Yunma's chairman,

409
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,040
you are still well-versed.

410
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,400
I wonder if you have any good advice

411
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,920
regarding Yunma
and Shangjue's cooperation.

412
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,040
With your smarts,

413
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,590
I don't think you need my advice.

414
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,710
However,

415
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,680
I do have a gentle reminder for you.

416
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,800
It's best not to annoy

417
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,430
an opponent you can't beat.

418
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,590
Won't it be boring though

419
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,430
if the opponent is weak?

420
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,000
I like taking on an impossible challenge

421
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,470
and then proving them wrong.

422
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,520
The result isn't out yet.

423
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,470
Don't celebrate too soon.

424
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,280
Is that so?

425
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,190
I'd like to see

426
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,350
what else you have up your sleeve.

427
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,710
I won't disturb your rest then.

428
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,950
I have things to do.

429
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,070
See you.

430
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,880
It was him.

431
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,430
What do you mean?

432
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,920
He's the one who pushed me.

433
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,920
Leave that to the police.

434
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,350
Such conduct will be punished by law.

435
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,680
We'll make a police report.

436
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,070
Let's go. There's a lot to do.

437
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,830
Come on.

438
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,110
Go and inform the others.

439
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,190
I'll treat everyone to dinner.

440
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay.

441
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,040
Feifei.

442
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,800
Mr. Xue.

443
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,470
Why the formal address?

444
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,040
You can just call me Xue Le.

445
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,760
Join me for dinner tonight.

446
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,040
Tonight?

447
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,560
I will be filming till late.
I'm not free.

448
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,760
Aren't you guys
shooting day scenes today?

449
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,110
Why would you be working late?

450
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,470
I've spoken to the director.

451
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,800
I'm buying the crew dinner.

452
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,070
No reason for you to feel awkward then.

453
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,400
If you still won't come,

454
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,680
that means

455
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,350
you really don't like me.

456
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,040
Okay then.

457
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,470
See you tonight.

458
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,760
(Don't touch me.)

459
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,310
- What's all the shouting?
- You're annoying.

460
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,160
Why are you guys arguing?

461
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,880
You two are finally home.

462
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,160
Those two guys...

463
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,040
What are you arguing about?

464
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,160
We need pounded garlic.

465
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,160
He didn't know how to,
but he insisted on doing it.

466
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,640
Who said I don't know how to?

467
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,640
I was doing it
but you kept interrupting.

468
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,470
You were doing it? What?

469
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,640
You pounded the garlic so hard
that it flew into my eyes.

470
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
- How...
- Zip it.

471
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,310
Give it to me.

472
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,280
I said, give it.

473
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,920
And you.

474
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,280
Pounded garlic?

475
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,070
You guys are just making trouble.

476
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,560
Mingcheng.

477
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,160
I'll do it.

478
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,310
Thanks, Shishi.

479
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,430
Darling, are you tired?

480
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,040
Are you tired?

481
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,190
No.

482
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,800
I think you're more tired.

483
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,710
You have to cook
while looking after two kids.

484
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,110
So, I need some comfort.

485
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,160
I need comforting too.

486
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,040
What? Don't be a busybody.

487
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,830
Where's Feifei?

488
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,280
Where's my Feifei?

489
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,710
Feifei gave me a call.

490
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,190
She said she couldn't join us
because she has a gathering tonight.

491
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,680
She wanted me to apologize

492
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,110
to Miss Brainiac and Mingcheng.

493
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,190
A gathering?

494
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,760
Why didn't she tell me?

495
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,070
Why does she need to?
You're just an assistant.

496
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,560
Who are you calling "assistant"?

497
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,520
You bankrupt chairman.

498
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,070
Shut up.

499
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,070
And get to work.

500
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,880
I'm going to call Feifei.

501
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,560
You know what?

502
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
I learned how to cook a dish
from Li Mingcheng.

503
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,190
It's called,

504
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,040
Snow-capped Flaming Mountain.

505
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,190
Why don't I make it for you?

506
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,280
Snow-capped?

507
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,830
Do you mean salad tomatoes?

508
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,280
Hey, I'll add more sugar for you.

509
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,800
Eat more later, okay?

510
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,070
Darling.

511
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,800
I've showered. It's your turn.

512
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,680
Okay.

513
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,190
Darling.

514
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,950
There's something
I want to discuss with you.

515
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,640
Go on.

516
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,110
I'm planning to get a new job.

517
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,350
So soon?

518
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,950
You're not going to wait
for Wei Qing to counterattack?

519
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,830
I talked to Wei Qing.

520
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,710
He's the one who encouraged me to do it.

521
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,310
He asked you to?

522
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,040
I thought Wei Qing was only hibernating

523
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,640
and will unleash himself soon.

524
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,760
As his right-hand man,

525
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,830
you should be prepared alongside him.

526
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,950
Maybe Wei An's betrayal

527
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,430
left a huge impact on him.

528
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,680
The way he talked today

529
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
sounded a bit negative.

530
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,680
So you...

531
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,430
Darling.

532
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,590
That's why I want to look for a new job.

533
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,950
I know we still have our savings,

534
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,710
but I can't be jobless forever.

535
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,520
I trust in your decision.

536
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,310
I'll go shower then.

537
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,310
He's already found

538
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,470
a company to interview at?

539
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,724
(Progress in Investigation)
(To Li Mingcheng)

540
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:49,700
(Company for interview)

541
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,000
A message from Wei Qing?

542
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,430
Feifei didn't come in the end.

543
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,920
So the guy drank by himself.

544
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,800
Do you think

545
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
he's really in love with Feifei?

546
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,310
He spoke to me yesterday.

547
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,950
At first, I had hoped

548
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,520
he would regain his memory quickly.

549
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,640
But even after so long,

550
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,520
there hasn't been any change.

551
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,040
I've spoken with Dr. Chen.

552
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,520
Dr. Chen said, aside from medication,

553
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,000
the best treatment is hypnotherapy.

554
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,310
But he wouldn't do it.

555
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,400
I've been busy with work
since coming back.

556
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,430
I haven't been able to attend to him.

557
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,950
I thought

558
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,230
it was fine as long as
he was living happily.

559
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,520
It didn't matter
if he regained his memory or not.

560
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,040
The only worry

561
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,880
is that Feifei can't accept it.

562
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,470
But judging from the way
Feifei treated Xue Ning today,

563
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,640
it seems like

564
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,430
it's not too bad.

565
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,040
And,

566
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,310
the two actually seemed close.

567
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,280
Do you think so?

568
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,310
Alright, now. Stop worrying.

569
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,920
They're both adults.

570
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,560
Just go with the flow.

571
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,470
Thanks, Mr. Xue.

572
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,070
Take care on the way back.

573
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,470
I'm not ready to leave yet.

574
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,830
You don't have to chase me away.

575
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,520
Feifei.

576
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,190
I don't know what happened

577
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,800
between you and Xue Zi

578
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,230
to make you so upset.

579
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,520
But please believe me.

580
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,190
She and I are not
cut from the same cloth.

581
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,160
One day,

582
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I will take her down.

583
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,470
When that happens, Snow will be mine.

584
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,830
I'll stand up for you.

585
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,400
Mr. Xue.

586
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,830
You're mistaken.

587
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,470
I don't need you to stand up for me.

588
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,430
I just don't like her, that's all.

589
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,950
Then can you not

590
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,710
dislike me?

591
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,230
I like you.

592
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,040
The production crew had a gathering.

593
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,710
Mr. Xue gave me a ride home.

594
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,110
Let's go back and drink fish soup.

595
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,470
Mr. Wei.

596
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,710
What a coincidence. We meet again.

597
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,710
I think I forgot to check
my horoscope today.

598
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,920
You two got back together?

599
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,040
I suppose I had a hand in that.

600
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,430
That's right.

601
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,310
Thanks to you,

602
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,230
Wei Qing is able to have a long rest.

603
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,830
But rest assured, Mr. Xue.

604
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,160
Once he's rested,

605
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,190
he will certainly take back
what belongs to him.

606
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,070
I hope so.

607
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,590
But don't make me wait too long.

608
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,950
To be honest,

609
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,760
it's a little boring

610
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,430
without Mr. Wei around.

611
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,040
Don't worry.

612
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,000
If you need an opponent,

613
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm here.

614
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,190
I'll be waiting.

615
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,760
You've got the stature now,

616
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,880
Ms. Zhou.

617
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,520
I just can't stand

618
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,880
his obnoxious attitude.

619
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,430
As for you, you better snap out of it.

620
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,590
Knowing how you were before,

621
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,880
you would've snapped at him yourself.

622
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,160
I wouldn't have to step in.

623
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,160
Now that I've been bullied,

624
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,760
will you comfort me
with a goodnight kiss?

625
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,110
Hey.

626
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,350
Here.

627
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,520
Try it.

628
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,190
How is it? Is it good?

629
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,110
Then drink all of it.

630
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,680
I'm going to wash up.

631
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,190
Why did you spit it out?

632
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,160
He didn't remove the gallbladder.

633
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,590
But he made it specially for you.

634
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,560
He wouldn't let anyone drink

635
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,590
and specifically
brought it back for you

636
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,950
because you like fish soup.

637
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,280
When did you start liking fish soup?

638
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,280
I ordered this specially for you.

639
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,710
Herbal chicken soup.

640
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,760
Don't pour it.

641
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,470
It looks greasy. I don't want it.

642
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,760
What do you want then?

643
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,800
Fish soup.

644
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,880
He actually remembered.

645
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,110
Remembered what?

646
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,520
One time, he brought chicken soup
to the set for me.

647
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,000
I purposely said I didn't like it.

648
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,400
I said I liked fish soup.

649
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,350
I didn't expect he'd remember.

650
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,230
Come with me.

651
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,040
I meant to tell you that day.

652
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,920
But you didn't show up.

653
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,110
Now you know the deal.
So what do you think?

654
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,920
I've been thinking about it myself.

655
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,430
During this time,

656
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,110
it's true he's changed a lot.

657
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,310
I can tell he really likes me.

658
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,110
I mean, I scold him every day.

659
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,710
Why would he still like me?

660
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,800
You used to scold Ning Fei
all the time too.

661
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,310
That didn't stop you two from dating.

662
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,000
What's his problem?

663
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,680
Is it Stockholm Syndrome?

664
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,070
What about you?

665
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Do you like him?

666
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,920
I don't know.

667
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,920
I like Ning Fei, that's for sure.

668
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,040
But Xue Ning...

669
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,230
I'm not sure
if it's the current him I like,

670
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,760
or...

671
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,680
I'm just projecting
my feelings for Ning Fei

672
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,280
onto him.

673
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,000
So what if it's like what he said

674
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,880
and he never remembers?

675
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,280
What will you do?

676
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,400
Will you continue to be with him?

677
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,590
Or will you start a new relationship?

678
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,160
(Xue Le)
(Sleep early.)

679
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,310
I do have a new suitor.

680
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,800
But I don't want
to start a new relationship.

681
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,710
Forget about Xue Le. That guy?

682
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,560
He's full of schemes.

683
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,310
You better stay away from him.

684
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,680
I know.

685
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,800
But he invested in my project after all.

686
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,400
I don't want to make things awkward.

687
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,070
At least, let me finish the shoot first.

688
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,230
Still, be careful.

689
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,800
All I want is to marry a rich man.

690
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,640
Then I met an ungrateful cat

691
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,110
and thought he was the one.

692
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,110
When he's ready to get married,

693
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,400
we'll get married.

694
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,950
Who knew

695
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,110
something dramatic

696
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,190
like forgetting his past would happen?

697
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,000
You're lucky.
It's only Wei Qing for you.

698
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,000
Although

699
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,470
he has some little problems,

700
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,590
he treats you well.

701
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,830
So I really hope

702
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,230
you two will be happy together.

703
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,230
I hope so too.

704
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,350
Zhou Shi, tell me what I should do?

705
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,520
Will the ungrateful cat

706
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,560
be able to regain his memory?

707
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,800
Don't worry. He will.

708
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,400
Come in.

709
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,590
Are you ready? I'll call for a cab.

710
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,280
Almost. You can get a cab.

711
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,310
Okay.

712
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,520
Xue Ning.

713
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,350
Thanks for the fish soup

714
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,680
last night.

715
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,920
I just thanked you.

716
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,470
Do you have to be so pleased?

717
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,350
You called me

718
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,950
Xue Ning.

719
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,310
You finally acknowledge me.

720
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,070
I...

721
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,110
Wait here. I'll get the cab.

722
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,880
It's been half a month.

723
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,710
How is Wei Qing now?

724
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,000
He's basically semi-retired.

725
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,430
He spends his days chilling
and shopping like crazy.

726
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,110
With his personality,

727
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,350
Wei Qing wouldn't surrender so quickly.

728
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,920
I think

729
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,920
either he must have something planned,

730
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,230
or he's really taken a big blow

731
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,920
and lost his will.

732
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,880
Which one do you think it is?

733
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,070
I'm not sure.

734
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,110
Whenever I discussed work with him,

735
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,760
he looked disinterested.

736
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,470
Of course, I prefer it
to be the first one.

737
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,710
Do you have any advice, Ms. Xue?

738
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,190
You're his girlfriend.

739
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,040
If you can't think of anything,

740
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,640
what idea can I offer?

741
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,590
You're the only one
who can help Wei Qing.

742
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,190
And I believe you can.

743
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,310
I'll find a way.

744
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,710
I'll go now if there's nothing else.

745
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,320
Who is it?

746
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,520
Bullseye.

747
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,710
I bought a new game. It's really fun.

748
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,870
Come play with me.

749
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,080
What exactly are you planning?

750
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,230
You've experienced tribulations

751
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,840
and have been defeated before.

752
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,000
But you got back on your feet quickly

753
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,560
and turned things around.

754
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,800
But this time?

755
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,870
You hole up at home,

756
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,320
playing games all day long.

757
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,560
You don't seem at all concerned
about the matter.

758
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,120
Have you really given up?

759
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,560
I'm tired.

760
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,280
Since my father passed away,

761
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,080
I've devoted all my time
and energy to Yunma.

762
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
From the moment I opened my eyes,

763
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,600
it was work, work, work every day.

764
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,840
In the end?

765
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,040
I became enemies with my mother.

766
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,670
There wasn't anyone
who I could confide in.

767
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,430
Thank goodness you appeared.

768
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,230
That was the happiest time for me.

769
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,950
I finally had a life

770
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,280
outside of just work.

771
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,800
But then you left.

772
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,600
So I had to go back

773
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,230
to focusing on work, work, and work.

774
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,040
Finally, you came back.

775
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,280
But you started talking about work too.

776
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,600
I'm really exhausted.

777
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,870
I no longer want to live my life

778
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,040
with Yunma as a burden.

779
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,710
I want to live for myself

780
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,360
and for you.

781
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,320
Can't I?

782
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,470
I know you're tired.

783
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,630
But Yunma is the result
of your hard work.

784
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,910
Are you okay
with giving it away like that?

785
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,520
What is it going to take
for you to pull yourself together?

786
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,910
Coming.

787
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,470
Are you really sure?

788
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,430
Mingcheng brought him out to a game.

789
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,560
He won't be home so soon.

790
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,470
Don't worry.

791
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,670
