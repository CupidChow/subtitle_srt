00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,314
same birthday.

169
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:50,395
What kind of strange destiny is this?

170
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:51,675
This means,

171
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:54,154
when you met Li Mingcheng
seven years ago,

172
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,275
he already knew the name "Bi Qiujing", right?

173
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:57,555
Yes.

174
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,835
We exchanged our signatures.

175
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:01,754
He said he liked the name

176
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,034
and he would remember it.

177
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:06,154
I've said "no" so many times.

178
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:07,395
Why wouldn't you believe me?

179
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,275
Tell me which part doesn't work.

180
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,074
Haven't I listed enough reasons?

181
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:12,955
(Listen, you were lucky
that you weren't in Yunma.)

182
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:14,515
(Otherwise, I would have already fired you.)

183
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:16,034
(Then go back to Yunma!)

184
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,515
(And I don't work for you.)

185
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:18,835
(Don't act like a boss in front of me.)

186
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:19,955
(Don't be carried away!)

187
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,034
(Just get used to it.)

188
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:25,474
Ms. Zhou, why did you come out here?

189
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:28,354
If I stay inside,

190
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,795
you'll have to call the emergency number.

191
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:30,555
Pei.

192
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:31,194
Yes.

193
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,115
You kept the scissors and paper cutter, right?

194
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,275
Good job. I thank you
on behalf of my parents

195
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,914
for saving their daughter.

196
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:43,394
Totally unreasonable!

197
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:45,274
Wei An.

198
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:46,875
Tell me, why can't I just be
the CEO of Yunma?

199
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:48,474
Why did I come here to get scolded?

200
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:49,995
Eight hours of happiness.

201
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:50,954
Okay.

202
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:52,755
Fine, I'm wrong.

203
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:54,555
I shouldn't listen to Li Mingcheng.

204
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:57,154
Have a meal together? I'm pissed.

205
00:08:57,594 --> 00:08:58,435
Where is my coffee?

206
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,195
I'm so regretful right now.

207
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,834
Is your boss fine?

208
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,755
Are there any nice restaurants around?

209
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:08,954
My treat.

210
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:10,795
Dinner? Then...

211
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,954
Do we just leave them alone?

212
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:15,315
Leave them alone.

213
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:16,675
That's how they reconcile.

214
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:17,834
Let's go.

215
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:27,635
Aren't there any disposable cups?

216
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:29,714
Use this.

217
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:30,795
Thanks.

218
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:33,795
No need.

219
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,514
I will smash it anyway.

220
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:36,875
Miss Cissy,

221
00:09:37,514 --> 00:09:38,914
can you be more mature?

222
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:40,474
I am mature.

223
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,154
That's why I put the cup on the table,

224
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:43,795
not smash it over your head.

225
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:45,394
Fine.

226
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:46,914
Here it goes again.

227
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:49,514
I'll say it one last time.

228
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,354
We'll use Master Wu Zheng's

229
00:09:51,514 --> 00:09:52,474
well-known landscape collection

230
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,195
in this jewelry collaboration.

231
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:55,115
Stop changing.

232
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:56,435
Is your conclusion

233
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:57,675
supported by data

234
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,315
or is it based on
your subjective assumption?

235
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:00,755
The landscape collection

236
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:02,115
was created more than a decade ago.

237
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:03,875
The true value of Mr. Wu's work

238
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:05,834
is in his groundbreaking.

239
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:07,034
Groundbreaking, and then?

240
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:07,834
Did he succeed?

241
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,115
The reason why it is a classic

242
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,714
is that it's well-known.

243
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,354
Get ten random people from the street.

244
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:13,435
Ask them about Wu Zheng.

245
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:15,675
Nine of them will mention
his landscape painting.

246
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:16,954
This is popularity.

247
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,795
Are you involving the public in art?

248
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:20,195
If you want to please the public,

249
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,315
why don't you hold a talent show?

250
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:22,075
You knew

251
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:22,995
from the first day,

252
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:23,914
I'm a businessman,

253
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,315
not an artist.

254
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,675
I thought you might change,

255
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,834
but I never expected you
to change towards the bad.

256
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:32,075
Well, not as good as you.

257
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:34,195
Go far and enjoy life.

258
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:35,514
Two years have passed.

259
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:37,594
You are more and more like my mother.

260
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,834
Proud and useless.

261
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:40,954
You!

262
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:43,995
Whatever.

263
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:44,954
We can't solve this

264
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:45,714
through communication.

265
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,034
Yes, there's nothing to be
communicated about.

266
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:48,075
We can never say the right thing.

267
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:49,315
We'd better don't meet.

268
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,594
Two years have passed,

269
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,154
and we've become each other's
most hated person.

270
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:02,075
Yes.

271
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:04,474
No wonder you said not to reconcile.

272
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:06,594
I got a question.

273
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:08,555
Two years have passed.

274
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,034
You can't feel the spark

275
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,235
when you see me now, right?

276
00:11:14,235 --> 00:11:15,875
How dare you bring this up?

277
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:19,274
The static electricity is so strong.

278
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:22,154
It might be the dry weather.

279
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:23,195
You...

280
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,914
Why is your static so strong?

281
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:30,435
You too.

282
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,235
Hurry up and think of something.

283
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:38,115
I guess the light bulb is burned out.

284
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:39,435
There is a light bulb

285
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:40,755
in the cabinet next to you.

286
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:48,834
I got a question.

287
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:50,675
If Ning Fei comes back,

288
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:53,394
will you still pay attention to me?

289
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:57,594
I knew it.

290
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,195
You have met Ning Fei.

291
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,354
When is it?

292
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:02,394
Does it matter?

293
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:05,354
Anyway, I know what to do now.

294
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:09,675
What?

295
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,235
Don't mess around. Do you hear me?

296
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:12,834
Both of you, stop messing around.

297
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:15,075
Go to the hotel.

298
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,154
Why save the money?

299
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:18,675
Rubbish.

300
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:21,714
Girl, don't date this kind of guy.

301
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:23,755
You are right.

302
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,435
I'll sort this garbage now.

303
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:26,594
Let's go.

304
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,154
Remember to sort the garbage!

305
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:32,235
Yes.

306
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:34,995
Young people.

307
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:43,354
Do you see the garbage containers?

308
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:46,474
Choose one.

309
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:51,394
Well,

310
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:53,474
I think you are

311
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:55,354
"recyclable waste".

312
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,635
Why?

313
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:59,755
Is it because I'm useful?

314
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:01,995
Of course not.

315
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,714
Because you are "single-use garbage".

316
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,235
Do you have to make me mad?

317
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:08,714
Otherwise, you won't leave.

318
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:12,354
I won't leave anyway.

319
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:13,274
You...

320
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,235
You just never take no as an answer.

321
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:29,675
How about this? Satisfied?

322
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:31,714
You've been happy for eight hours now.

323
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:35,474
Oh, please!

324
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,274
I did my best to please you.

325
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,274
Just let me go.

326
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:43,875
Hey.

327
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:46,714
Do you know how we deal with

328
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,034
non-recyclable items?

329
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:50,675
They will be sent to the factory,
getting crushed

330
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,034
and burnt in an 800-degree furnace.

331
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:54,235
Or get burri...

332
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:55,235
Wait.

333
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:56,875
If you dare to touch Ning,

334
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:58,954
you'll be treated with
one of the three options.

335
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,435
What are you talking about?

336
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:03,594
How could I touch him?

337
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:04,594
You...

338
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:06,834
You are overreacting.

339
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:08,714
You better not touch him.

340
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,914
I can smell his scent on you.

341
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:22,714
Anyway, don't involve the kids.

342
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:25,555
Then, at least we can
still say "see you tomorrow".

343
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:31,435
See you tomorrow.

344
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:44,594
Why did I kiss him?

345
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:46,914
This is never going to end.

346
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:50,594
Kid?

347
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,315
(Meet me at the villa.)

348
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:15,474
Right. These are kids.

349
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:17,115
How is he a kid?

350
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:25,274
What took you so long?

351
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,315
Don't you worry about me?

352
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:28,995
You have no conscience.

353
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:30,834
(I'm taking my words back.)

354
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,315
(He is a kid indeed.)

355
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,315
The villa is huge

356
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:34,954
and you leave me here alone.

357
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,315
Wei, do you have no conscience?

358
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:41,354
You are not alone.

359
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:43,354
The neighbor pays you a visit.

360
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,154
It's tiny. What are you afraid of?
It's adorable.

361
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:56,914
That's why it's scary.

362
00:15:57,195 --> 00:15:58,195
It's so fluffy and tiny.

363
00:15:58,315 --> 00:15:59,594
What if I stepped on it

364
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:01,354
when it's circling my feet?

365
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:04,195
I'm warning you.

366
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:05,875
Take it away from me in ten seconds.

367
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:06,995
Otherwise,

368
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:08,914
I can't promise what I will do to you.

369
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:10,675
What could you do to me?

370
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:11,795
I...

371
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:13,675
I'll turn into a beast.

372
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,154
I didn't take my medicine in two days.

373
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:17,195
I might...

374
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:20,354
Sorry!

375
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:30,195
Are you sure it's locked?

376
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:31,635
Will it escape?

377
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,195
Well, it depends.

378
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:34,354
Let me ask you.

379
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,394
You said you were taking medicine.

380
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:38,115
What is it?

381
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:39,274
That's none of...

382
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:46,755
The medication to control my mood.

383
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:48,594
To help with my overthinking.

384
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:50,474
Why?

385
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,274
A thoughtless person like you

386
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:53,755
will overthink.

387
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:56,115
That's not very convincing.

388
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,675
Can you take me as a person?

389
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:01,795
Is this something I can control?

390
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,795
Now and then, these memories

391
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,435
come into my head.

392
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:07,675
My head hurts

393
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:08,834
when I think about them.

394
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,514
My sister loves me.

395
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:12,994
She gets me some medicine
from the hospital.

396
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:16,355
That's quite effective.

397
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:18,835
Just one pill and I can sleep like a baby.

398
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:19,955
And

399
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:21,715
I don't remember the past too.

400
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:23,994
(It seems like)

401
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:27,394
(his memory loss
is related to the medication.)

402
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:31,835
One more piece of memory

403
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:33,715
means one more choice for you.

404
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,715
Why did you suppress it?

405
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:36,715
What do you mean?

406
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:38,154
You are doing great now.

407
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:39,955
But have you ever thought

408
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,754
that maybe you had more things back then?

409
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:44,914
Don't you feel sorry for forgetting

410
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:48,555
those who were important to you?

411
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:59,114
It's just a bowl.

412
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:01,754
You can buy it everywhere.

413
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:03,754
Get lost!

414
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:06,475
It's not up to me

415
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,435
to decide what I can remember.

416
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:10,195
Sometimes, your dream

417
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:12,475
is a reflection of your subconscious.

418
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:14,435
Your dream

419
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,114
might be a key to your past.

420
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,754
That's so much trouble.

421
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:28,355
Why don't you just tell me?

422
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:30,754
You wish.

423
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:32,675
Do you think I live under your bed?

424
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:34,274
Well, you have to recall

425
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:35,795
the details by yourself.

426
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,034
The problem is that girl is unpredictable.

427
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,075
Today,

428
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:45,914
I broke a bowl

429
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:47,315
and she chased me out.

430
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,315
That's ridiculous.

431
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,114
What's with that face?

432
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:57,555
You broke the bowl?

433
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,075
I guess you'd better not remember.

434
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,154
Why?

435
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:04,514
I'm afraid you might strangle yourself

436
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:06,114
if you remember.

437
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:09,154
It's just a bowl.

438
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,195
Ouch!

439
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,075
You little brat.

440
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:17,555
Why did you break the bowl?

441
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:19,154
Oh, dear.

442
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:20,955
I request assistance with my memory.

443
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:26,315
I'll leave that to you.

444
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:31,754
Fine.

445
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:34,754
Come on, it's just a bowl.

446
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:36,475
I will recall it.

447
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:55,154
It's just a bowl.

448
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:56,914
Why are you overreacting?

449
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:00,634
(I'll give you the money.)

450
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,675
Get the exact same bowl for me

451
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:06,435
(or I'll call the police.)

452
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:09,234
(Fine, we are not done yet.)

453
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:11,394
It's just a bowl! I'll pay you.

454
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:12,795
I don't need your money.

455
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,795
I can buy you an identical one.

456
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,355
The 107th.

457
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,475
This is the best I can get.

458
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:20,914
It's yours now.

459
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:22,435
Drop it or smash it, it's up to you.

460
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:24,114
You can vent on it.

461
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:25,514
There's no need to compensate.

462
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,595
That's it?

463
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,914
I've been trying so hard to recall
and that's all?

464
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:32,514
Gosh.

465
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:35,154
I can't fall asleep.

466
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:40,475
What's exactly

467
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,234
in that box?

468
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:29,795
Sleeping alone in such a huge villa.

469
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,475
That's a pity.

470
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:34,754
Don't mind me.

471
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:36,355
I am a man too. I know.

472
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:37,394
Please proceed.

473
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:44,955
Who let you get on my bed?

474
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:46,675
Get off.

475
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:47,514
Get off.

476
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:48,355
Why did you beat me?

477
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:49,555
Get off.

478
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:01,914
Boss.

479
00:23:07,195 --> 00:23:08,114
Boss.

480
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:13,914
Where is she?

481
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,170
(Wei Heng, Chairperson of Yunma Group)

482
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:40,475
You are here.

483
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:46,355
Yes.

484
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:52,154
Why didn't you make a sound?

485
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,034
I thought there was a thief.

486
00:23:55,355 --> 00:23:56,595
If that's the case,

487
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:58,274
the thief must be after you.

488
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:00,315
The most valuable thing in this house

489
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:02,075
is you.

490
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,914
By the way, it's late at night,

491
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:06,195
what I can do for you?

492
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,555
Xue Ning's medicine

493
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:11,555
and

494
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,114
a doctor I know recommended an ointment,

495
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:16,114
it's effective for your hands' recovery.

496
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:19,034
Boss.

497
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:20,315
Don't misunderstand me.

498
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:24,034
I'm afraid your speed is too slow
and would affect our work progress.

499
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:26,195
You are absolutely right.

500
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:28,034
I'm fine either way.

501
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:29,555
Just be nice to Ning.

502
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:30,835
No matter how nice I treat him,

503
00:24:31,634 --> 00:24:33,595
you guys will still go to Wei Qing.

504
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:35,835
Wei Qing and I are merely colleagues.

505
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:38,075
"You guys"?

506
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:40,394
You mean, Ning...

507
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:41,835
He lived in Wei Qing's house,

508
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,595
don't you know?

509
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:46,315
Stop calling him.

510
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:48,394
They might be sleeping
on the same bed now.

511
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:49,435
What?

512
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:50,914
He just took him in.

513
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:53,075
But Wei Qing can't seem to win you back,

514
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:55,154
and Xue Ning has no shame,

515
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:56,835
maybe...

516
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,274
I'll make him move out tomorrow.

517
00:24:58,994 --> 00:24:59,835
Great.

518
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:02,114
Boss,

519
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:04,555
I always wanted to ask this.

520
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,195
You care so much about Wei Qing.

521
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:07,955
Why is it...

522
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,435
Because I hate him,

523
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:11,195
and I want him to die.

524
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,075
I don't get it.

525
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,994
Both of you are equally strong,

526
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:18,514
you can always work together.

527
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:20,475
We are equally strong,

528
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:23,154
that's why it's either him or me.

529
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,715
You can always ask him

530
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,475
if he is willing to work with me.

531
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:34,754
Impossible.

532
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:35,955
Why?

533
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,234
There's no reason.

534
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:39,514
If you want a reason,

535
00:25:42,595 --> 00:25:43,634
our fates violate each other.

536
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:45,715
Headache.

537
00:25:46,475 --> 00:25:48,075
Both of you are fighting drastically,

538
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:50,435
but have you ever thought of
a middleman like me?

539
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,075
If you feel wronged,

540
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,595
you can always come to my company.

541
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:04,075
No.

542
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:06,715
End of topic. Over.

543
00:26:06,994 --> 00:26:08,154
Why?

544
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:11,234
Mr. Wei, let's focus on work.

545
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:22,475
I got a question. As a boss,

546
00:26:22,634 --> 00:26:24,355
how am I not as good as Xue Zi?

547
00:26:24,595 --> 00:26:26,234
She can go to the toilet with me.

548
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:28,675
We can shop for lingerie,

549
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,874
go for a facial and spa.

550
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:31,514
Even our menstrual cycles are similar.

551
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:32,675
When I'm on my period,

552
00:26:32,795 --> 00:26:34,595
she can lend me her sanitary pads.

553
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:36,595
Can you?

554
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,234
Are those your reasons?

555
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:40,075
If you can hate Xue Zi for no reason,

556
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,475
why can't these be my reasons?

557
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,195
I can do that too.

558
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:45,994
When is your next period?

559
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:47,675
Why should I tell you?

560
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:49,114
Do I know you?

561
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:57,754
What's wrong?

562
00:26:57,914 --> 00:26:58,874
Don't come near me.

563
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,754
I can answer

564
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:07,914
your question now.

565
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:09,754
The next menstrual cycle

566
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:12,355
is now.

567
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:18,234
You...

568
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,595
Are you on your period now?

569
00:27:21,754 --> 00:27:22,874
Cut the crap.

570
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:24,955
Didn't you say you could do it?

571
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:27,154
I guess you know

572
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:28,394
what sanitary products to buy.

573
00:27:28,555 --> 00:27:30,274
How would I know?

574
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:34,475
Didn't you say we are not close?

575
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:36,914
Well, I can help.

576
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:38,595
But first, answer me.

577
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:41,595
Who is more important? Xue Zi or me?

578
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:45,955
You!

579
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:47,034
Okay?

580
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,914
Why don't you just say this
in the first place?

581
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:52,234
Wait here.

582
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:13,034
I'm in the supermarket. What do you want?

583
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:15,114
What would I want?

584
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:16,555
Go in there,

585
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:18,274
straight to the sanitary zone.

586
00:28:18,555 --> 00:28:20,514
Put the sanitary products in the basket.

587
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,475
If you can't find it,

588
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:23,715
ask the salesperson.

589
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,940
(Adult diaper)

590
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,380
(Adult diaper)

591
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,715
You took your own sweet time,

592
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,195
and this is what you buy.

593
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:46,675
Well, it's not exactly the same,

594
00:28:46,955 --> 00:28:49,914
but in terms of structure and usage,

595
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:51,835
90% of the product
is similar to what you need.

596
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:53,994
How about the remaining 10%?

597
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:56,715
Do you mind explaining

598
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:58,795
why you bought adult diapers?

599
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:00,274
And it's L size.

600
00:29:02,994 --> 00:29:03,914
The salesperson took the wrong size.

601
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:05,435
Can't you get another one?

602
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:08,195
The salesperson went all the way
to the warehouse,

603
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:09,555
I felt bad to get another one.

604
00:29:12,754 --> 00:29:14,475
Can you just use it for now?

605
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:16,795
I must be out of my mind
to trust you in this.

606
00:29:20,874 --> 00:29:22,234
Are you going to the restroom?

607
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:23,514
Do you want me to help you?

608
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:24,715
No need.

609
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:29,234
The restroom is far away.

610
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:30,274
I have a way

611
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,075
to get you there without getting up.

612
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:33,114
What is it?

613
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:34,994
(Is he going to carry me in his arms?)

614
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,570
(RESTROOM)

615
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:46,195
Turn around.

616
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:53,795
What are you doing?

617
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:00,994
Look at you.

618
00:30:01,154 --> 00:30:02,475
You stained your clothes, so what?

619
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:07,874
What are you doing?

620
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,234
Send you home.

621
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:11,274
Home? Then why do you carry me
in your arms?

622
00:30:11,514 --> 00:30:13,234
You seem to be looking forward to it.

623
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:14,595
Who?

624
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:15,675
Put me down.

625
00:30:15,835 --> 00:30:16,715
Don't move.

626
00:30:17,075 --> 00:30:19,274
Otherwise, if we fall and kiss by accident,

627
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:20,514
I'm not going to
take responsibility for that.

628
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:34,075
Is this place close to your house?

629
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:36,315
Since we are going to
pass by your house,

630
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:37,675
let's go to your house then.

631
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:38,634
My house?

632
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,715
No?

633
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:42,394
Why?

634
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,394
No.

635
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:45,475
I adopted a stray dog recently.

636
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:00,355
Wei An,

637
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:01,675
I'm having a guest at home.

638
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:02,795
Send the stray dog

639
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:03,994
to the veterinary clinic for now.
