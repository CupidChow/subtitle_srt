18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,760
Why isn't he back yet?

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,720
Do you think Xue Zi
did something to him?

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,680
Don't worry.

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Xue Zi doesn't know

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,190
that Fei is Xue Ning.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,080
So I don't think
she'll suspect anything.

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,120
If you're worried, I can go take a look.

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
He's back.

26
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,670
I promised Fei

27
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,360
not to get in your way again.

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,830
I wish you two happiness.

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Thank you.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
I've retracted
the copyright of Fei's work.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
I hope you won't hate me for that.

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,630
You needn't worry, Ms. Xue.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
I've never regarded the copyright

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,080
as mine anyway.

35
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,110
I was just keeping it
for him temporarily.

36
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,240
Naturally, letting the company
deal with the copyright

37
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,440
is more worthwhile
than it being in my possession.

38
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,550
As a member of Snow, I'm glad

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,800
that the company managed to sign

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,550
such a talented artist.

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,360
Can we leave now?

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,270
Sure you can.

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,470
Zhou Shi, see them out.

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,550
Alright.

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,240
How was it?

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,080
Did Xue Zi notice anything?

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
Then we'll proceed
with the original plan.

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,110
You guys go home. I won't see you off.

49
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,800
Come to our place after work.

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
We have to celebrate.

51
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,110
Hotpot and beer. Drink till we drop.

52
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,240
I can't tonight.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm meeting a landlord
to look at a house.

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,360
Look at a house?

55
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,670
Are you moving out of Wei Qing's house?

56
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,360
The last time we drank,

57
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,030
I thought you two had cleared the air.

58
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,440
Are you still angry with him?

59
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,910
I know he kept things from me

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,190
in order to protect me.

61
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,800
But he always does this.

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,240
He makes a mistake, he apologizes
and then he does it again.

63
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,080
So this time,

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,750
I'm not planning
to forgive him just yet.

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,600
That will teach him well.

66
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,800
Nothing is scarier than a woman scorned.

67
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,800
Poor Wei Qing.

68
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,030
Listen, kid. Choose your side correctly.

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,550
If you do anything bad,

70
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,360
I'll sort you out too.

71
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,520
Anyway, you don't have to find a place.

72
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,030
You can just move back in with us.

73
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,550
Sure, in the past.

74
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,240
But now,

75
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,030
I rather not be the third wheel,

76
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,880
getting in the way of you two.

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,470
We're already stuck together.

78
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,600
You won't get between us so easily.

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,720
Besides, if you come back,

80
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,720
we won't have to get takeout every day.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,030
You...

82
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,550
Do you expect me
to cook for you for free?

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,160
Just returning to old business.

84
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,640
Yeah, Zhou Shi.

85
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,920
I haven't had
your cooking in a long time.

86
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,550
Okay?

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,830
You guys go back first.

88
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,670
I'll see you tonight.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,830
We'll be waiting at home.

90
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,950
- See you tonight.
- Bye.

91
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
Why is he so late?

92
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,230
Why isn't he back yet?

93
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,725
(Lin Feifei)

94
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,720
Hey, Feifei.

95
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,230
(Why aren't you here yet?)

96
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,350
Because Wei Qing

97
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,110
isn't home yet. Wait till I...

98
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,670
(Zhou Shi?)

99
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,550
Give me a minute. I'll call you back.

100
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,620
Hello?

101
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,000
Hey.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,760
Where are you?

103
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,070
Working in the office.

104
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,480
When did Yunma
start doing mobile office?

105
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,600
What?

106
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,720
Next time you bluff,
remember to stay out of sight.

107
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,670
Come inside.

108
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,040
I want to talk to you.

109
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,040
How long have you been back?

110
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,550
Less than two hours.

111
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,950
Why didn't you come in
when you're already back?

112
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,830
I worried you might still be angry

113
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,110
and get annoyed by me.

114
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,200
So I decided to stay outside
to check the situation.

115
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
Childish.

116
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,600
Where are you going?

117
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,880
I talked to Feifei.

118
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm moving back in with her.

119
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,920
I've been waiting for you
to inform you.

120
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,160
Am I not allowed to move out?

121
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,390
It's already so late.

122
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,040
Don't drive.

123
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,670
I'll drive you there.

124
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,270
(He's not stopping me?)

125
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,040
(Guess I don't matter.)

126
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,670
No need. I can manage.

127
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,670
Wait.

128
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,200
You picked this out after considering it
for three days.

129
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,070
You like using it. Take it with you.

130
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,670
And the robot vacuum.

131
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,000
Take it with you too.

132
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,320
(You won't have to clean yourself then.)

133
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,830
(Also,)

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,480
(I'll get the bed
delivered to you tomorrow.)

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,000
(You said after sleeping in that bed,)

136
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,000
(you won't be able
to sleep on another, right?)

137
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
(And the humidifier too.)

138
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,320
(Take it along.
It's good for your skin.)

139
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,950
And that potted plant.

140
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,880
You said it was pretty, right?

141
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
And...

142
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,350
That's all I can think of.

143
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,920
What about you?

144
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,440
Is there anything else you want?

145
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,440
No.

146
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,720
What are you doing?

147
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,480
I'm wrapping myself up.

148
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,950
If you need me,

149
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,320
you can take me too.

150
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,600
Wei Qing.

151
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,670
Okay, I'm just joking.

152
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,830
It's fine

153
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,550
if you won't take me along.

154
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,230
But those things,

155
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,790
you should take them.

156
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,070
Even if you're living somewhere else,

157
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,440
I don't want you to be uncomfortable.

158
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,720
Actually,

159
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,760
I don't have to leave right now.

160
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,270
But I have a condition.

161
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,110
I'll give you
an observation period of ten days.

162
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,390
It will come down to your performance.

163
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,640
Deal.

164
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,110
Good Roommate Agreement?

165
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,960
One, while in a professional setting,

166
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,760
we will be business rivals.

167
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,520
Outside of it, we will be roommates.

168
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,960
There mustn't be
excessive physical contact.

169
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,400
Two.

170
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,670
Both parties have to respect each other.

171
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,000
If you have any opinions regarding work
or personal life,

172
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,280
you may give suggestions,

173
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,880
but you must not interfere.

174
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,710
What?

175
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,710
You don't accept?

176
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,710
No. I just think

177
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,110
there can be some amendments.

178
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,590
That won't do.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,110
I'm the only one
who can amend the agreement.

180
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,350
If you won't accept...

181
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
Third.

(Wei Qing's Flaws)

183
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,840
Zhou Shi has the right
to supervise Wei Qing

184
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,320
(Arrogant, controlling, too many exes)
in correcting the following flaws,

185
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,350
until Zhou Shi is satisfied.

186
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,710
Wei Qing is not allowed to complain.

187
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,350
I didn't think you'd keep this.

These were all my complaints.

189
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,640
Whatever you said, I will change.

190
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,520
Hopefully one day, the things written
in this book

191
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,350
will all be my good points,

192
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,880
and not my flaws.

193
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,350

May I know

201

when you'll start
exercising your authority?

202

You can start off

203

by unpacking my luggage.

204
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,350
Yes, ma'am.

The colors.

210
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,280
Not bad. You've improved.

211
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,640
See if it's good.

212
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,840
It's good.

213
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,230
If you're happy with it,

214
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,590
please give me a stamp.

215
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,880
What's this?

216
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,760
Satisfaction survey.

217
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,320
Every time you think I did well,

218
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,590
and you're pleased,
then give me a stamp.

219
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,230
After accumulating ten,
I can get a reward.

220
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,320
What reward?

221
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,230
You can decide.

222
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,110
This is so childish.

223
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,760
You're not a 5-year-old.

224

Do you really need a ribbon
for good performance?

225

I won't do it.

Please give me a reward.

227
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,200
Think of it as encouragement.

228
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,520
Mr. Wei, you're already in your 30s.

229
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,320
Shouldn't you act like a proper adult?

230
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,590
Happy now?

(Satisfaction Survey
of Wei Qing's Transformation for Love)

232

Yes. Let's eat.

233

Master Wu?

234
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,670
Pei.

235
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,550
Ms. Zhou.

236
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,350
Was that Master Wu?

237
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,280
Yes.

238
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,590
Why is he here?

239
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,110
He said he wanted to work with us
on an exhibition.

240
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,670
When did this happen?

241
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Why haven't I heard?

242
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,710
I only just found out myself.

243
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,960
Ms. Xue asked me to be in charge.

244
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,640
Didn't she inform you?

245
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,710
No.

246
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,150
Ms. Xue asked you to follow up?

247
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,280
Yes. Ms. Xue asked me
to follow up on the matter.

248
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,880
That came as a surprise.

249
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,910
Because I don't have any experience.

250
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,150
Alright, got it.

251
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,230
You go ahead.

252
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,760
Come in.

253
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,790
Did Ms. Xue ask you to come?

254
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,080
No, I came on my own.

255
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,350
I wish to clarify some things with you.

256
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,230
Are you going to ask me

257
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,640
why I'm working with Ms. Xue?

258
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,470
Yes. Regarding the contract
for the biennial,

259
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,110
it was actually
tampered with by Shangjue,

260
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,080
a subsidiary of Snow.

261
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,230
We told you about it.

262
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,880
You've also seen the proof.

263
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,400
I don't quite understand

264
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,280
why you've decided
to work with Snow again.

265
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,230
You're an employee at Snow.

266
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,320
Shouldn't you be happy

267
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,150
that I'm working with Snow?

268
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,840
Of course, I am.

269
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,470
I just want to check

270
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,470
if you've agreed on the conditions.

271
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,150
You need not worry about that.

272
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,110
I couldn't say no
to what Ms. Xue offered me.

273
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,200
And what's that?

274
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,200
I don't think that concerns you.

275
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,200
Excuse me, but I'm busy.

276
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,350
Please don't interrupt me.

277
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,200
Ms. Xue.

278
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,520
Ms. Zhou went to see Master Wu just now.

279
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,200
Okay, got it.

280
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,910
Come in.

281
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,110
Have a seat.

282
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,550
Is anything the matter?

283
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,910
Ms. Xue.

284
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,640
Why wasn't I informed

285
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,230
of the partnership with Master Wu?

286
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,030
It happened out of the blue.

287
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,760
After the biennial,

288
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,470
I've been wanting to approach Master Wu

289
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,000
to mend our relationship.

290
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,840
At the time, Wei Qing was in a pickle.

291
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,880
You were busy taking care of him.

292
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,760
So I didn't want
to burden you with this matter.

293
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,150
I get it.

294
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,440
Don't worry, Ms. Xue.

295
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,470
I won't let
my relationship with Wei Qing

296
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,710
affect my work.

297
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,590
If you're still concerned,

298
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,230
I can give up my shares at Snow.

299
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,960
Why would I be concerned?

300
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,280
I also have shares at Yunma.

301
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,670
We're considered partners.

302
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,710
Don't think too much.

303
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,440
I thought I had done something wrong

304
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,080
and made you feel disappointed.

305
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,640
But, Ms. Xue,

306
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,470
after the fiasco with the biennial,

307
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,230
Master Wu had declined
all meetings with us.

308
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,440
How did you persuade him?

309
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,030
Unrelenting will, I suppose.

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,550
Anyway, I didn't put you in charge
of Wu Zheng's project

311
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,550
because I didn't want you to feel bad
about what happened.

312
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,080
Another reason
is also because he requested it.

313
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,030
Okay.

314
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,520
Ms. Xue has considered everything.

315
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,080
I will do as told then.

316
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,840
Pei is inexperienced.

317
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,040
Guide her well.

318
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,520
Rest assured. I can do that.

319
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,760
I'll be going if there's nothing else.

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,800
Call me if anything.

321
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,590
Okay.

Sorry about that.

324
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,920
I didn't mean it.

325
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,000
What's wrong?

326
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,920
You've been out of sorts

since coming home today.

328
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,430
Something to do with work?

329
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,000
Is it something confidential
you can't talk about?

330
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,470
But if you don't tell me, you worry

331
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,280
that Snow will have the upper hand?

332
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,950
I like it
when you're all worried about me.

333
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,590
Watch your attitude.

334
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,830
A roommate
should keep the proper distance.

337
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,800
So the thing you've been indecisive

338
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,280
on whether or not you should tell me

339
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,640
is that Wu Zheng
is partnering with Snow.

340
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,950
You already know?

341
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
I only found out about it
at the meeting.

342
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,110
Looks like Xue Zi no longer trusts me.

343
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,280
I didn't get wind of it at all.

344
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,430
Perhaps

345
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,520
she's never trusted me.

346
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,920
You're in an awkward position.

347
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,560
You're stuck in the whirlpool
of the two companies' battle.

348
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,350
You can't side with either side.

349
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,880
So,

350
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,830
just go to work as usual.

351
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,560
No need to worry too much, got it?

352
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,430
So,

353
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,110
your response to Snow's plan
is to do an exhibition

354
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,520
and compete with Xue Zi head-on?

355
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,830
It's not entirely head-on.

356
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,950
When the biennial fell through

357
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,280
and I was battling it out with Shangjue,

358
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,590
I purposely let slip.

359
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,350
It was magnified by the media.

360
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,110
It's about time Yunma did something

361
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,950
to restore its public reputation.

362
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,590
But does Yunma
have the right artworks to allow them

363
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,040
to compete with Wu Zheng?

364
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,310
If only I hadn't transferred

365
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,880
Fei's copyright to Xue Zi.

366
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,710
His work could have put up a fight.

367
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,160
Come on.

368
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,110
I'll show you my secret weapon.

369
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,310
This is...

370
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,160
It's Shan He's work.

371
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,640
What do you think our chances are
if we use his work

372
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,830
against Wu Zheng's?

373
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,560
It's totally fine.

374
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,760
Shan He is a legend in the art world.

375
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,350
His circumstances
are similar to Van Gogh's.

376
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,310
He was a nobody when alive
but gained sudden fame posthumously.

377
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,280
Every piece of his
is worth tens of millions.

378
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,280
But very few make it to the market.

379
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,470
This...

380
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,680
Where did you get it?

381
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,070
He was a close friend of my dad.

382
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,560
Before he passed, he entrusted

383
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,190
all his work to my dad.

384
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,680
Why haven't you told me about it before?

385
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,800
I did, many times.

386
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,310
I didn't just mention it,

387
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,590
you're also good friends with his son.

388
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,160
His son?

389
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,800
Shan He's real name

390
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,590
is Ning Yuanhao.

391
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,040
Fei is Shan He's son?

392
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,230
How could you not tell me

393
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,000
such an important thing?

394
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,400
You never asked.

395
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,880
Wait.

396
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,070
Does Fei know that his dad's paintings

397
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,040
are with you?

398
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,310
Of course, he does.

399
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,400
My father's last wish

400
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,070
is for me to return all the art pieces

401
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,520
to Ning Fei.

402
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,880
After you went to study abroad,

403
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,400
I actually spoke to him about it.

404
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
But he thinks

405
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,680
it's better to let me keep

406
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,760
the art pieces for now.

407
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,230
Moreover,

408
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,470
he was the one who suggested

409
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,070
using the paintings for the exhibition.

410
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,830
He did?

411
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,880
He's also the one

412
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,560
who told me that Snow

413
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,070
is going to do an exhibition
with Wu Zheng.

414
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,070
He then suggested
that I use Mr. Ning's artworks

415
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,950
to fight with Wu Zheng's artworks.

416
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,070
Actually,

417
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,800
I've been wanting to do
an exhibition for Mr. Ning.

418
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,830
This happens to be a good chance.

419
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:44,950
What is it?

420
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,230
Is something wrong?

421
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,230
No.

422
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,160
(Why did you agree)

423
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,350
(to let Wei Qing do an exhibition
with your dad's artworks?)

424
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,680
(Ning Fei)
(I have my own plan.)

425
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,880
(Don't worry.
Everything is under control.)

426
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Excuse me, young hero. Are you looking

427
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,800
for a girlfriend that looks like me?

428
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,040
My foot...

429
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,430
Mr. Director.

430
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes?

431
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,520
I've been here all afternoon.

432
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,040
I know the lines by heart.

433
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,350
When is it my turn?

434
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,470
Who are you auditioning for?

435
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,160
The third female role, Song Xianyue.

436
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,190
Song Xianyue?

437
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,710
We have already found Song Xianyue.

438
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,040
No one informed you?

439
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,470
It's set?

440
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,230
I wasn't told.

441
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,350
Alright, you can go.

442
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,950
Okay? We'll get in touch
if another role comes up.

443
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,760
Sir!

444
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,560
Are there any other roles
that are still open?

445
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,400
I really like this drama.

446
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,310
Could you give me another chance?

447
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,800
There's a special arrangement.

448
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,760
But the role has some racy scenes

449
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,640
towards the end.

450
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,430
I'm not sure if you're okay with it.

451
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,880
How racy?

452
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,000
There's a bath scene
showing the naked back,

453
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,800
and two forced perspective love scenes.

454
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,680
That's...

455
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,560
It's okay.

456
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,880
You can think about it.

457
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,160
Call us if you're ready.

458
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,160
Okay, thank you, sir.

459
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,760
Feifei.

460
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,040
Mr. Xue.

461
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,280
What are you doing here?

462
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
I came to visit you.

463
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,310
I heard you've been auditioning nonstop.

464
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,710
As an actor,

465
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,430
going to auditions is part of the job.

466
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,950
I heard it hasn't been going well.

467
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,950
Feifei.

468
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,350
Stop going to those auditions.

469
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,470
Take a break at home for now.

470
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,110
I'm just experiencing
some temporary financial setbacks.

471
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,830
Once I resolve the matter,

472
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,400
I will inject the funds immediately.

473
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,680
You can continue being the female lead.

474
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,760
There's no need.

475
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,430
Mr. Xue.

476
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,920
I have to prepare
for my audition tomorrow.

477
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,070
I won't keep you.

478
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,520
I'm sincere about you.

479
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,920
I won't give up.

480
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,470
Please give me another chance.

481
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,400
Mr. Xue.

482
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,190
Previously, I had signed a contract
with the crew.

483
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,880
So while on the job,

484
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,920
I cannot avoid interacting with you.

485
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,760
But now,

486
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,110
you're no longer my boss.

487
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,760
So please stop pestering me.

488
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,280
Let go.

489
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,830
Feifei.

490
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,070
Who are you?

491
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,590
What do you want from Feifei?

492
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,640
What's your problem, Xue Ning?

493
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm not Xue Ning.

494
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,470
I'm Ning Fei.

495
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,070
Ning Fei?

496
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,280
You've really recovered?

497
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
Mr. Xue, allow me
to introduce him to you.

498
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,230
This is my boyfriend, Ning Fei.

499
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,430
Thank you

500
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,680
for all that you've done for me.

501
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,800
In the future,

502
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,400
we won't have to meet again.

503
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,430
Let's go home.

504
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,310
What's wrong with your leg?

505
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,000
I accidentally sprained it.

506
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,230
What are you doing?

507
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,800
No one can snatch you away
if I'm carrying you.

508
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,560
Put me down!

509
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:38,475
(Xue Zi)

510
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,680
Wei Qing and the rest?

511
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
They don't know
that Ning Fei is faking it.

512
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,400
Don't worry.

513
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,310
Also,

514
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,430
don't ask me to do such things again.

515
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,560
I can do it myself.

516
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,160
Don't move. Soak them first.

517
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,110
I'll give you a massage later.

518
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,310
Is the water temperature okay?

519
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,190
The wildcat has had enough of wandering.

520
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,640
Now he's become so obedient.

521
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,190
The wildcat can become naughty too.

522
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,160
You... What are you doing?

523
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,230
Sit up.

524
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,110
Memorize your lines.

525
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,800
I'll give you a massage.

526
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,000
There's something I want to tell you.

527
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,110
I might have to do a few racy scenes

528
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,760
towards the end of the show.

529
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,950
Racy, how?

530
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
A naked back bath scene,

531
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,680
and two

532
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,560
forced perspective love scenes.

533
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
No way.

534
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,470
Why?

535
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,160
I'm an actor. This is acting.

536
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,110
Yes, you're an actor.

537
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,110
But at the same time,
you're also my girlfriend.

538
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,000
So those scenes

539
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,110
are no go.

540
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,830
You little brat.

541
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,880
I know you care a lot about me.

542
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,640
But I learned a fact

543
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,950
from Xue Le.

544
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,800
I can't bet my future

545
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,430
on someone else.

546
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,760
If I have to rely on others

547
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,190
on getting the roles I want,

548
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,160
then what's the point of being an actor?

549
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,880
Everything can fail you,

550
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,560
except for true skills.

551
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,880
Did you know?

552
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,160
My dream has always been
to be an actor.

553
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,880
So this time,

554
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,590
I want to get the role

555
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,950
with my own ability.

556
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,280
Can you guarantee

557
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,880
that it's forced perspective?

558
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,280
I guarantee it will be
forced perspective.

559
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,000
Alright then.

560
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Let's agree on this.

561
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,040
I have to be present during the shoot.

562
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,160
Sure, you jealous little cat.

563
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,110
Come, let's continue with the massage.

564
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,760
And you continue reading the lines.

Bye-bye.

578
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,070
Congratulations, Mr. Wei.

579
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,560
Ms. Xue asked me

580
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,760
to pass you the congratulatory gift.

581
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,110
On behalf of Snow,

582
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,070
I wish you great success
with the exhibition.

583
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,880
How courteous of you
to bring me a gift.

584
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,350
Okay. Then please,

585
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,470
tell Ms. Xue

586
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,800
I said thanks.

587
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,160
So fake.

588
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,950
I thought Xue Zi would be here herself.

589
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,190
She probably hasn't arrived.

590
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,430
She should be here soon.

591
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,830
Zhou Shi.

592
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Why is it only you three?
Where's Ning Fei?

593
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,000
I haven't seen him since morning.

594
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,880
Mr. Wei,
Mr. Chen and the others are here.

595
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,920
Come with me to greet them.

596
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,190
Li Mingcheng, take care of the guests.

597
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,190
Okay.

598
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,160
I'll be right back.

599
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,520
Darling.

600
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm going to work.

601
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,400
Go on.

602
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,110
See you, Feifei.

603
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,040
Feeling nervous?

604
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,950
Why should I feel nervous?

605
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,310
I'm a professional.

606
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,920
Since you're so confident,

607
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,110
I'll wait for you there then.

608
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,560
Don't worry.

609
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,310
Action.

610
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,520
Where were you?

611
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,640
I touched up my makeup.

612
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,430
I have to put forward my best.

613
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,400
Very professional.

614
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,680
Let's go. It's starting.

615
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,190
Welcome, everyone,

616
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
to The Forgotten Master exhibition.

617
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
The artist whose work is being showcased
is called Shan He.

618
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,880
(The Forgotten Master)
He was my father's dear friend.

619
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,430
Being able to organize
this exhibition for him

620
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,880
is my way of fulfilling
my late father's wish.

621
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,310
Committing larceny
in order to put on the exhibition.

622
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,880
Is that also Mr. Wei Heng's last wish?

623
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,470
I don't quite get your meaning, Ms. Xue.

624
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,400
What do you mean
by "committing larceny"?

625
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,470
Shan He's real name is Ning Yuanhao.

626
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,640
He was indeed Mr. Wei Heng's
close friend.

627
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,710
The two created many artworks.

628
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,280
And Mr. Ning fully trusted Mr. Wei Heng.

629
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,310
He entrusted his works

630
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,710
to Wei Heng to be managed on his behalf.

631
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,680
But he didn't expect

632
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,710
Wei Heng to secretly put his own name

633
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,800
on his artworks

634
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,560
and claim them for himself.

635
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,520
Nonsense!

636
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,640
Xue Zi, how dare you defame my father?

637
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,950
I'm not making this up.

638
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,350
All the proceedings were recorded

639
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,040
in Mr. Ning's personal diary.

640
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,640
This diary contains detailed records

641
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,190
of how Wei Heng deceived everyone

642
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,040
and stole Mr. Ning's artworks.

643
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,880
I will release it to the public

644
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,230
when the time is right.

645
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,470
After Mr. Ning's passing,

646
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,000
his artworks
should have gone to his son,

647
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,920
Ning Fei, who is also an artist.

648
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,710
But Wei Qing took them unlawfully.

649
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,160
Ning Fei had personally asked me

650
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,800
to take care of the artworks.

651
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,230
I organized this exhibition

652
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,280
after getting his permission.

653
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,230
Is that so?

654
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,230
Is there a contract?

655
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,680
Ning Fei.

656
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,920
Aren't you going to say anything?

657
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,880
All these years,

658
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,520
I've been searching

659
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,350
for the paintings my father left behind.

660
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,680
If you hadn't put on this show,

661
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,560
I wouldn't have known
that all my father's artworks

662
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,160
were in your hands.

663
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,640
Wei Qing.

664
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,190
You've unlawfully kept
my father's artworks

665
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,800
for many years now.

666
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,110
Isn't it about time to give them back?

667
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,920
Ning Fei, what...

668
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,680
You're Xue Ning.

669
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,760
They came prepared.

670
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,840
It's best we avoid direct confrontation.

671
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,470
There are reporters present.

672
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,630
My apologies, everyone.

673
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,120
I'm afraid I'll have to close
the exhibition for now.

674
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,320
I believe

675
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,080
there has to be
some sort of misunderstanding.

676
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,600
But rest assured.

677
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,390
We will find out

678
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,360
what exactly happened

679
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,800
and give everyone a satisfactory answer.

680
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,710
So you asked Xue Ning
to pretend to be Ning Fei

681
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,280
to convince me
into organizing the exhibition

682
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,120
all because of Mr. Ning's artworks?

683
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,190
You hid the artworks so well.

684
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,630
If I hadn't done so,

685
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,710
how could I have made you reveal them?

686
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,560
Then you've really underestimated me.

687
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,280
These paintings

688
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,630
were put in my care
per Ning Fei's request.

689
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,000
If you want them,

690
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,520
you could have asked Xue Ning
to take them directly.

691
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,950
Why the need to create such a ruckus?

692
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,430
Don't you think

693
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,760
this is more dramatic?

694
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,190
I think you just want
to destroy Yunma for good.

695
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,120
Just so that Snow would have
a firm standing in China,

696
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,520
don't you think

697
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,630
your methods are a little too cruel?

698
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,520
(Xue Ning!)

699
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,910
(Let go! I'm going in!)

700
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,430
You liar! How could you do this to me?

701
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,910
Miss Lin, control yourself!

702
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,040
You shut up! Who said you could butt in?

703
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
An outsider shouldn't interfere

704
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,870
in relationship matters.

705
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,950
So you weren't Ning Fei this whole time.

706
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
You never recovered your memory,
did you?

707
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,080
Yes.

708
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,360
So you did this

709
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
all because of the paintings.

710
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,190
What about me then? What am I to you?

711
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,670
Am I just a pawn?

712
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,470
Yes.

713
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,040
That's right.

714
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,080
All of you want me

715
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,390
to go back to being Ning Fei, right?

716
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,280
Right now, I am Ning Fei.

717
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
I'm going to take back

718
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,600
everything that belonged to me.

719
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,910
You jerk!

720
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,000
Feifei!

721
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,630
Feifei.

722
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,150
You listen up! You're not Ning Fei!

723
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,520
You don't deserve to live with his name!

724
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,120
Calm down. There are reporters outside.

725
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,630
What transpired today
is only the beginning.

726
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,390
I won't allow you

727
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,390
to take Mr. Ning's paintings away.

728
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,950
That won't be up to you.

729
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,280
You have two days.

730
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,430
If you won't hand over the copyright,

731
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,320
we'll just have to meet in court.

732
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,870
You guys comfort her.

733
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,320
I'll take care of things outside.

734
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,560
Okay, they're gone.

735
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,600
They're gone.

736
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,950
How was it? Did I do a convincing job?

737
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,150
You were awesome.

738
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,600
You really let loose.

739
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,430
I couldn't react properly.

740
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,360
This is an actor's learned skill.

741
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,630
To really listen,
really see, and really feel.

742
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,390
It's all authentic.

743
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,910
So the first step is a success.

744
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,600
But there are many reporters present.

745
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,120
I worry that if things get out of hand,

746
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,040
it will negatively affect Yunma.

747
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,230
That's unavoidable.

748
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,320
If we didn't do this,

749
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,430
Xue Zi wouldn't truly trust Fei.

750
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,840
And Fei couldn't
have gotten close to the diary.

751
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,230
Don't worry.

752
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,430
As long as
we get our hands on the diary,

753
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,320
we'll be able
to prove Wei Qing's innocence.

754
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,230
Feifei, you really went
all out just now.

755
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,120
Fei's face got all red.

756
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,390
How else am I supposed to do it?

757
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,840
I'm a professional, you know.

758
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,840
To really listen, really see,
and really feel.

759
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,800
Otherwise,
Xue Zi wouldn't have believed it.

760
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,870
Who knew the diary Fei mentioned

761
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,000
contained so many

762
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,840
unfavorable details on Wei Qing?

763
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,190
No wonder Xue Zi is using it as her ace.

764
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,280
Right.

765
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,190
When Fei told me about it,

766
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,630
I was skeptical.

767
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,950
Thank goodness he came to us.

768
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,190
I need your help.

769
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,870
You want me to return
the copyright to you?

770
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,320
Yes.

771
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,710
This is so I can win Xue Zi's trust.

772
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,390
She now thinks of me as Xue Ning.

773
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,040
Plus, she's about to take action
against Wei Qing.

774
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,600
I have to stop her.

775
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,430
How can I help?

776
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,870
My father left behind a diary.

777
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,630
It was originally with me.

778
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,360
But Xue Zi took it.

779
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,430
She's planning

780
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,080
to use the diary against Wei Qing.

781
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,150
I need to get it back.

782
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,320
But will giving you back the copyright

783
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,800
make her trust you?

784
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,870
I also need you guys
to put on an act with me.

785
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
We need to make her believe

786
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,150
we've turned against each other.

787
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,280
That's the only way

788
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,600
for me to get the diary back.

789
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,560
I can help you.

790
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,560
But I think you should tell Feifei.

791
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,040
After all, you are closest to her.

792
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,710
She should know the truth.

793
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,950
Tell me what?

794
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,710
You brat.
If you hide anything from me again,

795
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,470
you'll be dead meat.

796
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,950
I have a plan.

797
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,280
We've done everything we could.

798
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,360
Now it's up to Fei.

799
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,560
Alright, you two should leave.

800
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,470
Or else, Wei Qing and Mingcheng
will get suspicious.

801
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,190
Are you really
not going to tell Wei Qing?

802
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,630
No.

803
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,280
They kept us in the dark last time.

804
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,360
This time, we'll let them

805
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,120
have a taste of their own medicine.

806
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,670
Why are those two still in there?

807
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,360
Feifei was dealt a really big blow.

808
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,320
It won't be easy to calm her down.

809
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,430
How is Feifei?

810
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,230
She fell asleep crying.

811
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,600
What about you guys? How did it go?

812
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,710
We've spoken to the press.

813
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:39,870
But we can't guarantee

814
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,630
there weren't any Xue Zi spies.

815
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,600
I'm afraid it will be on the headline

816
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,710
of all major press.

817
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,840
The Xue siblings are truly evil.

818
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,150
First, he pretended to be Ning Fei

819
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,910
and tricked Shishi
into returning the copyright.

820
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,910
Today, he set us up.

821
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,230
What's the matter?

822
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,390
You haven't said anything
since coming back.

823
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,520
I don't get why the diary

824
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,360
is with her.

825
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,600
My dad never mentioned it.

826
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,870
Could it be fake?

827
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,800
No way.

828
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,760
The fact that Xue Zi presented it
must mean it's real.

829
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,670
If it really contains

830
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,360
the things Xue Zi said,

831
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,120
then it's a ticking time bomb.

832
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,520
It could destroy Yunma.

833
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,870
I'd never have expected this.

834
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,870
That Xue Zi's trump card is Ning Fei.

835
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,630
So long as Ning Fei
is under her control,

836
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,390
and with the diary,

837
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,670
my guess is that it will be very hard

838
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,120
