20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,120
Well?

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,310
Should I exchange with her?

22
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,870
Since Xue Zi suggested
exchanging shares,

23
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,230
I guess she's offering me
an olive branch.

24
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,480
She wants to bind
Yunma and Snow together.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,270
Looks like she really does trust you.

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,000
Actually, I think Xue Zi

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,800
isn't as evil as we think.

28
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,680
At least, she treats me nicely.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't want to break her trust.

30
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,830
You always see the good in others.

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,440
Okay. I never wanted
to do anything to her anyway.

32
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,880
I only wanted to find out

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,550
who it was that sabotaged me.

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,830
If she's not involved in the incident,

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,390
I'm willing to work with Snow

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,960
with you acting as the bridge.

37
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,360
If that's the case,

38
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,830
let's put a stop
to the marriage proposal.

39
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,750
Enough fooling around.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,960
My mom's phone
is about to blow from the calls.

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Family relatives we know and don't know

42
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,550
are scrambling over one another

43
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,000
to deliver gifts to our house.

44
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,240
They're all asking when's the big day.

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,320
I'm about to lose it.

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,600
Even though I put on the act

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,080
to bait the one responsible
for what happened,

48
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,160
my inviting you to become
Yunma's shareholder

49
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,000
and wanting to marry you
are my sincere wishes.

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,080
As long as you agree,

51
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,470
we can have the wedding any time.

52
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,270
In your dreams. Who wants to marry you?

53
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,910
This is my second time proposing to you.

54
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,190
Tell me, Miss Zhou.

55
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,240
Do I mean anything to you at all?

56
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,320
No, you don't.

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,910
Okay.

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,550
Let me ask you then.

59
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,390
Yes?

60
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,720
What we just spoke about

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,270
could have been relayed over WeChat.

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,270
Why did you go to the trouble
to put on a disguise

63
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,600
to come and see me?

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,470
Tell me.

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
- Hello?
- The helmet is dirty.

66
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,630
Tell me.

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,550
I hope they didn't
make things hard for you.

68
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,080
They still want me to talk you out

69
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,390
of handing over

70
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,670
that big of a share to Miss Zhou.

71
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,160
I reckon, in their eyes,

72
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm the ruler of a dying empire

73
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,000
while Zhou Shi is the evil courtesan.

74
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,160
Are you really
not going to appease them?

75
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,160
There's no need.

76
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,360
They're people from my mother's time.

77
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,880
Usually, they just sit idly,

78
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,470
waiting for the bonus.

79
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,190
When you want them to do actual work,

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
none can step up to the plate.

81
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,160
Thankfully, there are still you
and Li Mingcheng.

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,000
I might as well take this opportunity

83
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,630
to overhaul the company.

84
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,910
Are you sure about that, Mr. Wei?

85
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,670
This is going to be a test.

86
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,440
Whoever fails can pack their bags.

87
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,790
Got it. I'll see to it.

88
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,000
(Snow Group)

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,640
Mr. Zhang, let me introduce her to you.

90
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,550
This is Zhou Shi.

91
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,790
She's Snow Group's newest shareholder.

92
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,270
She's also my trusted assistant.

93
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,390
She'll be taking part
in our future collaboration too.

94
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,200
Please look after her well.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,950
Hello, Mr. Zhang. I'm still learning.

96
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,390
Looking forward to your guidance.

97
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,880
You're too polite, Miss Zhou.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,670
Even if Ms. Xue hadn't introduced you,

99
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,830
I already knew who you were.

100
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,040
You're the talk of the town lately.

101
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,320
I mean, not only are you
a shareholder of Yunma,

102
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,200
you've also become one at Snow.

103
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,760
A capable youngster indeed.

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,550
I doubt you'll need our guidance.

105
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,760
I should be asking
for your assistance instead.

106
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,950
You flatter me, Mr. Zhang.

107
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,880
Have a seat.

108
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,830
Okay.

109
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,070
- Treat us.
- Treat us.

110
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,760
It's not a problem to treat you.

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,790
Speak up.

112
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,440
Hotpot? Barbecue? Crayfish?

113
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,230
How stingy are you?

114
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,600
You're a shareholder now.

115
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,320
Why are you still acting like a miser?

116
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,350
I don't care.

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,550
I'm putting my stamp
on your thigh, Ms. Zhou.

118
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,790
It's up to you
to make me a first-rate star.

119
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,160
Stop that.

120
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,200
Aren't you going to greet the ladies?

121
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,510
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

122
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,880
Hello, Miss Brainiac.

123
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,200
Hi, Feifei.

124
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,550
Hello.

125
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,880
Have you eaten, ladies?

126
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,880
What would you like? I'll buy it.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,040
We've already ordered.

128
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,760
It's fine.

129
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,200
Alright. You ladies go ahead then.

130
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,600
I won't intrude.

131
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,830
What's up with him?

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,790
I'm not sure.

133
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,040
He's been so obedient
since he came back from the party.

134
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,760
I asked him why, but he wouldn't say.

135
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,720
I think

136
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,550
maybe he's remembered something.

137
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,600
Really?

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,440
Although his demeanor changed
drastically when he lost his memory,

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,200
he is still Ning Fei in essence.

140
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,950
You need to pay more attention.

141
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,510
Give him more guidance.

142
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,830
Help to trigger his memory.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,640
Whether or not he regains his memory,

144
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,920
he is still Ning Fei.

145
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,600
Besides,

146
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,070
that's not what
we should worry about right now.

147
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,320
We should think about

148
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,720
how to help Ms. Zhou spend her money.

149
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,230
Considering our deep friendship,

150
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,390
buying me a house

151
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,760
shouldn't be a problem, right?

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,200
Don't be silly.

153
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,830
I'm just helping Wei Qing

154
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,270
to keep it temporarily.

155
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,880
Besides, I don't know the exact figure.

156
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,550
I can't simply spend.

157
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,270
I know it.

158
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,550
When I first heard of the news,

159
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,040
I did a search online.

160
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,000
Allow me to tell you

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,880
exactly how much Zhou Shi has

162
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,390
with the most direct way seen online.

163
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,480
What are you doing?

164
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,920
Let me explain.

165
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,320
Imagine one grain of rice
is 100,000 yuan.

166
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,920
- 100,000 yuan.
- So,

167
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,790
ten grains equal to one million yuan.

168
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,920
So how much money does Zhou Shi have?

169
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
It's all this.

170
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,950
So much?

171
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,230
Even if Zhou Shi wanted to buy you

172
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,550
a house worth 10 million,

173
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,720
it'd only be 100 grains of rice.

174
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,550
About this much.

175
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,640
It won't even make a dent in the pile.

176
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Oh, my goodness.

177
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,760
What is this?

178
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,390
What just flashed across my eyes?

179
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,790
I know. It's your extravagance.

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,720
No.

181
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,550
Zhou Shi.

182
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,000
The fact that Wei Qing
gave you the shares

183
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,510
means he's given you Yunma's future.

184
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,790
You two are now tied together by fate.

185
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,070
You need to have a proper think 

186
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,920
about the change in your identity.

187
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,320
Think about your future with him.

188
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:01,725
(Darling)

189
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,670
Hello, Darling.

190
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,720
Hi, Honey.

191
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,270
Having fun at Feifei's house?

192
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,390
Do you need me to pick you up?

193
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,670
Honey, I won't be going back tonight.

194
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,790
I'm sleeping over at Feifei's.

195
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,200
Is everything okay at home?

196
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,640
Everything's fine.

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,480
Just that I still want to drink

198
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,790
the soup from yesterday.

199
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,550
Okay.

200
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,670
Zhou Shi will be coming for dinner
tomorrow.

201
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,760
I'll make it for you.

202
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,270
This is the first time

203
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,230
you asked me to make soup for you.

204
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,550
What they said is true.

205
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,950
Food is the trade-off
for all matters on earth.

206
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,920
Darling, I have to go.

207
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,880
Someone is here.

208
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,830
I'll video call you tonight.

209
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,760
Love you.

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,280
Bye, Honey. Love you.

211
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Mr. An.

212
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,110
I'm here to discuss something with you.

213
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,200
Are you free now?

214
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,710
Yes. Please come in.

215
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,710
Mr. Wei, the shareholders want to call
an executive meeting.

216
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,000
Executive meeting?

217
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,875
(Yunma Group)

218
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,350
Why the sudden executive meeting?

219
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,230
See, there are some changes

220
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,880
with the shareholding ratio.

221
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,440
This is to notify you.

222
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,550
The chairman is in a bit of trouble.

223
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,150
He needs you to transfer your shares
back to him.

224
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
What happened to him?

225
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,640
Wei An's shareholding

226
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,000
already exceeds yours by two percent.

227
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,840
It means
he's Yunma's biggest shareholder.

228
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,470
Mr. Wei gave half of his shares
to Miss Zhou.

229
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,880
He's worried

230
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,590
that the mole within the company

231
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,350
would use the matter to deal him a blow.

232
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,670
So we hope

233
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,910
you'd temporarily
transfer your shares back to him.

234
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,670
Impossible.

235
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,910
I only gave him 15 percent
of the shares.

236
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,200
That's in the past.

237
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,110
Now, he's acquired

238
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,760
other shares from minority shareholders.

239
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,640
Plus, he received a big investment.

240
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,590
So in fact, he owns

241
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,400
about 28 percent of the shares now.

242
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,880
You can call Mr. Wei up to confirm it.

243
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,550
But I think he's in a meeting now.

244
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,230
I won't disturb him then.

245
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,350
You came to me personally.

246
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,400
I shouldn't be worried.

247
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,320
Alright.

248
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,670
You just have to sign here.

249
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,550
Okay.

250
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:43,675
(Party B: Li Mingcheng)

251
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,200
Okay.

252
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,470
A big investment?

253
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,000
From who?

254
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,910
I'm asking you a question.

255
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,910
With Yunma's current position,

256
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,470
many people
would be interested to invest.

257
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,280
It's just that someone happened
to come to me.

258
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,520
Mr. Wei.

259
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,200
We all tried to stop you

260
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,200
from transferring the shares
to Zhou Shi.

261
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,320
But you ignored
the board of directors' advice.

262
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,080
You went rogue.

263
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,550
Right, what we need is a decision-maker.

264
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,440
Not a Romeo.

265
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,590
You lost your judgment
because of a woman.

266
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,320
I suggest we have a vote.

267
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,960
We'll vote for a new chairman.

268
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,000
Alright.
Let's raise our hands to decide.

269
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,150
Those in favor of Wei An
to be the new chairman,

270
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,200
raise your hand.

271
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,110
So you're after my seat.

272
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,350
Wei An.

273
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,910
Do you dare sit in it

274
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,670
if I let you?

275
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,080
Mr. Wei.

276
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,670
Hope we'll work well together.

277
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
Wei Qing!

278
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,840
Mr. Wei.

279
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,030
You've lost the people's support.

280
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,710
Don't lose your composure too.

281
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,150
Okay.

282
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,910
- Mr. Chairman.
- Mr. Chairman.

283
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,300
(Li Mingcheng)

284
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,150
Hello, Mr. Wei.

285
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,000
I have no time to explain.

286
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,000
I need you

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,670
to transfer your three percent of shares
to me first.

288
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,550
I'll return them to you
once this is over.

289
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,550
My shares?

290
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,840
Haven't I already given them to you?

291
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,440
Mr. Wei, did something happen?

292
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,200
Is something wrong with the agreement?

293
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,320
It's nothing.

294
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,640
You rest well at home.

295
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,280
I'll call you if there's anything.

296
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,790
I didn't expect our plan

297
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,000
would go so well.

298
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,150
I had thought

299
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,280
Wei Qing would put up a fight.

300
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,230
But we took him down so easily.

301
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,960
It's a little stale.

302
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,080
It's too soon to think we've won.

303
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Once he calms down,

304
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,000
that's when he'll fight back.

305
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't forget. Zhou shi

306
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,760
has 25 percent of the shares.

307
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,400
She only has 15 percent now.

308
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,400
She's given 10 percent to Xue Zi.

309
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,910
Do you think she or my sister

310
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,590
would use it to help Wei Qing?

311
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,440
From my understanding of Zhou Shi,

312
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,960
she'll definitely do it.

313
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,400
From my understanding of my sister,

314
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,350
she'll never do it.

315
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,880
This battle is a sure win for us.

316
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,230
Come.

317
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,520
I know you feel bad
for betraying Wei Qing.

318
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,790
But you need to know.

319
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,470
If he knew you were involved

320
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,710
in Wei Heng's death,

321
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,960
then

322
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,840
you'd be the one

323
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,960
who is dead.

324
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,470
Here's to our partnership.

325
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,640
Mr. Wei.

326
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,670
To our partnership, Mr. Xue.

327
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,960
(Hello. The number you have dialed
is powered off.)

328
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,320
(Sorry.)

329
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,590
(The number you have dialed
is powered off.)

330
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,400
Is it still off?

331
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,470
It's all my fault.

332
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,670
I should've called

333
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,000
the chairman at the time to confirm.

334
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,080
At least,

335
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,590
I should have read the agreement.

336
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,150
I don't blame you, Mingcheng.

337
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,640
No one would have expected

338
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Wei An to betray Wei Qing.

339
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,840
How many shares does Wei An have now?

340
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,200
Together with the investment,

341
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,200
it's 28 percent, almost 29 percent.

342
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,790
That's 3 percent more than Wei Qing.

343
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,400
How many shares do you have?

344
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,710
15 percent.

345
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,080
If you give your 15 percent to Wei Qing,

346
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,640
he'll have 41 percent of the shares.

347
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,440
Wouldn't that be enough
to regain his chairman position?

348
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,400
You're right.
Why didn't I think of that?

349
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,080
So Wei Qing accidentally set up a Plan B

350
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,550
when he gave me the shares.

351
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,790
But if I could figure this out,

352
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,440
why didn't Wei Qing?

353
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,200
He even called Li Mingcheng.

354
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,640
Why didn't he call you?

355
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
That's right.

356
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,400
Why didn't he?

357
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,520
Don't look at me.

358
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,230
Nothing will happen to Wei Qing.

359
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,840
Wei Qing has a backup plan.

360
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,280
What I can't figure out

361
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,550
is how Wei An could betray Wei Qing.

362
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,470
He's supposed to be
Wei Qing's most trusted assistant.

363
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,080
The thing that could make Wei An
commit betrayal 

364
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,640
cannot be money.

365
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,080
Then what?

366
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,640
I noticed you've been asking me

367
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,440
why all day.

368
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,320
Your brain seems
to have shut down today.

369
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,230
I've been trying
to locate Wei Qing all day.

370
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,710
I haven't eaten anything.

371
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,910
I'm so hungry

372
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,280
that I can't think properly.

373
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Then let's eat first.

374
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,280
I already made the food.

375
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,960
It's not like
there's anything we can do now.

376
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,230
But I don't have the mood to eat now.

377
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,880
When an animal is injured,

378
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,280
it will look for an empty spot

379
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
to nurse its wounds.

380
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,520
The same goes for humans.

381
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,840
This is the self-protection mechanism

382
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,550
living creatures have had for centuries.

383
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,230
Wei Qing probably found a quiet spot

384
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,590
to gather his thoughts.

385
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,200
He'll be fine.

386
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,150
Come on, Shishi. Let's go eat.

387
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,590
(Hello. The number you've dialed
is powered off.)

388
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,960
Dig in.

389
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,550
It's delicious.

390
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,590
Eat more if it's good.

391
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,320
This is going to be my last work.

392
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,280
There won't be anymore.

393
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,280
Last work?

394
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,200
You won't cook anymore?

395
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,440
That's a pity.

396
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,910
At first, I started cooking
to nourish Li Mingcheng's health.

397
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,470
Now that he seems better,

398
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,830
it's safe for me to say

399
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,190
I passed the cooking test.

400
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,040
A lesson that I've conquered

401
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,470
no longer attracts me.

402
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,110
I've packed up all the cooking tools
and sold them.

403
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,520
The second-hand prices are bad.

404
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,040
You might as well give them to me.

405
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,110
Dropper, beaker,

406
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,190
evaporating dish, condenser.

407
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,230
Are you sure these are cooking utensils?

408
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,710
Not tools used to do experiments?

409
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,830
To me,

410
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,430
the temperature and amount

411
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,680
have to be precise.

412
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,560
All those tools were necessary.

413
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,040
Forget it.

414
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,350
No treasures to pick from you.

415
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,880
I have no use for these things.

416
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,110
Wei Qing replied.

417
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,350
Miss Brainiac, Mingcheng.

418
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,070
Thanks for the hospitality. I'm leaving.

419
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,560
Take care.

420
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,560
Be safe.

421
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,470
I will.

422
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,110
What's the matter?

423
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,640
You seem moody.

424
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,920
Lessons you have conquered

425
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,950
no longer attract your attention.

426
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,280
What about me then?

427
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,110
Am I one of your conquered lessons?

428
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,640
That's right.

429
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,590
But you're a lesson

430
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,880
worthy of my whole life to conquer.

431
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,590
So...

432
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,560
the cooking utensils are gone.

433
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,470
Will I still be able to drink your soup?

434
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,350
Thanks, Darling.

435
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,800
Mr. Wei.

436
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,893
(Business giant Wei Qing
falls for beauty)

437
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:23,680
(Some say that the former chairman,
Wei Qing)

438
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,880
(won over the beauty
but lost his empire.)

439
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,110
(What is your opinion?)

440
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,590
(This is his personal matter.)

441
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,040
(I have no comment.)

442
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,880
(Rumors say you'll be leading Yunma)

443
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,400
(in its partnership with Snow Group.)

444
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,470
(Is that true?)

445
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,400
(That's right. Coming up,)

446
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,040
(Yunma will be working closely)

447
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,350
(with Snow Group on some projects.)

448
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,160
(I believe,
with the two companies' strengths,)

449
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,280
(we will surely be able
to achieve new growth.)

450
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,230
You're here.

451
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,800
Why did you hit me so hard?

452
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,880
You're so barbaric.

453
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,160
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

454
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,400
Why are you holed up here alone?

455
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,680
Can't you be more mature

456
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,070
and stop making other people worry?

457
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,830
I'm sorry.

458
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,830
Baby, I was wrong.

459
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,950
Does saying that change anything?

460
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,110
I know you'll make the mistake again.

461
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,560
Are you all right?

462
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,280
I'm not.

463
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,350
What's wrong?

464
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,520
My chest hurts.

465
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,070
I...

466
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,430
I went to the office to find Wei An.

467
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,110
But he refused to see me.

468
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,680
What exactly happened?

469
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,350
Nothing much.

470
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,520
Just that I was too naive and stupid.

471
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,160
And so I got betrayed
by someone I trusted.

472
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:48,524
(Equity transfer agreement)

473
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,710
Sign the agreement.

474
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,310
I'll give you back the shares.

475
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,070
No.

476
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,640
I gave them to you, so they're yours.

477
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,830
Can you not be so stubborn?

478
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,470
Don't you want to take Yunma back?

479
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,800
Do you know why Wei An betrayed me?

480
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,230
No, I don't.

481
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,470
Neither do I.

482
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,950
But the reason for his betrayal

483
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,710
couldn't have been money.

484
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,070
You and Miss Brainiac
said the same thing.

485
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,560
Zhou Shi.

486
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,880
You're the only one

487
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,430
who can help me right now.

488
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,040
It's safer for you

489
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,920
to keep the shares than me.

490
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,430
No matter who it is
that's behind Wei An,

491
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,040
you're the person

492
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,950
they wish to win over.

493
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,280
And I believe,

494
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,110
the one behind Wei An

495
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,680
has to be either one

496
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,950
of the Xue siblings.

497
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,470
Or they could be working together.

498
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,110
If at this time,

499
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,830
you transfer the shares to me,

500
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,800
then they will know

501
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,070
that you're on my side.

502
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,310
They won't trust you again.

503
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,920
So, what you need to do now

504
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,190
is to stay put and wait
for that person to take the bait.

505
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,800
And then find out

506
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,920
exactly what his chip is.

507
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,920
Understand?

508
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,110
Then what about you?

509
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,040
Don't worry.

510
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,590
I'm still a main shareholder of Yunma.

511
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,190
They won't be able
to do anything to me just yet.

512
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Right now,

513
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,400
I'm unable to make a play.

514
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,350
But the day I make the move,

515
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,280
that's when the real game begins.

516
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,710
Before that,

517
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,950
I'll just take the time
to rest and take a break.

518
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,520
Understood.

519
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,830
I'll be more attentive.

520
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,430

521
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,710
somewhat familiar?

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,350
That won't do.

670
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,800
Is there a way to protect the knee?

671
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,920
Director, I have an idea.

672
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,190
What is it?

673
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,110
Are you sure this will work?

674
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,230
Yes, it will.
We'll put a few extra ones on top.

675
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,350
You have more, right?

676
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,560
None of your business.

677
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,760
Be quick with it.

678
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,950
Does it hurt?

679
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,190
You and your silly ideas.

680
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,520
There.

681
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,950
It's done. Come.

682
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,710
Cut!

683
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,680
Okay, that's good.

684
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,760
Good job, Feifei.

685
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,160
Get ready for the next shot.

686
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,310
Thank you, Director.

749
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,070
Ms. Zhou.

750
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,640
Guess who's here?

751
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,520
Who?

752

Yunma's chairman.

753
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,190
Wei Qing is here?

754
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,000
It's not Wei Qing, but Wei An.

755
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,800
Why is he here?

756
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,470
Mr. Xue invited him for a meeting.

757
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,310
Mr. Xue isn't here yet,

758
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,190
so I put him in the meeting room.

759
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,000
Alright. You may go.

760
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,590
Miss Zhou.

761
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,110
Is Mr. Wei doing all right these days?

762
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,310
Very well.

763
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,110
Thanks for your concern.

764
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,920
Are you sleeping well yourself, Mr. An?

765
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,680
Can you even fall asleep?

766
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,190
I'm sleeping very well.

767
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,560
Thanks for asking.

768
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,190
I've been waiting to find out.

769
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,800
Why did you betray Wei Qing?

770
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,150
He trusted you so much.

771
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,670
I'm only doing what's best
for Yunma's future.

772
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,760
Nowadays, it's hard
for a monopoly to survive.

773
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,230
Yunma needs allies.

774
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,360
If Xue Le

775
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,150
becomes the successor of Snow Group,

776
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,800
then our future partnership

777
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,320
will surely bring about profit.

778
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,040
Moreover, that's what you planned too.

779
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,630
Otherwise, you wouldn't have given

780
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,800
your shares to Xue Zi.

781
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,470
It's just that we're on different teams.

782
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,560
Do you really think that Xue Le alone

783
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,360
is enough to take down Xue Zi?

784
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,320
Xue Le alone definitely isn't enough.

785
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
But with Yunma, it will be enough.

786
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,600
I won't let you get your way.

787
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,800
I am a shareholder
at both Yunma and Snow.

788
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,430
I have a say in all decision-making.

789
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,560
I will stop you.

790
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,560
I trust in your ability.

791
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,000
But today,

792
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,760
I'm here to discuss a partnership.

793
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,230
Will you hear me out?

794
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,600
Go ahead.

795
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,600
In the following months,

796
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,080
Yunma and Shangjue
will be sharing resources.

797
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,230
Both companies will share the copyright

798
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,080
for all artists and designers
under the brand

799
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
to co-develop new products.

800
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,800
But Shangjue is a new company.

801
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,520
Their artists are all newbies.

802
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,840
Their commercial value is limited.

803
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,080
Meanwhile, the artists under Yunma
are all established.

804
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,760
If you share resources with Shangjue,

805
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,040
Shangjue will be getting
a whole lot more from it.

806
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,150
But for Yunma,

807
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,870
you'll just be presenting them
with a golden robe.

808
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,120
Are you doing charity work here, Mr. An?

809
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,230
I understand your concern.

810
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,710
But we should cast our sight further.

811
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,950
Shangjue is a subsidiary of Snow Group.

812
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,760
Our ultimate partner is Snow.

813
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,840
I can speak on behalf of Snow.

814
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,360
I reject the proposal.

815
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,190
I don't think you have the right
to represent Snow.

816
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,870
I didn't ask you to greet Mr. Wei.

817
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,390
You may go.

818
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,230
Your behavior just now

819
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,600
has seriously damaged
the interest of Shangjue.

820
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,390
As per company rules,

821
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,000
I will submit a request
to the headquarters to terminate you.

822
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,870
Whether or not it's approved

823
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,430
will be up to my sister.

824
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,560
But starting tomorrow,

825
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,280
you don't have
to come to Shangjue anymore.

826
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,840
Mr. Xue.

827
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,870
Did you really think

828
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,190
you could best Wei Qing like this?

829
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,670
Doing business isn't some child's play.

830
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,600
It's not only about winning.

831
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,390
I'm just

832
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,910
maximizing the company's profit.

833
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,910
You still have a lot to learn.

834
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,630
Since Wei Qing
