16
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,999
Ning Fei's sister brought him back

17
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,999
and he didn't resist.

18
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,200
It seems like
there's a reason behind this.

19
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,560
They left in such a hurry

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,999
and he had no chance to say a word.

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Xue Zi was always there for Ning Fei

22
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:11,399
when he was a kid

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,719
and left on his own devices.

24
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,560
Although she was later
adopted by the Snow family,

25
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,279
she wouldn't give up looking for him.

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,400
Apparently, she meant
way more to Ning Fei

27
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:19,919
than I could have ever imagined.

28
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,919
Although they are not related by blood,

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,600
Xue Zi is the closest
family member he has.

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,680
The security she gives him

31
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,120
is something he can never get from us.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,400
What's more,

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,999
Xue Zi is now on an equal footing

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,880
with Wei Qing in the Snow family.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,040
They have always been sworn enemies,

36
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,040
so naturally,
they won't be too friendly to us.

37
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,719
And you.

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,919
How could you just let her
take your boyfriend away?

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,880
What else could I have done?

40
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:43,839
Should I have thrown myself

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,160
in front of the car
and let the car trample over me?

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,719
That brat left very decisively.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,199
I won't be waiting for him anymore.

44
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,160
Some of us can barely stand by her word.

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
Don't worry.

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,839
I'll be abroad as well,

47
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,040
so I'll keep an eye on Fei.

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,439
Are you going to continue living abroad?

49
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,359
Fine.

50
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,079
I guess, sooner or later,

51
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,800
they might need to move
the headquarters of Yunma there.

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,279
I wonder how many families

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,559
you are going to separate then.

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,359
What a great sin.

55
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:15,680
That's enough.

56
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,479
My head hurts.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,439
You know I hate making decisions.

58
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,960
This looks like a nice studio.

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,639
It's a shame
that you're living on your own.

60
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,199
Should I move in with you?

61
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,960
Forget it.

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
You're married.

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,639
Don't you like sleeping
on the double bed back at your place?

64
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:34,800
Sometimes, we all need

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,079
some space and time alone.

66
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,960
Just tell me the answer

67
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,999
if you call yourselves my good friends.

68
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,040
No.

69
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,880
But we have another option.

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,120
What do you think?

71
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,639
It's not bad, right?

72
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,199
Didn't Ning Fei already rent this place?

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,079
How can I live here?

74
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,320
Don't you get it?

75
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,919
After Ning Fei left,

76
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,279
not only did Feifei not terminate
the tenancy agreement,

77
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,280
but she also rented the entire building.

78
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,599
Isn't this

79
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
a painting by Zakurokun?

80
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,720
How did you...

81
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,199
Don't you think Ning Fei

82
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,759
looks like the character in the drawing?

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,919
The rabbit is crying.

84
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,199
It's not cute at all.

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,159
A cunning rabbit has three nests.

86
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,960
It lost its nest

87
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,680
so it's crying.

88
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,720
Feifei.

89
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,879
You can cry all you want.
I won't laugh at you.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,960
I'm not sad.

91
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,199
I'm upset.

00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,200
Miss Wu, I'm sorry.

168
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,200
Something has happened
and I can't join you anymore.

169
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,959
I'm really sorry.

170
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,519
Zhou Shi.

171
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,279
- Hi.
- Hello.

172
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,359
Have a seat.

173
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,719
Sorry. Things have gotten pretty busy
since I came back.

174
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,640
I had a meeting just now
and it ended later than expected.

175
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,719
It's fine.

176
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,000
I should be sorry for the delay.

177
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,640
It took me quite some time
to get back to you.

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,640
I'm really sorry about that.

179
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:23,519
You don't have to be sorry.

180
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,159
We should be the ones apologizing.

181
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,599
I'm really sorry

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that I'm going to let you down.

183
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,200
Let me down?

184
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,479
The Department of Labor received
an anonymous complaint from a student,

185
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,479
alleging that you obtained
your internship opportunity

186
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,719
through an illegitimate channel.

187
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,919
A complaint?

188
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,159
Against me?

189
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,279
(We're trying our best
to prove to the said department)

190
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,959
(that you got picked by Master)

191
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,440
(because of your talent in drawing.)

192
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,479
(However, we probably
weren't convincing enough)

193
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,760
(and we failed to turn things around.)

194
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,399
(We're really sorry)

195
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,279
(they had to take this opportunity
away from you.)

196
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,159
Zhang Shuai,

197
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,959
how are you doing abroad?

198
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:07,159
What? Did you hear what happened too?

199
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:09,880
Yes.

200
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,080
Anyway, I lost my internship.

201
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,200
It doesn't matter.

202
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,640
I never planned to go back anyway,

203
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,279
so there's nothing for me
to feel sad about.

204
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,640
What are you saying?

205
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,599
There is obviously a big issue.

206
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,880
Really? Have I offended someone so badly

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,880
that they wanted
to ruin all the chances I had overseas?

208
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,240
How are things going there?

209
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,159
The studio

210
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,440
has withdrawn the letter of offer.

211
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,560
Although a complaint was lodged,

212
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,560
only a handful of people at school
heard of this.

213
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,279
This shouldn't affect

214
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,719
Miss Zhou's reputation.

215
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,279
However...

216
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,599
What are you trying to say?

217
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,640
What if this is a very rare opportunity?

218
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
She will come by a lot of opportunities
as long as I'm around.

219
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,640
Good morning. It seems like
you didn't sleep well yesterday.

220
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,039
How could you tell?

221
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,839
You always follow your biological clock

222
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:24,800
to a tee.

223
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,719
You always wake up at the same time,
plus or minus five minutes.

224
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,680
Today, you're half an hour late.

225
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,959
Did you get triggered
by what I said yesterday?

226
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,519
Do you want to try out
the new topic too?

227
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,200
Am I nothing

228
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,800
but an experimental subject for you?

229
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,760
Of course, not. You're also someone

230
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,120
I can observe, communicate
and have fun with.

231
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,839
However, you do quite a good job

232
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,680
as a cohabitant.

233
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,880
What you mentioned yesterday,

234
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,479
about fulfilling the duties of a wife,

235
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,440
was just you trying
to manipulate my mood

236
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,640
so that it would
make your experiment easier?

237
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,800
No. I genuinely meant it yesterday.

238
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,760
I've written an email
regarding the execution

239
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,000
and the operation in detail

240
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,399
and sent it to you.

241
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,560
Let me know if you've received it.

242
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,919
Done?

243
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,640
It gives quite a thorough guide

244
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,200
regarding the operation.

245
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,599
The execution guide
has also steered clear

246
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,599
of the most fertile period.

247
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:26,200
The step-by-step diagram

248
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,120
is slightly too graphic.

249
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,240
Where did you learn this from?

250
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,880
I saw this in my parents' drawer
when I was a kid.

251
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,279
The cover of the CD read,
"The Animal World".

252
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,320
That's enough.

253
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,359
Don't say anymore.

254
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,279
I got it.

255
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,719
We've had enough knowledge of this.

256
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,839
However,
if we are to execute it physically,

257
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,919
we are still missing some crucial steps.

258
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,560
That's all. Now...

259
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,959
We'll leave the rest to you.

260
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,159
You're one year late.

261
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,479
Li Mingcheng,

262
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,680
you did a good job curbing your desire.

263
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:09,959
Compared to the chairman who's having
a long-distance relationship,

264
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,240
this is nothing.

265
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,599
Although your love story has dragged on
for one whole season,

266
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,560
we can't find
better role models than you.

267
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,440
We have no choice but to learn
from the elementary students.

268
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,719
Who did you call an elementary student?

269
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,959
Zhou Shi,
didn't you hear what she said about you?

270
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,680
Don't you want to win?

271
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,959
Win what?

272
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,959
Is this a competition?

273
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:56,000
(Perhaps, I was wrong.)

274
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,359
Are you having a leg cramp?

275
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,760
Excuse me.

276
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:06,839
Zhang Shuai.

277
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,359
Zhou Shi.

278
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,399
I found out the truth.

279
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,440
It seems like this is the game point.

280
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:22,039
Sure. Let's have a showdown.

281
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,399
Thanks for letting me win.

282
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:43,560
Take all you want.

283
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,200
I didn't know you could do this.

284
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,359
Why not?

285
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,120
As long as you're rich enough.

286
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,159
By the way,

287
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,560
where is Zhou Shi?

288
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,880
Zhou Shi.

289
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,599
Zhou Shi.

290
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,680
We won.

291
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,279
Zhou Shi.

292
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,440
What happened?

293
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,159
Is your mood always this bad
during your menses?

294
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,599
You weren't like this before.

295
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,560
I...

296
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,800
Don't you think...?

297
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,680
Yes.

298
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,120
There's something wrong
between these two.

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,399
Forget it. I won't say much
since they're here.

300
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,159
We have to bring them to the next stop.

301
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,159
Let's go.

302
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,510
(Appreciation Gift. Let's talk.)

303
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,000
A top student, indeed.

304
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,760
Are we going anywhere else

305
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,440
tonight?

306
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,880
I...

307
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,800
I heard it would snow tonight.

308
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,399
Let's go take a walk

309
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,000
so that you can clear your head.

310
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,640
Sure.

311
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,560
I happen to have somewhere
I want to go too.

312
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,080
Let's go.

313
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,960
Do you still remember this place?

314
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,279
Of course.

315
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,800
I first met you on this bridge.

316
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,399
Fate has certainly brought us
to this bridge.

317
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,759
If I hadn't happened
to pass by this place,

318
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,200
nothing more would have happened. Right?

319
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,840
I don't think so.

320
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,399
Sometimes, I think

321
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,279
if everything is to happen
all over again,

322
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,119
I still won't let you go.

323
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,279
Is it because of the illness?

324
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,879
No.

325
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,119
It's because

326
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:06,039
you're my type.

327
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,639
I would have fallen for you
at first sight

328
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,440
even if you only showed your face.

329
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,519
All you have to do is show up

330
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,119
and leave the rest to me.

331
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,680
You don't have to do anything.

332
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,239
You just need to trust me.

333
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,800
Trust you?

334
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,519
About what?

335
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,279
Believe me that everything I do

336
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:37,039
is for your sake.

337
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,440
Have you ever lied to me?

338
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,119
Have you told me any white lies before?

339
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,440
What do you mean?

340
00:18:58,399 --> 00:18:59,919
I only have one question.

341
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,159
Were you behind

342
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,039
the complaint lodged against me?

343
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,720
Do you have to do this?

344
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,840
Answer me.

345
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,440
What do you need the answer for?

346
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,759
What will you do

347
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:37,999
if the answer is yes?

348
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm the one asking the question.

349
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:41,720
Why did you approach

350
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,080
Jason Wu's secretary in private?

351
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,999
(Why did she leave the company)

352
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,159
(and join yours
right after she settled my case?)

353
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,999
(Even the student who lodged
a complaint against me)

354
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:51,119
(received an overseas offer from Yunma.)

355
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,200
It seems like

356
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,360
I'm the only unemployed person here.

357
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,879
Zhou Shi.

358
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:57,919
- It's fine.
- I...

359
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,279
I can speak on your behalf.

360
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,919
You can't stand going through
a long-distance relationship,

361
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:04,119
so you made a decision in my place.

362
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:05,519
You pushed me to the corner.

363
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,159
This was the arrangement you mentioned.

364
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,680
Some paths
are just not the right ones for you.

365
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,680
It's up to me to decide
if the path is the right one.

366
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,759
Who gave you the right
to decide my future for me?

367
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:16,519
Don't you have a place for me

368
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,200
in your future?

369
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,680
I was just doing all I could

370
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,279
to keep my relationship going.

371
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,440
Your relationship?

372
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,879
You're just being selfish.

373
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,960
All in all, you don't trust me.

374
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,919
What makes you think

375
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,279
that I'll leave you for my career?

376
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,480
You left me a year ago.

377
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,960
I was too naive back then

378
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,519

I heard you can tell all lies

411
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,999
when it snows.

412
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,440
Do you believe it?

413
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,239
What if it's a confession of love,

414
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,159
but not a lie?

415
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,800
I thought I should try it
on a full moon night.

416
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,800
Little did I know
I picked the wrong date.

417
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Wait.

418
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,279
So why did you come home
to view the moon?

419
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:24,759
If I am to tell you
the moon is really beautiful,

420
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,960
how will you feel?

421
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:32,639
See. You are not feeling anything.

422
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,879
The confession of an art student
never makes sense.

423
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,320
Or does it come with a prerequisite?

424
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,080
Anyway, we won't see the moon tonight.

425
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,080
Why not?

426
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:53,960
Look at this big and round moon.

427
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:54,960
It's so bright.

428
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,360
You can clearly see

429
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,879
the impact craters
and the lunar crater rays.

430
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,159
It seems like

431
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,840
the moon is just another planet.

432
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,159
Just like astrology predictions.

433
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,680
They obviously have nothing to do
with the humans,

434
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,035
yet there are people who entrust

435
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,480
the future of their relationship
to the stars.

436
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,039
Astronomy

437
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:16,800
is just another name
for the theory of love.

438
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,519
A Short History
of Nearly Everything says,

439
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,480
"If we were randomly inserted
into the cosmos,

440
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:30,239
the chance
that we would find ourselves on

441
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,279
or near a planet

442
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,399
would be less than one in a billion."

443
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,440
This world is precious.

444
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,360
Humans are all born by chance.

445
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,200
The chances of two humans
running into each other in this universe

446
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,999
are extremely low.

447
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,360
However,

448
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,080
I'm now holding your hand.

449
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,999
Don't you consider this a miracle?

450
00:24:58,919 --> 00:24:59,960
Therefore,

451
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,999
whether is this a relationship or not,

452
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,919
whether is there a confession or not,

453
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,999
for me, I'm already feeling
very contended.

454
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,239
Li Mingcheng.

455
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:12,680
Do you know how many types
of the stellar spectra

456
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,279
are there
in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram?

457
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:15,639
Seven.

458
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,759
O, B, A, F, G, K, M.

459
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,200
Do you also know

460
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,600
that in order to
memorize this effectively,

461
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,840
people have come up
with a simple formula?

462
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,480
Of course. I'll send it to you now.

463
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,600
No.

464
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,680
I want to hear you say it.

465
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:38,639
Sure.

466
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,519
In fact,
there's another version of this too.

467
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,039
I want to hear you say that too.

468
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,279
(Assuming)

469
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,879
(running into each other
in this universe is a miracle,)

470
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:06,360
(then, are farewells)

471
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,360
(Oh, Be A Fine Girl (Guy), Kiss Me)
(the norm?)

472
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,759
(I just didn't expect)

473
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,279
(this farewell would last for so long.)

474
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,090
(One Month Later)

475
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:32,080
Fei.

476
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,639
Zhou Shi.

477
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,759
A bodyguard assigned by the Snow family?

478
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,919
Your sister has gone to this extent
to keep you under her watch?

479
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,159
It's not my sister.

480
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,159
It's someone else.

481
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:46,039
However,

482
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,119
my sister is no better.

483
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,519
Yes.

484
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,480
For the past month,

485
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,519
I had been trying to get ahold of you
through Miss Xue,

486
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,960
but to no avail.

487
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,159
She will come to you,

488
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,239
but not now.

489
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,840
The Snow family is fighting like cats
and dogs among themselves.

490
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,239
You're an important resource for her.

491
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,800
She won't expose your identity
so easily.

492
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:07,440
An important resource?

493
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,480
Me?

494
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,200
Sorry, Zhou Shi.

495
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
I might have dragged you
into a huge mess.

496
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,440
Because of my painting...

497
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,960
You mean

498
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,999
the complete ownership
of Xunran Painting.

499
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,950
(Certificate of Distribution)

500
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,759
What is this?

501
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,320
If you like my paintings,

502
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,600
I'll give them all to you.

503
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,800
To me,

504
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,119
the paintings

505
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,680
shouldn't be displayed
in the exhibition hall

506
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,999
or a wealthy man's chamber.

507
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,519
They should be hung at the home
of someone who truly appreciates them.

508
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,639
I don't regret
gifting these paintings to you.

509
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,159
But...

510
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,759
But they are too expensive.

511
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,720
Even if you did that willingly,

512
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,560
your sister won't be happy
if she finds out,

513
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,960
right?

514
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,720
Now, I know

515
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,720
why Miss Xue

516
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,360
sent you here.

517
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,279
Don't worry. This is not a big issue.

518
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:04,800
I'll speak to the lawyer tomorrow
and get all the legal procedures done.

519
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,480
The ownership of all paintings
will be transferred back to you.

520
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,720
I've always wanted to return them
to their true owner.

521
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:13,759
Now, I feel really relieved.

522
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,759
But...

523
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,560
Stop pulling a long face.

524
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,919
The sooner you get it done,
the sooner you get to go home.

525
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:22,119
Feifei is waiting for you to go back
and provide her with an explanation.

526
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:25,879
Thanks, Zhou Shi.

527
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,639
That's so nice.

528
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,600
You get to go home.

529
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:31,999
What happened

530
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,399
between you and my senior?

531
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,480
Since the moment I came here,

532
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,639
he has not sent me a text.

533
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:44,999
Stupid arrogant man.

534
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:46,759
Saying sorry costs nothing.

535
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,039
Either you never apologize,
or you'll always be the one apologizing.

536
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,600
I'm not going to give in.

537
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,399
You said sorry in the previous season

538
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,999
and you even got very used to saying it.

539
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,320
As you said, it was the previous season.

540
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,039
Tell you what.

541
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,080
I always give in to her

542
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:07,840
and now she's spoiled.
That's why she left as she pleased.

543
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,960
She didn't even allow me
a chance to explain.

544
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,759
Is she really expecting me
to go after her

545
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,279
and apologize to her? Dream on.

546
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,519
Didn't you go after her

547
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,399
eventually?

548
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,239
Mr. Wei.

549
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,919
Mr. Wei, you...

550
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,480
Don't talk to me.

551
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,119
Help me find it.

552
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,320
The search dragged on until midnight

553
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:36,919
and we still couldn't find the ring.

554
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,919
Who told you
that I was looking for the ring?

555
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,159
Mr. Wei.

556
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,879
You can always buy a new ring
if you lose one,

557
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:44,440
but there are things

558
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,960
you can never replace.

559
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,360
I know what to do

560
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,999
but I have to hold my ground.

561
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,759
I won't act rashly.

562
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,320
Mr. Wei, I've booked you
a flight ticket.

563
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,560
And for your accommodation...

564
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,399
Well...

565
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,840
Considering the local time,

566
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:09,600
she is probably dreaming.

567
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,639
I agree.

568
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,320
Well...

569
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:14,560
I need to use the restroom.

570
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,560
I'll leave you be now.

571
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,159
Zhou Shi, it's late now.

572
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,720
Let me send you back to school.

573
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,039
But I don't think

574
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,320
I know the way to your school.

575
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,119
I forgot how bad I am with directions.

576
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,680
Now, you know.

577
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,159
Let me send you back.

578
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,879
This place isn't too safe.

579
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,720
You're a girl and you're on your own.

580
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,200
That's what you think.

581
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,680
Do I look like someone

582
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,440
who needs to be protected?

583
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,440
Well, you have to bring this with you.

584
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,600
Unplug this.

585
00:30:58,879 --> 00:30:59,840
It will sound the alarm

586
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,999
if anything happens,

587
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,200
and it'll send me

588
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,399
your live location right away and...

589
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,239
Stop.

590
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:07,519
Fei. You're worrying too much.

591
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,960
Wei Qing is not around.

592
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,039
Of course, I have to take care of you
on his behalf.

593
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:13,440
Perhaps,

594
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,200
he has already forgotten about me.

595
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
That's impossible.

596
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,480
Zhou Shi.

597
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,639
Wei Qing is too shy to speak his mind.

598
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,840
Don't mind what he said to you.

599
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,119
Right there.

600
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,759
Hurry up. It's just there.

601
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:26,720
Hurry up.

602
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,039
They run so fast.

603
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,840
Don't just sit there. Go now.

604
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:30,960
Hurry up.

605
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:32,119
Quick.

606
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,990
(The power is running out.)

607
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,239
(Eastern Time.)

608
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,440
(A Chinese student in the office
was attacked on her way back)

609
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,720
(to the apartment near the campus.)

610
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,080
(She fell into a severe coma)

611
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,039
(and is currently en route
to the nearby hospital to be saved.)

612
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,159
Pick up.

613
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,279
Pick up your phone, please.

614
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,840
- I...
- What's the matter?

615
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,919
I have classes to attend later.
Just cut to the chase.

616
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,279
What's wrong?

617
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,919
Can I only call you
when something happens?

618
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,759
Do you feel better if something happens?

619
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,080
I'm hanging up
if you have nothing to say.

620
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,600
Wait.

621
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,399
What's wrong with you, Zhou Shi?

622
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,879
It was just a trivial issue.

623
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,480
How long are you going
to hold the grudge for?

624
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,759
Is this how you're going to talk to me

625
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:38,960
over the phone in the future?

626
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:40,759
It won't happen again.

627
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,119
What do you mean?

628
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,720
Don't you get it yet?

629
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,519
I'm breaking up with you.

630
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,639
From now on,

631
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,680
don't call me again.
