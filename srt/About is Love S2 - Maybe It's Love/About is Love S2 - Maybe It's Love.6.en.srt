(Unknown number)

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,590
It's the last day of
the photography exhibition.

18
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,910
Your exhibition closing ceremony
has nothing to do with me.

19
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,470
Are you insane?

20
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,910
What did you say? My exhibition?

21
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,550
Please wait a minute.

22
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,470
Alright.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
Since I'm rather free today,

24
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,750
I'll drop by.

25
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:47,850
(Tianyuan Restaurant & Bar)

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,750
Am I being bluffed?

27
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,030
I'm sorry that I'm late.

28
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,600
Miss Lin.

29
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,630
You're here.

30
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,240
Order whatever you like.

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,470
It's my treat.

32
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,960
I'll order as I wish then.

33
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,440
Excuse me.

34
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,390
(Oh dear.)

35
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,160
(These dishes cost
at least a few thousand yuan.)

36
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,960
(Gosh, I didn't bring enough cash.)

37
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,440
Thank you for treating me to this meal.

38
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,670
If I were to come here alone,

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,190
I wouldn't dare to order this much.

40
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,830
As long as you're happy.

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,030
There won't be such a chance.

42
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,800
Do you have any dietary restrictions?

43
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,670
No.

44
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,830
Put it here.

45
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,160
Thank you.

46
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,960
It tastes quite sweet.

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,160
Although we'd normally
have dessert after the meal,

48
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,520
I really recommend this.

49
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,270
It's really good.

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,110
What's the ingredient?

51
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,160
I've never eaten

52
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,240
this kind of ice cream before.

53
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,670
It's just truffle

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
and white caviar.

55
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Have some more if you really like it.

56
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,960
Since it's just a taste test.

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,110
Taste test?

58
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,720
The chef is my friend.

59
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,000
He personally asked me
to taste-test the dishes.

60
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,790
Do you really think
that I bring you here

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,270
to spend all your money?

62
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,640
Miss Lin, honestly...

63
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,040
Alright, enough.

64
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,600
Excuse me.

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,830
Please bring me another serving of
caviar ice cream, thank you.

66
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,440
You wore this outfit
yesterday too, right?

67
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,480
What's wrong?

68
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,720
Nothing. I just think

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,640
that you look quite good in it.

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,640
Since when did you
pay attention to what I wear?

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,230
It doesn't seem like your interest.

72
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,200
Well, once in a while,

73
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm curious about how they package it
before putting it on the shelves.

74
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,000
Although

75
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,200
I prefer the factory mode.

76
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
Hold on.

77
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
What are you doing?

78
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,000
Nothing, well.

79
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,510
Are you staying at home today?

80
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,830
I have a new research project.

81
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,920
Is that so?

82
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,510
What is your research subject?

83
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,200
I'll get going then, Darling.

84
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,320
My research subject is you.

85
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,350
It looks exactly like a Fancam.

86
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,600
(Rachel)

87
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,640
Should I uncover your identity,

88
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,160
Little Fan?

89
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,550
Hello, I would like to ask

90
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,830
about the artist's schedule.

91
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,270
He's having his holidays abroad?

92
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,390
I shall meet him after he returns then.

93
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,230
He's living in seclusion
for a year for his new project?

94
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,950
I look forward to his new project.

95
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,480
He has signed a contract

96
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,880
and it's an exclusive authorization?

97
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,950
It's okay, thanks for the information.

98
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,270
It doesn't work out?

99
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,600
Yes. If it's not a close friend,

100
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,920
we usually need to
approach them six months prior

101
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,950
for brand collaborations.

102
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,040
All artists have their schedules

103
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,070
and project plans.

104
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,040
They wouldn't simply
allow someone to disrupt their plans.

105
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,320
By the way,

106
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,920
what about Mr. Wu?

107
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,350
I got his contact number.

108
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,200
But it turned out to be
a wrong number when I called.

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,320
Don't be discouraged, Ms. Zhou.

110
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:58,358
Although Jason Wu is
famous for being uncooperative,

111
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,830
I heard that he's sentimental.

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,920
If we can find someone

113
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,350
-he knows personally...
-Such as?

114
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Yunma's Wei Qing...

115
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,270
Alright, that's enough.

116
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,760
Why did you talk about him again?

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,390
Can't we not talk about him?

118
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,320
Why should we avoid him?

119
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,160
Why are you here, Mr. Xue?

120
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,230
Have a seat.

121
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Bring him a glass of water.

122
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,230
The chairperson sent
you over for assistance.

123
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,670
Of course I must pay you a visit.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,390
You're not working for
my sister anymore.

125
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,760
Are you used to it now?

126
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,160
It's still the same.

127
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,670
There's nothing to get used to.

128
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,550
Besides, as an employee,

129
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,480
we need guidance from our higher-ups.

130
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,830
Am I right, Pei?

131
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,270
Yes, this is your tea, Mr. Xue.

132
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,200
Guidance sounds exaggerated.

133
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,640
But I heard you mentioned Wei Qing.

134
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,880
What's the matter?

135
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,640
Do you bear grudges against him?

136
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,670
How is that possible?

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,320
It's just that he's too well-known

138
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,040
and I don't wish
to get involved with him.

139
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,760
You shouldn't worry about that.

140
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,790
If you can get involved with him,

141
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,760
you'll be doing me a great favour.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
If you become his weakness,

143
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,950
I think my sister would be more than happy.

144
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,720
But the point is,

145
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,760
are you willing to do so?

146
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,200
Alright. Resume your work.

147
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,760
Good day, Mr. Li.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,760
Good morning.

149
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,230
Rachel.

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,910
Inform Investment Department 1
for a meeting.

151
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,280
Also, print me

152
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,790
this month's project evaluation report.

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,640
Noted.

154
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,030
Mr. Li.

155
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,230
Well.

156
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,400
It's about my tie, isn't it?

157
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,960
My wife reminded me this morning.

158
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,320
I forgot about it again.

159
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,520
Your wife is really attentive.

160
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,790
By the way, I've joined
the company for a while,

161
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,640
but I've never met your wife.

162
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,200
She doesn't like to socialize.

163
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,550
Besides,

164
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,280
she seems to
be uninterested in my social circle.

165
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,400
I don't think so.

166
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,840
What if she would like to know us too?

167
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,880
By the way, Mr. Li.

168
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,550
This Sunday is your wedding anniversary.

169
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,670
The company would like
to prepare a gift for your wife.

170
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,280
Do you have any suggestions?

171
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,030
Or can you pass me her contact number?

172
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,030
Mr. Li.

173
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,670
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,110
Actually, I have no idea

175
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,670
that as my wife,

176
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,550
what gift would she like either.

177
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,320
Darling, what's your plan
for next Sunday?

178
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,590
Next Sunday? What's the matter?

179
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,840
Nothing much.

180
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,320
I just want to ask
if you're free on that day.

181
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,840
Are you going to bring me

182
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,110
to some fun places again?

183
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,550
Sure.

184
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,440
What else could it be?

185
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,440
Well, there's still one week

186
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,110
till next Sunday.

187
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,200
That's enough.

188
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,030
Good.

189
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,230
She's still the Bi Qiujing I know indeed.

190
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,790
That's weird.

191
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,710
Didn't I accept his invitation?

192
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,670
Why does he still look disappointed?

193
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,910
Whatever.

194
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,200
Let's get down to business first.

195
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,640
(From the pictures,)

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
(it is observed
that the pictures center around)

197
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,760
(Li Mingcheng's company)

198
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,880
(for about a one-hundred-metre radius.)

199
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,590
(Obviously,)

200
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,910
(this area is also
where the photographer is situated.)

201
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,320
(We still can explain
about the outdoor pictures.)

202
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,550
(For the indoor pictures,)

203
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,320
(only the employees)

204
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,520
(can shoot these.)

205
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,760
(Who will it be?)

206
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,640
(By the way,)

207
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,910
(why do I seem more like a stalker?)

208
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,200
He's my husband,

209
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,910
but my pictures are not as good as others'.

210
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,470
(What does he mean?)

211
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,000
(Did Xue Zi send me
to approach Wei Qing)

212
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,960
(not only for the Art Biennial?)

213
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,550
(Well, although
he has tons of shortcomings,)

214
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,280
(I didn't notice)

215
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,000
(his weakness.)

216
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,230
Are you free?

217
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,400
Why are you wandering around

218
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,790
in front of me?

219
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,910
Wandering around?

220
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Can you see now?

221
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,640
Just a blot of shadow.

222
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,280
But it's better than before.

223
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,230
I can't see your face clearly though.

224
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,110
(This is way too)

225
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,790
(nerve-wracking.)

226
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,880
I can only try my best to solve this.

227
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,320
Pei.

228
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,440
Send me the address of Jason Wu's studio.

229
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,670
I'll pay him a visit.

230
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,470
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,080
(Wu Zheng Art Studio)
Mr. Wu never joins commercial activity.

232
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,840
Besides, you're asking
for a crossover design.

233
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,280
Can I meet him to discuss this in detail?

234
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,590
Just a few minutes will do.

235
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,230
I'm sorry. No one is allowed

236
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,710
to disturb my master when he's painting.

237
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,400
You address him as your master.

238
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,320
When did you become his apprentice?

239
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,640
Last...

240
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,110
Last year. What's the matter?

241
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,470
Aren't you curious about

242
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,960
the apprentices before you?

243
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,670
Dear.

244
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,030
Listen.

245
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't eat too many takeaways.

246
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,550
It's bad for your health.

247
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,200
Alright.

248
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,440
Did you stay up late recently again?

249
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,710
Look at your dark eye circles.

250
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,790
You just wouldn't listen to me.

251
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,710
Dad, I'm born with these.

252
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,670
Mr. Wu, a pretty senior is here to meet you.

253
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,710
Who is it?

254
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,150
Greetings, Mr. Wu.

255
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,030
I'm the representative
from Shangjue Jewelry.

256
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,230
I almost became your apprentice too.

257
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,550
My name is Zhou Shi.

258
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,320
Zhou Shi.

259
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,550
I remember you.

260
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,200
I wondered

261
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,230
why you didn't come.

262
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,400
Nice to meet you.

263
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,150
Do you still paint?

264
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,760
My skills aren't as good as before now.

265
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,590
But your hands feel like

266
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
it's been a while since you hold a brush.

267
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,030
I think that was

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,400
two years ago, in New York.

269
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,880
I saw your art.

270
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,470
You have great skills and talent.

271
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,280
If you persevered back then,

272
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,960
together with my guidance,

273
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,590
you would have been rather successful now.

274
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,350
That's a pity.

275
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,790
So, are you here

276
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,400
to talk about the good old days?

277
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,320
Are you trying to persuade me by this?

278
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,030
You're right.

279
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,550
I've long heard

280
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,320
that Mr. Wu treasures his reputation

281
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,150
and is demanding towards his partners.

282
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,230
But in my opinion,

283
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,320
you're only unforgiving
and harsh on the outside.

284
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,030
Maybe because

285
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,840
that you're rich in emotions,

286
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,960
you can't tolerate others

287
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,470
to take advantage of art at all.

288
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,590
If I can hold the same attitude as you

289
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,960
in treating your art,

290
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,790
would you accept

291
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,790
my offer?

292
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,200
I must admit it.

293
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,200
You're good at grasping the point.

294
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,230
But I'm not interested in

295
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,710
your age and experience at the moment.

296
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,110
I'm having a video call with my daughter.

298
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,470
Please see yourself out.

299
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,110
I...

300
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,230
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,910
A friend paid me a visit just now.

302
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,880
Wait a minute.

303
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,030
Is that you, miss?

304
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,440
Do you still remember me?

305
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,400
I'm the girl you saved by the lake.

306
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
It's me.

307
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,590
I finally found you.

308
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,110
Don't let her leave, dad.

309
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,760
She saved my life.

310
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,440
What?

311
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,470
Jason Wu agrees
to collaborate with Shangjue?

312
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,880
Yes, this is insider news.

313
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,550
They had signed the declaration of intent.

314
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,640
Shangjue has sent over
some designers for further discussion.

315
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,520
Looks like it's working well.

316
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,590
What a brilliant move.

317
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,910
Inviting a famous figure
like Jason Wu to endorse the brand.

318
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,880
It's even better than a joint exhibition.

319
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,880
Who's in charge of this?

320
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,590
Xue Zi's executive assistant, Cissy Snow.

321
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Who is this person?

322
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,590
She even convinced Jason Wu.

323
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,710
Mr. Wei.

324
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,960
It's time for me to leave work.

325
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,910
Hurry up and tell me now.

326
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,760
[Cissy Snow, Li Zi's special assistant]
Nowadays, she appears

327
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,520
around Xue Zi frequently.

328
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,440
She seldom appears in public

329
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,910
and has no social media account.

330
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,790
There's no information
about her on the Internet.

331
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,760
There are only a few rumours.

332
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
For example?

333
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
Rumour has it
that two years ago, with her help,

334
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,470
Xue Zi managed to lead the Snow Group.

335
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,880
So, she's important to her.

336
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,710
Her henchman.

337
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,200
Well, she does work like Xue Zi.

338
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,440
But she misses one step.

339
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
A declaration of intent is useless.

340
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,470
Xue Zi won't sign anything like that.

341
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,960
What do you mean?

342
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,110
Even if Jason Wu is
temporarily convinced,

343
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,470
one day, he will realize

344
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,520
that Shangjue isn't influential enough

345
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,350
to collaborate with him.

346
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,030
All we need to do

347
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
is to help him realize it
as soon as possible.

348
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,520
Didn't Shangjue sign a new ambassador?

349
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,310
It better go well.

350
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,640
Please edit Feifei's pictures nicely.

351
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,800
These pictures will be
used for advertisement.

352
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,400
Don't worry, the raw pictures are nice enough.

353
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,040
When the editing is done,
the pictures will be breathtaking.

354
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,040
Alright, next look.

355
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
You look awesome.

356
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,000
Feifei, your neck...

357
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,070
I'm sorry.

358
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,000
There's something wrong with the makeup.

359
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,070
We'll touch up her makeup.

360
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,800
Makeup?

361
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,640
This is obviously an allergy reaction.

362
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,950
I've never seen a model like this.

363
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,640
Why did you have
an allergy all of a sudden?

364
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,640
Have you touched anything weird?

365
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,230
I was going to ask you too.

366
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,110
(Mist spray that leads to allergy)
What are you doing?

367
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,800
(Was that the reason?)

368
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,680
No.

369
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,680
I need to ask them
not to share the pictures.

370
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,680
Wait for me in the car.

371
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,350
I'll send someone
to bring you to the hospital.

372
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,560
(Ms. Bi, thanks to you,
I'm in great trouble now.)

373
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,280
(Hey, that was just
a bottle of distilled water.)

374
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,830
(Besides, it happened days ago.)

375
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,040
(If you were allergic to it,
you wouldn't have had a reaction until now.)

376
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,280
(From the picture,
it seems like a food allergy.)

377
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,830
(Have you eaten anything weird?)

378
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,310
(But I have no food allergy)

379
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,280
(ever since I was a kid.)

380
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,470
(Have you eaten anything
you didn't eat before?)

381
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,110
That's good.

382
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,640
What's the ingredient?

383
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,640
I've never eaten

384
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,760
this kind of ice cream before.

385
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,110
It's just truffle

386
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,680
and white caviar.

387
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,590
Have some more if you really like it.

388
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,470
Was that the reason?

389
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,470
What's going on there?

390
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,760
Obviously.

391
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
A power failure.

392
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,680
Gosh, you scared me.

393
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,110
Is there anyone here?

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,760
Help!

395
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,680
Listen.

396
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,590
Delete all problematic pictures.

397
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,190
Check the crews' phones.

398
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,110
Not a single picture can be shared.

399
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,350
This is a violation of privacy?

400
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,110
Tell this to Mr. Xue then.

401
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,590
If the pictures are posted online,

402
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,280
you'll be doomed.

403
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,470
It must be hard to

404
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,760
check all the crews' phones, right?

405
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,280
How many people took the picture?

406
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,230
Not many. They're all crew members.

407
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,710
They probably won't share it.

408
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,800
It's hard to say.

409
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,590
An allergy can be a problem.

410
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,640
If someone blames this
on the quality of the jewelry...

411
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,040
Will our partner believe that?

412
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,640
Maybe it's the model's issue.

413
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,190
They won't believe,
but they won't take the risk either.

414
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,520
Especially for a person like Jason Wu,

415
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,880
who cares about his reputation.

416
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:18,300
(Wu Zheng Art Studio)

417
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,000
How is it?

418
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,590
Good job.

419
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,110
You can only bluff me now

420
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,880
just like that little fan.

421
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,190
You're this old,

422
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,070
yet you're teaching me to fold these.

423
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,310
A sincere heart can work wonders?

424
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,920
With your rate of recovery,

425
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,830
you can see her with
your own eyes in a few days.

426
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,230
It really can work wonders, isn't it?

427
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,800
I didn't want to see her anyway.

428
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,520
By the way,

429
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,160
the exhibition at
the Mountain Gallery Hotel...

430
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,280
It was closed last week.

431
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,800
But there's another exhibition in the city.

432
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,920
I've booked a ticket for you.

433
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,230
Two tickets.

434
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,760
I didn't say that I'd bring her along.

435
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,040
I didn't say that it was her ticket too.

436
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,070
Do you want to cancel it?

437
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,400
Or

438
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
do you want to invite her personally?

439
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,000
Is she here?

440
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,350
I'm sorry, Senior.

441
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,230
Master heard
some bad news about Shangjue.

442
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,040
He might need to reconsider

443
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,520
the collaboration with Shangjue.

444
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,040
Who leaks this out?

445
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,950
You're really childish, my idol.

446
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,800
What about you?

447
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,590
You wander around the hospital every day.

448
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Don't you have work to do?

449
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,230
Of course I need to work.

450
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,160
But I'm facing some difficulties now.

451
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,110
Is it troublesome?

452
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,710
It's nothing much.

453
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,590
I just got back-stabbed.

454
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,430
But it's okay.

455
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,350
I'm going to win soon.

456
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,680
At the moment,

457
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,350
I just need some luck.

458
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,040
(Luck?)

459
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,400
(That's easy.)

460
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,470
A sincere heart can work wonders.

461
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,640
You!

462
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,230
Thank you.

463
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,520
You're welcome.
I'm just repaying your kindness.

464
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,710
They may get you lucky.

465
00:22:36,953 --> 00:22:37,625
(Pei)

466
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,190
Mr. Wei, Shangjue gave you a call.

467
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,230
They wish to discuss
with you about the Art Biennial.

468
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,000
They can't sit still anymore.

469
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,110
Tell them that I'm up for a discussion,

470
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,160
but only with one person.

471
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,190
Pass the phone to Cissy.

472
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,280
Me?

473
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,040
The person in charge of
Yunma Group said so?

474
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,830
Yes. He insists on talking to you

475
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,000
and he seems firm about it.

476
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,830
Do you need me to pass you the call?

477
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,950
Yes.

478
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,880
Hello, is this Miss Cissy?

479
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes.

480
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,710
How do you know that it's me?

481
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,830
(Why does it sound like
there are two voices?)

482
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,190
(That's weird.)

483
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,430
(Why is there an echo?)

484
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,830
I heard that

485
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,070
you almost signed the contract
with Master Wu Zheng.

486
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,070
Too bad you didn't take the final step.

487
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,190
It was you, wasn't it?

488
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,520
That's no wonder.

489
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,230
I wondered why the information
leaked out this quick.

490
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,000
Which department of Yunma are you from?

491
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,110
Listen,

492
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,280
I won't let you go away with this.

493
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,110
You won't let me go? Sure.

494
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,800
Come and meet me in Yunma.

495
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,110
Just call out my name.

496
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,160
Fine.

497
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,110
What's your name then?

498
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,070
I'm Yunma's chairperson.

499
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,920
Wei Qing?

500
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,640
Did you leak out the information?

501
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,920
You're Xue Zi's assistant?

502
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,110
Well, it's running late.

503
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,470
I shall not bother you.

504
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,710
Goodbye.

505
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,160
Haven't the nurse told you that

506
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,190
although I can't see your face clearly,

507
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,950
my sight has recovered by half?

508
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,160
Do you really think that you can escape?

509
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,680
What do you want then, Mr. Wei?

510
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,230
Let's make time

511
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,640
to talk through our relationship.

512
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,590
My fan.

513
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,400
(Quick update. I've
contacted the management.)

514
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,710
(They're repairing
the electrical system now.)

515
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,190
(But they're not sure
how long this will take.)

516
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,040
(The probability of
a lift breakdown is minimal.)

517
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,880
(Yet you're encountering it.)

518
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,160
(What about)

519
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,920
(having accidents
while trapped inside a lift?)

520
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,710
(There's a strange guy in the lift.)

521
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
(For safety purposes,
I'm going to bother you.)

522
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,950
Hello.

523
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,310
Well,

524
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,830
I'm trapped inside the lift.

525
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,470
Do you have anything to say?

526
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,310
The signal inside the lift is quite good.

527
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,560
Don't you want to say anything

528
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,560
like you will always be by my side

529
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,710
until someone comes to my rescue?

530
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,920
That would depend on
your phone's battery level.

531
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,310
If I got murdered in the lift,

532
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,520
you won't let anyone on site leave,

533
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,230
will you?

534
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,000
You've remember

535
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,680
his face vividly, right?

536
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,560
Hey, it's pitch-black.

537
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,680
I can't see anything.

538
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,350
Besides, didn't you say
that you're having an allergy?

539
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,710
By the way,

540
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,310
kissing can reduce allergy reactions.

541
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,310
I've proven it myself.

542
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,880
Why don't you try it on somebody?

543
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,110
You're still talking about such a thing

544
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,350
at this critical moment?

545
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,040
Drama queen.

546
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,920
You think too much.

547
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,880
Men are visual creatures.

548
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,800
Who would get interested in the dark?

549
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,070
You better be.

550
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,230
But just to be clear,

551
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,040
don't you regret it
when the lights come back on.

552
00:25:59,230 --> 00:25:59,760
After all,

553
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,920
you will never get to be trapped

554
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,070
inside the lift together with me...

555
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,590
Can I ask you a favour?

556
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,590
What is it?

557
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,040
Treat it like you're
taking pleasure in helping others.

558
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,710
Try the method
that your friend had mentioned.

559
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,350
What kind of help is this?

560
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,760
Are you out of your mind?

561
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,800
I'm afraid of the dark too.

562
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,800
And you're having an allergy reaction.

563
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,680
Let's help each other.

564
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,070
Come on, since we have
nothing else to do.

565
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,350
Sorry to interrupt.

566
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,160
I'm sorry.

567
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,760
The surveillance camera
uses infrared technology.

568
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,710
Are you okay?

569
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
We're okay.

570
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,070
You arrived earlier than we expected.

571
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,920
It's you.

572
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,830
The woman who pretended
to be dead at the roadside.

573
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,590
Are you okay? You scared me.

574
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,590
Ning Fei.

575
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Stop taking pictures.

576
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,830
Seriously.

577
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,430
Stop it. Stop it.

578
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,520
Keep your phones away.

579
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
Do you know me?

580
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,310
Please leave.

581
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,680
Please leave.

582
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,000
Fei, is that you?

583
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,880
You've returned.

584
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,230
Stop your act.

585
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,110
Tell me. What was our
relationship back then?

586
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,680
Relationship?

587
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,800
Why didn't you ask that two years ago?

588
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,280
Why didn't you ask

589
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,190
when you first bumped into me?

590
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,830
Are you trying to keep a distance now?

591
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,110
Enough.

592
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,680
One sentence.

593
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Were we dating?

594
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,430
Stop the act.

595
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,000
No matter what happened back then,

596
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,470
forget about it.

597
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,880
As I've already forgotten all about it.

598
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,070
What do you mean?

599
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,400
I mean what I say.

600
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,110
By the way,

601
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,800
I won't fall in love with you.

602
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,110
You stand no chance at all.

603
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,880
Who cares?

604
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,310
I don't even care who you like.

605
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,190
Stop looking at me.

606
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,470
Listen.

607
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,430
I've already forgotten our past.

608
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,710
Stop pretending
that you've lost your memory.

who took you in two years ago,

Thinking back,

I was being too sympathetic.

613
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,680

Mr. Wei.

699
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,160
Didn't you say that you want
to talk through our relationship?

700
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,520
Why are we having afternoon tea?

00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,520
You, of course.

705
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,950
Why? Are you denying it,
since you're not in incognito anymore?

706
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,830
I'm Xue Zi's assistant.

707
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,920
Don't you worry
that I have an ulterior motive

708
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,310
for getting close to you?

709
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,310
Xue Zi is nothing to me.

710
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,110
I'm not worried about her.

711
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,760
Besides,

712
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,920
which corporate spy

713
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,110
would care for me like a nursing worker?

714
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,830
Well,

715
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,520
you must be in love with me.

716
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,350
Hence, you approached me personally.

717
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,680
For the sake of your hard effort,

718
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,880
I can give Shangjue

719
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,280
a chance for exhibition

720
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,230
at the Art Biennal.

721
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,800
Are you talking about

722
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,760
a joint exhibition?

723
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,920
But I have a requirement.

724
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That is

725
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,310
Yunma will join

726
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,430
the collaboration with Jason Wu as well.

727
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,590
You call this a chance?

728
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,920
This is a forced bond.

729
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,920
You're just as harsh

730
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,880
as rumoured.

731
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,590
After all, it's business.

732
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,350
Besides,

733
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,470
Jason Wu might believe in you,

734
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,230
but he might not trust your brand.

735
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,680
Shangjue alone

736
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
is not capable of handling this.

737
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,830
It's a different case if Yunma joins in.

738
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,160
At least in terms of public relations,

739
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,080
we won't commit
such an outrageous mistake

740
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,630
of causing a model to have an allergy.

741
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,080
You!

742
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,760
I never force others.

743
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,470
Do consider this carefully.

744
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,870
I agree.

745
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,040
That's quick.

746
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,630
Anyone with a discerning eye

747
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,840
can easily know which to choose.

748
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,320
Although you are blatant,

749
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,710
your suggestion makes sense.

750
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,280
This decision would benefit all sides.

751
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,870
Of course I would agree to it.

752
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,390
I look forward
to working with your side.

753
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,190
Mr. Wei.

754
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,670
What's wrong?

755
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,080
What level is this?

756
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,560
Level twenty and above.

757
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,470
Level twenty and above?

758
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,230
I didn't expect that although I can't see,

759
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,390
my body is still afraid of heights.

760
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,560
I'm having a cramp in my leg.

761
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,190
Since you're so helpful,

762
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,040
you should work for me.

763
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,840
Are you alright, Mr. Wei?

764
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
No.

765
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:34,910
Come on.

766
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,190
Slowly.

767
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,230
Mr. Wei.

768
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,600
I'm still here.

769
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,320
It doesn't matter.

770
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,630
I can't see anything.

771
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,840
It doesn't even matter
if you bathe right before my eyes.

772
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,630
Are you kidding me?

773
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,800
But I remember

774
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,150
that you can see, don't you?

775
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,430
Well,

776
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,040
I'm heading to the restroom.

777
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,630
I'll call for you when I'm done.

778
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,280
Wei An.

779
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,870
Send me a set of...

780
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,080
No, two sets

781
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,630
of outfits.

782
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,430
A set of woman's outfits.

783
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,470
Mr. Wei, you...

784
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,000
What are you thinking?
Look at my state.

785
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,600
I have no mood for such things.

786
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,560
Seriously. I fell twice a day.

787
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,910
(I really recover quickly
when I cooperate with the doctors.)

788
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,190
(The doctor is right.)

789
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,760
Mr. Wei. Mr. Wei.

790
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,630
Are you okay, Mr. Wei?

791
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,120
I've recovered.

792
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,120
The doctor is right.

793

Mr. Wei.

794
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,560
Can you pass me the bathrobe?

795
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,600
(How does she look like?)

796
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,430
(Never mind, I'll take a look later.)

797

(Or else she would say
that I'm taking advantage of her.)

798

Well.

799
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,630
