Are you confident with this negotiation?

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Latest news.

55
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,580
(15 hours to Wei Qing's birthday)
The companies retreated from the bid.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,439
There's a high chance
for us to win this bidding.

57
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,400
What about the price?

58
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,439
There's space for negotiation.

59
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,840
The stock price is now
lower than the valuation.

60
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:17,559
It's the best timing to take over.

61
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,159
Good job.

62
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,999
I thought you'd need some time to adapt

63
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,439
after you got back in the country.

64
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,880
I didn't expect you

65
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,279
to be in such a good condition.

66
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:28,880
Well,

67
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,959
I am married now.

68
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,640
I need to earn a living
and support my wife.

(Li Mingcheng: ex-rival in love,
current right-hand man, married)

71
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,080

72
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,279
What about Zhou Shi?

73
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,559
You keep checking your watch.

74
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,200
You're checking the time
of a foreign country, aren't you?

75
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,080
Mind your business.

76

It's okay.

Mr. Wei.

91
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,999
I'm sorry. What was the last question?

92
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,477
(What's your opinion)
We heard that your girlfriend

93
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:15,080
(on long-distance relationships?)
is studying abroad.

94
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,080
You sure have

95
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:17,839
a say in this matter.

96
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,480
A long-distance relationship

97
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,719
is good.

98
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,279
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,839
A suitable distance

100
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,320
keeps us rational.

101
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
We will also have time and energy

102
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,239
to mind our own business.

103
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,040
We can balance our work
and relationship.

104
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,119
Isn't that great?

105
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,600
Are you joking?

106
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,839
Are you serious about this?

107
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,719
Which couple would prefer
to have a long-distance relationship?

108
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,679
We're now in the 5G era.

109
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:48,760
As long as there's internet,

110
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,200
you can see me whenever you want.

111
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,760
It's pointless
if I can't even touch you.

112
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Talk nicely.

113
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,320
I mean,

114
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,719
if the connection is poor,

115
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
are you going to

116
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,559
have a laggy date with me?

117
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:00,399
Besides,

118
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,239
what if there's no signal?

119
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,880
What if someone bullies you?

120
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,760
What if...

121
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,800
(I miss you?)

122
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,880
Won't you miss her?

123
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,760
Since this is our choice,

124
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,839
we're mentally prepared.

125
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,959
Won't you feel sullen

126
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,839
when you can't meet each other?

127
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,800
No, I won't.

128
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,320
Digital communication is advanced now.

129
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,999
We can video call each other anytime.

130
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:22,959
If she rejects your call,

131
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,279
would you mind?

132
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,640
Absolutely no.

133
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,559
I always have to call you, huh?

134
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,600
I'm about to sleep. What's wrong?

135
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,760
What's wrong?

136
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,480
Did you forget

137
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,800
what day today is?

138
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,959
Mate,

139
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,360
I've been occupied by assignments.

140
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
How would I remember what day today is?

141
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:46,439
Besides, it's past midnight now.

142
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,480
That's why I'm calling you at this hour.

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
You really don't remember, do you?

144
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,040
I only remember that I haven't
been asleep for more than 10 hours.

145
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,200
Please, I beg you. Let me sleep.

146
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,800
Zhou Shi!

147
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,640
Don't yell.

148
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,360
By the way,
I won't be coming back this time.

149
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,959
I've sent you a gift.

150
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,279
Don't forget to collect it.

151
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,470
(Five hours to Wei Qing's birthday)

152
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,239
She has been abroad for over a year.
Our calls are getting less frequent

153
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,839
and our video calls are getting shorter.

154
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,360
We seldom contact each other

155
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,959
and she rarely updates her social media.

156
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,320
She wouldn't even return for holidays.

157
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,760
What's wrong with her?

158
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,999
She's just

159
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,640
too occupied with her studies.

160
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,640
Wrong.

161
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,959
This means that she had too much fun
and had forgotten about me.

162
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,880
I shouldn't have
allowed her to go abroad.

163
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,360
You said so back then,

164
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,040
but you still let her leave.

165
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,159
I had too much confidence
in myself back then.

166
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,320
I thought a long-distance relationship
wouldn't be a problem.

167
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,200
But I realize I was wrong.

168
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,399
(The obstacle between us)

169
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,880
(was never distance.)

170
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,279
(It is time.)

171
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,399
Time?

172
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,600
Communication takes account of time.

173
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,999
When we are

174
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:58,520
not in the same time zone,

175
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,239
as time goes by,

176
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,399
we might not be

177
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:03,600
in the same space anymore.

178
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,920
I disagree.

179
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,679
According to the spacetime theory,

180
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,760
a 3D object

181
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,239
needs to overcome two time axes

182
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,640
or more

183
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,839
in order to become a 5D object...

184
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,239
A long-distance relationship

185
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,640
is good in a way too.

186
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,200
There's an old saying.

187
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,559
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

188
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,679
Do you know what comes after that?

189
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,920
Great absence
makes the heart grow apart.

190
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,399
Well, there are

191
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,159
many types of distance.

192
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,679
From the mathematics

193
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,119
and physics perspectives...

194
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,480
That's enough, Mingcheng.

195
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,480
You're a science student.

196
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,119
Stop minding an art student's business.

197
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,479
I'm really furious now.

198
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,760
Forcing her to stay

199
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,239
is not the right thing to do,
to begin with.

200
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,479
Besides,

201
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,679
you tried that half a year ago.

202
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,439
I was too soft-hearted.

203
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,880
I went to her,

204
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,640
but I couldn't bear to do so.

205
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,960
If I am to do this now...

206
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
What would you do?

207
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,640
Even if she apologizes to me,

208
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,679
I won't talk to her.

209
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,080
Who is it?

210
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,679
Parcel?

211
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,400
I'm outside.

212
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,919
Where's my parcel?

213
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:27,957
(Hey!)

214
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,280
(If you dare to leave now,)

215
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,760
I'll not talk to you anymore.

216
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,999
I know.

217
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,599
You've recovered now,

218
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,999
so you are free to date anyone you like.

219
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,039
Congratulations.

220
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,599
Are you going to leave just like that?

221
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,280
Don't you have anything to say to me?

222
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,200
I'll be back soon.

223
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:46,479
So, don't go anywhere.

224
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,840
Aren't you not coming back?

225
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,919
You put on a show in the video call?

226
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,400
Well, not entirely.

227
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,320
At least I did take a long flight
to get here.

228
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:04,439
It was really exhausting.

229
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,999
When I was in the car,

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,880
the driver thought that I was mad.

231
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,919
How is it? My acting was great, right?

232
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,919
You're good with the voice changer app.

233
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,039
You sounded like a delivery guy.

234
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,439
Don't be mad.

235
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,439
I send myself back.

236
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,960
How do you feel seeing me?

237
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,119
Nothing.

238
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,280
Not even a little surprised?

239
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,799
Childish.

240
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,320
Wait for me.

241
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Happy birthday.

242
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,599
Happy birthday.

243
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,280
How is it?

244
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,039
I have a good memory, right?

245
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
So, you're back for...

246
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,080
For your birthday, of course.

247

248
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,520

Topic.

319
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,080
About whether should you

320
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,999
give your cat a collar to wear

321
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,720
for identification purposes?

00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:58,119
Are you laughing at me?

323
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,119
Are you thinking that I'm making a fuss?

324

At least feed your cat some meat.

328
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,439
Enough. You have a marriage certificate.

329

335
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:28,320
we play chess,
do research, and play games.

00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:30,760
We don't have time for other things.

338
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,679
Why did you get married then?

339
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,840
This is a good question.

340
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,320
Let's start with the source

341
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:40,599
of the marriage system.

342
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,640
(Actually, it's not complicated at all.)

343
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,919
(As Miss Brainiac, Bi Qiujing,)

344
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,439
(is uninterested in dating somebody.)

345
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,160
(As it happens,
the man who proposed to her)

346
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,320
(is a peculiar brainiac too.)

347
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:52,479
Marry me.

348
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,679
Compared to dating,

349
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,239
marriage is full of variables.

350
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,239
The problems and obstacles
that we are to face

351
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:00,559
will elevate immensely.

352
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,720
But at the same time...

353
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,520
The fun will increase too.

354
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,919
That's right.

355
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,119
Well, do you want to

356
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,080
experience the fun of marriage with me?

357
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,840
(But after she got married,
Bi Qiujing realized)

358
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,559
(that she was tricked.)

359
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,840
(Those married couples in dramas)

360
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,520
(will always encounter trivial matters,)

361
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,479
(like in-law conflict or soapy incest.)

362
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,100
(You've received 10,000 yuan.)
(She encountered none of these.)

363
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,559
(Li Mingcheng hands over his salary
to his wife and does house chores.)

364
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,999
(He settles everything on his own.)

365
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,119
(The elite gamer, Bi Qiujing,)

366
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,039
(feels emptier than ever.)

367
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,439
It makes sense too.

368
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,239
He can't be the only elite gamer.

369
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,599
Where are you going?

370
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,880
To do a research project.

371
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,239
Are you feeling hungry?

372
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,039
A little.

373
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,679
Wait a minute.

374
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Hold on.

375
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
You can cook later.

376
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,280
I have a question.

377
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,239
There's something

378
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,080
even more important than eating?

379
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,239
In your opinion,

380
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,999
am I considered your wife?

381
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,479
Why do you ask?

382
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,679
I just feel that I'm occupying

383
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,599
a married status,

384
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,640
but I didn't fulfill
the duties of being a wife.

385
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm just taking advantage of you

386
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,679
and this is against my principle.

387
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,320
Is this your concern?

388
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:24,640
So?

389
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,119
Hence, from now on,

390
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,840
I'll face my title as your wife.

391
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,880
I will repay you what I've owed you

392
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,439
over the past year.

393
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,640
For instance?

394
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,999
For instance...

395
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Feifei.

396
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,340
(Kissing can reduce skin allergy)
Where are Miss Brainiac and Mingcheng?

397
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,320
Aren't you at their place?
Where are they?

398
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,799
They're doing research next door.

399
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,640
At this hour?

400
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,720
How hardworking.

401
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:54,999
What project is that?

402
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,200
It's not itchy anymore.

403
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,119
Seems like the argument is right.

404
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,640
It's a success.

405
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,999
So,

406
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,359
are you doing an experiment?

407
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,280
Yes.

408
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,640
Funny Nobel Prize 2015.

409
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,160
I'm experimenting with it on you.

410
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,199
Don't mind them.

411
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,040
You're not married yet.

412
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,880
Why do you mind their business?

413
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,760
What about you?

414
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,119
You're not married yet as well.

415
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:31,239
I would like to,

416
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,400
but there's no suitable candidate.

417
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,599
Let's not talk about me.

418
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,359
How is it?

419
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,599
Did Mr. Wei do anything
in response to your return?

420
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,999
What could he do?

421
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,479
A marriage proposal.

422
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:43,999
You've been dating for years.
If he still doesn't propose to you,

423
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,999
there must be something wrong with him.

424
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,319
Forget about it.

425
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,640
An arrogant man like Wei Qing

426
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,959
would never propose to me.

427
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,440
Not a chance. Besides,

428
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,359
my future is uncertain.

429
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,800
I don't know
if I'll return after graduation.

430
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
How so?

431
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,500
(Wu Zheng Art Studio)

432
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,119
Jason Wu.

433
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,920
Is he the famous oil painting artist?

434
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:05,760
He's interested in buying my painting?

435
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:06,760
Not only that,

436
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,359
Mr. Wu said

437
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,359
that he thinks
you have great potential for painting.

438
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,400
He hopes

439
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,920
that you can join his team.

440
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,119
Are you interested

441
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,599
in joining his studio as an intern?

442
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,079
This is good news.

443
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,760
If you get to work with Mr. Wu,

444
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,400
you'll achieve better outcomes.

445
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,040
It's a rare opportunity.

446
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,560
But if that's the case,

447
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,760
I won't be able
to return in a few years.

448
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,599
That's true.

449
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,400
What's your plan?

450
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,359
Before I make my decision,

451
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,400
I don't plan to let him know yet.

452
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,040
Did she just hang up on me?

453
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,359
Seriously.

454
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,300
(Wildcat: Come over to the cafe.)

455
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,079
When did you arrive?

456
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,160
I noticed
that you were not in your bedroom,

457
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,800
so I came down for you.
It's been a while.

458
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,160
Did you hear what I said?

459
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,239
I'm not interested at all.

460
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,640
You must be talking about

461
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,839
the girly gossip.

462
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:06,959
Wait a minute.

463
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,839
Have you just
talked behind my back again?

464
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:13,760
We said that you would never propose.

465
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,520
Or would you?

466
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,079
Of course not.

467
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,680
Well, great.

468
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,479
I didn't expect you to propose either.

469
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,920
You're really asking too little of me.

470
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,319
Well.

471
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,599
Ever since I know you,

472
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,440
you're not asking for my money,
nor my good looks.

473
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,760
Sometimes I think

474
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,119
that I seem like a decoration.

475
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,839
What's the point of you

476
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,040
getting a boyfriend then?

477
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,199
What's the matter?

478
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,119
I'm asking for this, of course.

479
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,199
Fool.

480
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,839
You're smooth-tongued now.

481
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,479
Hold on.

482
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,920
Who taught you
to say such cringey words?

483
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,440
I'm still having jet lag.
Lend me your thigh.

484
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,280
Are you changing the topic?

485
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,460
(Semood)

486
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,839
Did you decorate this?

487
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,319
It does feel like winter.

488
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,359
The only thing missing is snow.

489
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,319
There is snow.

490
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,560
Why does it smell like mandarin oranges?

491
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,959
Did you switch on the humidifier?

What are you doing?

506
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,119
Making a wish.

507
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,440
Listen.

508
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,800
My birthday wish this year

509
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,640
is to get another girlfriend.

510
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,319
What? You...

511
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,800
Her name is...

512
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:12,319
Zhou Shi.

513
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:17,800
She can realize her dreams,

514
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,479
travel the world

515
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,119
without worry,

516
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,239
and live the life she wants
as she pleases.

517
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,599
But you need to

518
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,719
return me the Zhou Shi I used to know.

519
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,440
Can you just

520
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,560
stay by my side?

521
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,359
I...

522
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,599
Okay, I've done making a wish.

523
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,999
Alright, we've had enough fun today.

524
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,079
You should go back.

What about you?

526
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,160
I still need to clean this up.

527
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,400
By the way, how did you

528
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,680
control the explosion of the balloons?

529
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,920
As the mandarin orange peel

530
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,199
contains limonene oil,
which can dissolve...

531

Stop.

532
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,520
It's Bi Qiujing again, isn't it?

533
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,800
Okay, hurry up and go back.

Goodbye.

536
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,319
Miss Lin, Ms. Xue wishes to see you.

537
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,440
Are you available to talk?

538
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,599
Ms. Xue wants us
to pass this message to you.

539
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,040
There's progress on the matter

540
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,400
you've been investigating on.

541
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,479
If you wish to know, come with us.

542
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,880
Sure, but before that,

543
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,319
I need to meet someone.

544
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,359
No.

545
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,280
Ms. Xue instructed us
to bring you to the airport right away.

546
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:42,719
What if I insist?

547
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,239
Who is this fool

548
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,880
that sends messages at this hour?

549
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,560
Something happened to Fei.

550
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,640
Xue Zi sent someone to get him.

551
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,079
They're going to catch the last flight.

552
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
I'm going to save him.

553
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,440
What can you do alone?

554
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,800
I'll go with you.

555
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:04,520
Okay.

556
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,040
How long does it take
to reach the airport?

557
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,440
About half an hour.

558
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,560
There's no traffic jam. It'll be quick.

559

Fei is going home.

561

From now on,

562
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,719
he won't be bothering you anymore.

564

You don't need to know.

565
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,680
Anyway, after tonight,

566
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,599
he will have nothing to do with you.

567
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,239
This person must be blind!

568
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:48,959
Get off the car.

569
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:49,800

You've decided to take him away.
