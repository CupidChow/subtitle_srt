20
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,400
I never would've expected this.

21
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,400
Xue Zi's trump card
was actually Ning Fei.

22
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,230
So long as Ning Fei
is under her control,

23
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,950
and with the diary,

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,270
my guess is

25
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,270
that it will be very hard

26
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,680
to take them down again.

27
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,360
There's one more way.

28
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,510
We just have to prove

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,080
that this Ning Fei is fake.

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,230
That he's a patient who hasn't
regained his memory.

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,000
That's right.

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,230
As long as he hasn't remembered,

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,360
then the contract he signed
is deemed void.

34
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,110
We just have to prove

35
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,110
that he's still

36
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,750
suffering from amnesia.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,600
But Fei has been

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,600
undergoing psychotherapy overseas.

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,830
The treatment records are with Xue Zi.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Such proof

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,800
can be done in the country too, right?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
We could ask Dr. Chen.

43
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,800
It won't be a problem
to ask Dr. Chen to help.

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,670
But why would Xue Ning cooperate with us

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,160
to provide the proof?

46
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,160
Unless we get a court order

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,630
to make him do a psychiatrist evaluation.

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,550
But that is a complicated process.

49
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,110
The matter would've
simmered down by then.

50
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,390
It won't work.

51
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,320
Besides, even if we can prove
that Ning Fei

52
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,750
hasn't regained his memory,

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,750
Xue Zi still has the diary.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,320
That is her actual trump card.

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,550
I think

56
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,960
we should ask

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,110
Dr. Chen about it.

58
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,160
An expert's opinion is more useful.

59
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,630
A court-ordered psychiatric evaluation

60
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,240
does need due process.

61
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
Moreover, Ning Fei

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
is quite a popular artist.

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,360
Doing it will have a direct impact

64
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,630
on his art career.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
That

66
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,320
will be our last resort.

67
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,000
Is there any other way?

68
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,390
Yes.

69
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,320
Bring him to me.

70
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll conduct an evaluation.

71
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,190
This way,

72
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,000
he will have a new treatment record.

73
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,190
If we could bring him here,

74
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,910
there would be
three of us sitting here today.

75
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,080
I trust that you'll find a way.

76
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,880
A respected senior
in the art world, Wei Heng,

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,470
has thrown off his mask

78
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,910
and exposed his ugly true colors.

79
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,910
How will Yunma Group,

80
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,160
the company he had set up

81
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,630
by embezzling the copyright
of his deceased close friend,

82
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
(continue to operate in the industry?)

83
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,910
(We are all waiting)

84
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,270
(for Yunma Group's Chairman Wei's)

85
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,720
(public statement.)

86
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,750
It can't go on like this.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,440
The current public sentiment

88
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,390
is all negative.

89
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,000
Stealing artwork

90
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,390
is the worst thing that could happen
in this industry.

91
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
Perhaps you should lay low for a bit.

92
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,960
Lay low?

93
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,630
Where am I supposed to go?

94
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,190
If I leave now,

95
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,030
that will be exactly what they want.

96
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,110
I've asked the PR Department
to prepare a statement.

97
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,270
We're going to expose
Xue Zi's real intention.

98
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,950
Take a look when it's ready.

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
Don't release the statement yet.

100
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,480
I don't want to get Ning Fei involved.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,320
Don't you think

102
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,510
Zhou Shi and the rest
are kind of weird lately?

103
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,440
Are they?

104
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,670
I feel like

105
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,880
Zhou Shi is hiding something from me.

106
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,480
Lin Feifei too.

107
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,320
And your brainiac wife.

108
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,200
Somehow, after the incident,

109
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,440
they all seemed pretty unperturbed.

110
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,040
Are you sure?

111
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,920
They're all very concerned.

112
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,350
Particularly Feifei.

113
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,950
You saw her slapping Fei.

114
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,200
To her,

115
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,790
it must be a huge blow.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,160
I still think it's a little odd.

117
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,600
Should we ask them?

118
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,110
Not now.

119
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,920
They must have a reason

120
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,270
for not telling us.

121
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,670
Let's just trust that Zhou Shi

122
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,350
would be able to resolve the matter.

123
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,790
We'll wait and see.

124
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,720
Understood.

125
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,880
I'll get PR to handle the media.

126
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,880
We'll minimize the negative press.

127
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll get going then, sir.

128
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,950
Okay.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,640
What exactly are you guys up to?

130
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,000
(We want to see Mr. Wei.)

131
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,920
(Please calm down.
When the time is right,)

132
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,070
(Mr. Wei will give a public statement.)

133
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,390
(Please give us a little more time.)

134
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,440
What should we do?

135
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,950
I didn't expect things
to blow up like this.

136
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,600
Are we still going to keep it
from Wei Qing and the rest?

137
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,670
I'm feeling hesitant too.

138
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,640
I only wanted them to know

139
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,230
how it felt to be kept in the dark.

140
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,040
With the current situation,

141
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,600
letting it drag on

142
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
will only cost a huge loss to Yunma.

143
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,270
We need to resolve it quickly.

144
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,480
Feifei.

145
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,720
Did Fei contact you?

146
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,160
No.

147
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,160
We can only hope

148
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,640
that Fei finds the diary soon,

149
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,040
reveals the truth

150
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,510
and proves Wei Qing's innocence.

151
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,640
Or else our act
would've been for naught.

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,790
Where are you going?

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,670
I'm going to feel Xue Zi out.

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,670
She should be waiting for my reaction.

155
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,480
Then try to look frazzled.

156
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,320
You have to convince Xue Zi

157
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,640
that we're lost.

158
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,320
That way, Fei will have a bigger chance.

159
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,270
Okay.

160
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,230
All the best.

161
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm off.

162
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,600
It's alright.

163
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,000
Come in.

164
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,070
Ms. Xue.

165
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,040
We need your signature on this.

166
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,110
Leave it there.

167
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,550
Anything else?

168
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,510
Ms. Xue.

169
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,230
Why did you do that?

170
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,000
Are you trying to stand up for Wei Qing?

171
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,320
Don't forget.

172
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,070
As long as you're an employee of Snow,

173
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,160
you work for me.

174
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,950
Don't become a traitor.

175
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,270
Ms. Xue.

176
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,760
You got to work with Wei Qing

177
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,230
thanks to my help.

178
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,830
You also gave me your word

179
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,440
about cooperating with Yunma.

180
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,510
Now what?

181
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,000
Wei Qing treated you as an ally,

182
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,510
but you stabbed him in the back.

183
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,950
In your opinion,

184
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,950
anything can be used

185
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,040
to get what you want.

186
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,270
In business,

187
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,230
it's normal to merge and separate.

188
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,000
Yunma annexed Shangjue.

189
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,670
Is that what an ally should do?

190
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,880
Also, Fei is my little brother.

191
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,950
His matter is my matter.

192
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,760
How could I let his father's works

193
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,110
end up in a thief's hands?

194
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,070
He's not Ning Fei!

195
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,600
Who can prove it?

196
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,790
Zhou Shi, I do admire you.

197
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,950
If you wish to remain at Snow,

198
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,830
you better know which side you're on.

199
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,830
Don't disappoint me.

200
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,150
You're back. The food is ready.

201
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,150
Why are you back so early?

202
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,350
The office was swarming with reporters,

203
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,880
so I left earlier.

204
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,910
I saw the live streaming.

205
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,200
Are you okay?

206
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm fine.

207
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,200
I've been through all sorts of trouble
over the years.

208
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,520
I can handle it.

209
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,280
Don't worry.

210
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,880
No matter what happens,

211
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,470
I'll be by your side.

212
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,710
Then come back to my side.

213
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,840
Leave Snow.

214
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,440
It's not the right time yet.

215
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,880
So when is the right time?

216
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,640
When the matter is resolved completely.

217
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,350
Looks like

218
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,910
you are very confident.

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,230
I noticed

220
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,400
that you've been hanging out

221
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,440
with Miss Brainiac
and Feifei a lot lately.

222
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,590
We are besties.

223
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,230
It's normal to hang out together, no?

224
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,150
Let's eat.

225
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,350
Sit.

226
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,320
You prepared a lot.

227
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,110
I'll try your cooking.

228
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,670
Dig in.

229
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,520
What is up with you?

230
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,910
Sneaking up on me like that.
You gave me a fright.

231
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,350
You're rummaging around.

232
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,230
For what?

233
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,640
What do you think?

234
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,910
It's because you hid all my snacks.

235
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,080
So I have to find them myself.

236
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,910
You remember my habit.

237
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,790
Yeah.

238
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,080
You always stayed up late
when you were abroad.

239
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,110
And you hid all the snacks
in the cupboard.

240
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,640
I have to go to work.

241
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,000
The housekeeper will be here soon.

242
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,550
Get her to cook for you.

243
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,550
Don't eat so many snacks.

244
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,880
Okay.

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,320
Lin Feifei and the rest...

246
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,200
They didn't contact you, right?

247
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,350
She keeps texting me all day.

248
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
And calls too.

249
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,670
Why didn't you delete her?

250
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,840
Do you guys think

251
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,440
Fei would be able to do it

252
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,320
alone at Xue Zi's?

253
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,790
What if something happened?

254
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,670
Fei is smart. He'll be fine.

255
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,150
Fei?

256
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,910
Fei, are you all right?

257
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm fine.

258
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,520
Did you manage to find it?

259
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,880
No.

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,280
I looked in all the possible spots,

261
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
but I found nothing.

262
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,150
I have to go. I can't be out too long.

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,880
I'll see you out.

264
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,550
If only we could go on like this.

265
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,590
Why are we

266
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,590
always separated
more than we're together?

267
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,710
Be patient.

268
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,670
I promise.

269
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,400
We'll be together very soon.

270
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,520
Go on then.

271
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,550
I, Lin Feifei,

272
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,080
won't be a burden to my boyfriend.

273
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,640
I'm leaving then. Wait for me.

274
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,030
Aren't I always waiting?

275
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,080
Listen up. You better come back quickly.

276
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,840
Or else I'm ditching you.

277
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,440
You're mine.

278
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,080
You won't ditch me.

279
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,470
We're stuck together.

280
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, stop.

281
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,320
When did you become so cheesy?

282
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,470
Alright, go now.

283
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,110
I'm off then.

284
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,350
Bye-bye.

285
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,670
You went out today?

286
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,790
No.

287
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,400
Ning.

288
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,440
Come here.

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What is it?

290
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,640
Can you explain this?

291
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,030
What?

292
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,520
Can you explain

293
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,550
what you were looking for?

294
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,110
It happened again.

295
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,280
Yes.

296
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,030
It happened again.

297
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,230
What do you mean?

298
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,760
Do you remember what I told you before?

299
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,230
Occasionally, I would recall
my past memories.

300
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,230
You mean, that time when Feifei
got you drunk

301
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,110
and you remembered your old memories?

302
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,670
Yes.

303
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,640
And before I remember things,

304
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,280
the me at that moment

305
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,710
has no consciousness.

306
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,470
It's as if

307
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,150
I'm sleepwalking.

308
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,960
Yes, like sleepwalking.

309
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,280
So you mean

310
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,470
the person in the CCTV

311
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,440
is the you that had
regained your memory?

312
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,110
I'm not sure.

313
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,440
Probably.

314
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,280
So you don't know

315
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,840
what you were looking for then?

316
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,550
I don't know.

319

From today onward,

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,160
you'll stay at home.

321
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,560
I'll get someone to watch you.

322
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,640
Are you grounding me?

323
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I am not.

324
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,680
I'm just worried about this
happening again.

325
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,160
We're at a critical time.

326
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,680
I don't want any mishaps.

327
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,470
I get it.

328
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,430
You claim to want to help me, save me.

329
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,590
But in truth,
I'm just one of your pawns.

330
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,920
They do it.

So do you.

332
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,160
Let me out when I'm of use.

333
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,880
Lock me up when I'm useless.

334
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,920
Is that right?

335
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,310
Fine, I get it.

Ning!

346
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,000
We're no strangers.

347
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,590
Let's just get to the point.

348
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,070
About the copyright.

349
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,590
What do I have to do to make you stop?

350
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,230
Zhou Shi's shares...

351
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,560
I'll take them all.

352
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,830
Impossible.

353
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,590
Then there's no negotiation to be had.

354
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,400
You must have full confidence
in winning this time.

355
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,640
What exactly do you want?

356
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,470
I already told you

357
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,160
what it is I want.

358
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,000
Also, another reminder.

359
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,350
I've destroyed the treatment records.

360
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,160
Mr. Wei, I must say

361
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,040
you're clutching at straws

362
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,680
and it's pointless. Also,

363
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,710
it only makes you look bad.

364
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,520
But your plan

365
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,040
is not all bad.

366
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,880
At least I'm entertained.

367
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,680
I want to go out.

368
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,280
Locking me up at home every day

369
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
is basically imprisoning me.

370
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Ning Fei.

371
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,400
My name is Xue Ning.

372
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Xue Ning!

373
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,160
To heck with Ning Fei!

374
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,640
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,640
I called wrong.

376
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,230
Hang in there a little while longer.

377
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
Very soon,

378
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,830
you'll be able to do
whatever it is you want.

379
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,350
How much longer?

380
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,400
It won't be long.

381
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,230
Wei Qing is being cornered.

382
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,880
Yunma's stocks have been dropping
for two days.

383
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,110
It won't take a week

384
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,640
before he raises the white flag.

385
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,520
Then, you'll be able
to go outside freely.

386
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,640
And do whatever you want.

387
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,160
So can I go meet Lin Feifei?

388
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,950
There are many more women out there.

389
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,230
Why must you fixate on her?

390
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,280
Because I like her. What's the problem?

391
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,430
As you like.

392
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,710
But I worry that Wei Qing
would put up a last-ditch fight.

393
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,680
They're probably
looking for you right now.

394
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,640
I plan to move you to a different place.

395
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,040
Where?

396
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,350
You'll know soon.

397
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,830
Also, I need your phone.

398
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,230
Why?

399
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,640
To prevent you from contacting Zhou Shi

400
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,430
when you're sleepwalking.

401
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,760
Go on. What else do you want?

402
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,680
Alright.

403
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Don't be angry.

404
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,830
I'll make it up to you.

405
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,680
Did Wei Heng
really cause my dad's death?

406
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,640
Yes.

407
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,710
It's written in the diary.

408
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,040
Then show it to me.

409
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,400
Once the matter is over,

410
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,350
I will show it to you.

411
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,230
You keep saying that.

412
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,280
How can I be sure

413
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,800
you won't destroy it?

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,920
Rest assured.

415
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
I hid it somewhere safe.

416
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,520
I'll give it back to you.

417
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,590
You better.

418
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,880
Although I hate them,

419
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,000
I despise those who lie to me more.

420
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,190
Alright.

421
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Go and sleep.

422
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,830
You'll leave early tomorrow morning.

423
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:12,275
(Press to shut down)

424
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,640
What should I do?

425
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,070
He said he'd contact me,

426
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,760
but there'd been nothing
from him so far.

427
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,590
Did he get found out?

428
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,950
Could Xue Zi have noticed it?

429
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,520
Did she get rid of him?

430
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,950
Calm down.

431
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,830
We're not filming a movie here.

432
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,830
Should I call him?

433
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,400
That would let the cat out of the bag.

434
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,950
But I'm guessing

435
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,590
his phone is already turned off.

436
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,880
You can try and call.

437
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,280
(Hello. The number you've dialed
is currently turned off.)

438
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,800
It's really off.

439
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,920
Miss Brainiac, what is going on?

440
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,280
I think Xue Zi must have found out

441
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,590
that Fei came to us.

442
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,190
So she set up a trap for us.

443
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,040
Now that you said so,
I am quite suspicious.

444
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,230
Right now,

445
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,880
Xue Zi must not want Fei to contact us.

446
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,800
She must have taken his phone.

447
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,110
Meaning Fei has been found out.

448
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,560
He's in danger.

449
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,800
No, I have to go get him!

450
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,110
Don't be reckless.

451
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,070
I don't think Xue Zi knows

452
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,710
that Fei has regained his memory.

453
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,560
So Fei will get in touch with us.

454
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,040
Are we going to just wait then?

455
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,800
Perhaps it's time
to tell Wei Qing the truth.

456
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,470
So your wife is at Feifei's too?

457
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,470
Yes, she left early in the morning.

458
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,350
I think your guess was right.

459
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,800
They must be hiding

460
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,760
something from us.

461
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,400
Every time I asked her about it,

462
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,560
she'd change the topic.

463
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,230
Your wife is not called Miss Brainiac

464
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,190
for nothing.

465
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,710
It's not surprising
you couldn't get it out of her.

466
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,590
Neither could you.

467
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,520
It's not that I didn't ask, but...

468
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,110
I know for sure she's hiding something.

469
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,830
How come?

470
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,800
She wants me to have a taste
of my own medicine.

471
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,590
Do you mean Shishi
is getting back at you

472
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,350
for not telling her about Xue Le before?

473
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,040
Not getting back at me.

474
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,400
Getting back at us.

475
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,230
But I was dragged into it.

476
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,640
She very calmly said
she trusted Ning Fei.

477
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,710
I'm guessing Ning Fei
is in it with them.

478
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
That's why you don't seem anxious

479
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,310
after such a big incident.

480
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm not anxious as long as she's happy.

481
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,950
When she's ready,

482
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,230
she'll tell me herself.

483
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,800
This is what they call karma.

484
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,000
Stop talking nonsense and get cooking.

485
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,400
Smells good in here.

486
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,040
Mingcheng.

487
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,310
What are you doing here?

488
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,350
Mr. Wei is feeling lonely.

489
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,950
He asked me to come to keep him company.

490
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,160
You two can go chat.
I'll do the cooking.

491
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,800
I was expecting the ladies' meet

492
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,830
to be a full-day affair.

493
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,160
Why did you come back so soon?

494
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,640
I have something to tell you.

495
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,760
Are you finally going to tell me?

496
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,350
You already knew?

497
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,560
I knew you were hiding
something from me.

498
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
But I don't know what it is.

499
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,760
So you noticed after all.

500
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
Well? Are you upset?

501
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,430
I'm not upset
as long as you're not in any danger.

502
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,310
I'm not in any danger,

503
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,000
but I'm worried Fei might be.

504
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,590
What happened to him?

505
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,430
We can't get in touch with him.

506
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,350
I'm hoping you can help us find him.

507
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,280
Okay.

508
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,710
I'll do my best, Mr. Wei.

509
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,950
I'll find him soon enough.

510
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,430
Okay, got it.

511
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,280
I asked Wei An.

512
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,110
He said Ning Fei
isn't at Xue Zi's place now.

513
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,640
He was taken away early this morning.

514
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,800
Where did they take him?

515
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,520
We don't know for now.

516
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,710
But I've asked Wei An to find out.

517
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,760
At least we know Fei is okay.

518
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,430
Xue Zi is a businesswoman after all.

519
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,830
She wouldn't do anything illegal.

520
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,070
I know that.

521
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,280
But without Fei's help,

522
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,160
it will be even harder to get the diary.

523
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,560
Ning Fei wants the diary?

524
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,470
Why would he be at Xue Zi's otherwise?

525
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,190
I know you kept it from me.

526
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,430
But

527
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,310
I know you did it for my sake.

528
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,880
It warms my heart.

529
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,310
See?

530
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,760
I didn't get angry
because you didn't tell me.

531
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,110
Now is not the time
to be arguing about that.

532
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,000
We need to hurry and find Fei.

533
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,190
The matter is not over yet.

534
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,430
Fei is still of use to Xue Zi.

535
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,560
So I don't think
she would've sent him far away.

536
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,400
But to ensure you guys don't find him,

537
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,520
it wouldn't be too near either.

538
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,400
What you said makes a lot of sense.

539
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,520
But it's useless.

540
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:51,400
(Zhang Shuai)

541
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,280
Zhang Shuai.

542
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,280
What is it?

543
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,160
Really?

544
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,800
We'll be right there.

545
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,920
Thanks.

546
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What is it? Is it news on Ning Fei?

547
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,470
He's at the resort.

548
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,040
You're all here.

549
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,070
Wu Xiao, how come you're with him?

550
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,710
I... I came to eat.

551
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,430
I know you came to eat.

552
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,040
What I'm asking is...

553
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
are you two...

554
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,680
Yes.

555
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,920
What do you mean by yes?

556
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,590
I haven't agreed yet.

557
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,310
It's a no then.

558
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,000
No? Are you regretting it?

559
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,400
So what am I supposed to say?

560
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,760
Do you need me to teach you that?

561
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Figure it out yourself.

562
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,590
Alright.

563
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,070
Enough with the lovey-dovey.

564
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,950
Where is Ning Fei?

565
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,950
Reporting, Mr. Wei. Ning Fei

566
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,430
is currently at my dad's studio.

567
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,280
Why is he at your dad's?

568
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
My dad said

569
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,830
he was Ning Fei's dad's junior.

570
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,710
They were close.

571
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,590
After my dad went abroad,

572
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,070
they fell out of touch.

573
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,400
No wonder Master Wu agreed
to work with Snow.

574
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,230
It's because

575
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,830
Fei is a reason he couldn't refuse.

576
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,520
So he's at the studio right now?

577
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,350
Yes.

578
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,280
This morning, the lady named...

579
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,400
named Xue Zi sent him over.

580
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,880
He secretly asked me

581
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,070
to get in touch with you all.

582
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,880
But because I was
caught up in the moment,

583
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,950
I forgot to ask for your contact number.

584
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,190
So I asked Zhang Shuai for help.

585
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,280
Thank you both.

586
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,280
This is really important to us.

587
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,230
Wait, what are we supposed to do now?

588
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,560
How will we save Fei?

589
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,640
Wu Zheng knows us.

590
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,560
He's not going to let him go.

591
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,310
What about this?

592
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,710
I'll sneak you guys in
through the back door.

593
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,710
You can then get him out.

594
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,350
What if your dad finds out?

595
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,310
Then what?

596
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,230
It's better to create

597
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,280
a diversion first.

598
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,590
Why don't I do it?

599
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,830
I don't think he knows me.

600
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,680
Everyone knows you and Wei An

601
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
are my right-hand men.

602
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,830
Surely he'll recognize you.

603
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,950
You'll never get to see him.

604
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,520
Am I really that well-known?

605
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,950
Who will go then?

606
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,590
I'll do it.

607
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,830
After all, we have the most entanglement.

608
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,310
Plus, our discord was on display

609
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,280
at the press conference.

610
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,950
I have good reason to show up.

611
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,070
But what are you going to say?

612
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,280
That I'm looking for the jerk.

613
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,310
As expected of my senior's son.

614
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,760
Your painting style
is just like my senior's.

615
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,590
Mr. Wu.

616
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,040
Relax.

617
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,590
Make yourself at home.

618
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,710
Mr. Wu.

619
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,830
You and my dad

620
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,190
must have been close.

621
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,590
We used to hang out together a lot.

622
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,950
Because we both came from
not very good backgrounds.

623
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,040
So we often pooled our money
to buy one meal

624
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,400
and we'd share it.

625
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,760
Seeing you reminds me of him.

626
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,110
But

627
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
I can't say I remember him that well.

628
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,640
I have a photo of him.

629
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,800
Sit.

630
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,760
This is your father.

631
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,640
Xue Zi said

632
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,830
you might have to

633
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,430
stay here for up to half a month.

634
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,430
Zhou Shi and Wei Qing
might come for you.

635
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,430
You're unable to see their true colors.

636
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,520
In case you got tricked,

637
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,070
she asked me to keep you here.

638
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:26,800
No.

639
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,110
Zhou Shi and the others
are protecting me.

640
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,800
They never tried to hurt me.

641
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,920
How can you be so sure?

642
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,880
They did steal

643
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,520
your father's artwork

644
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,800
and left him to fend for himself.

645
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,230
They made you an orphan.

646
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,350
That's not true.

647
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,800
Before he died, my father reminded me

648
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,110
to wait for Uncle to come for me.

649
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,920
Later, Uncle did come

650
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,590
and fetch me from the orphanage.

651
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,000
He raised me and taught me how to paint.

652
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,680
They're good people.

653
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,590
Are you sure?

654
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,920
That's not what your father wrote
in the diary.

655
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,680
You've seen the diary?

656
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,800
Xue Zi showed me some parts of it.

657
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,830
Is the diary with you now?

658
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,760
Can I take a look?

659
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,520
I'm sorry.

660
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,430
I can't show it to you now.

661
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,640
Why not?

662
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,470
It's my father's diary.

663
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,230
It should be handed over to me.

664
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,640
But Xue Zi left instructions.

665
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,640
She said this is for your own good.

666
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,430
Alright, give it a rest.

667
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,230
I won't disturb you painting.

668
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,680
I'll get you when dinner is ready.

669
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,400
Xue Ning!

670
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,950
Xue Ning!

671
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,640
Looking for you?

672
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,110
Why is she here?

673
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,950
You know her?

674
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,040
She...

675
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,190
is kind of my girlfriend.

676
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,760
King of?

677
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,110
You know,

678
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,920
something happened between us.

679
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,190
I have no idea

680
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,760
why she's looking for me here.

681
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,190
Should I invite her in?

682
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,400
No, no.

683
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,310
I don't want to see her right now.

684
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,070
Then I'll make her leave.

685
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,520
Xue Ning, come out!

686
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,590
You think I don't know you're in there?

687
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,470
Come out!

688
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,000
Stop pressing!

689
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,640
Don't you know

690
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,680
this is a private studio?

691
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,830
You're breaking rules here.

692
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm looking for a person
called Xue Ning.

693
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,830
There's no such person.

694
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,040
Then I'm looking for Ning Fei.

695
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,950
Who are you?

696
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,710
I'm his girlfriend.

697
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,830
Ask him to come out.

698
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,950
I want to speak with him.

699
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,760
He doesn't want to see you.
Please leave.

700
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,920
I'm not leaving.

701
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm going to see him today.

702
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,040
I want to speak with him.

703
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,070
If you won't let me see him,

704
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,800
I'll just continue yelling.

705
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,520
I'll yell until he comes out. Xue Ning!

706
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,230
Xue Ning!

707
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,560
Xue Ning!

708
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,920
- Xue Ning!
- That's enough!

709
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,800
If you won't leave,

710
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,760
I'm going to call the police.
Don't make me.

711
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,830
What are you doing now?

712
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,430
You're bullying me.

713
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,560
I... When did I bully you?

714
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,110
You can't just make things up.

715
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,470
You won't let me see Ning Fei,

716
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,560
and you threatened me.

717
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,230
You... You want me arrested.

718
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,830
He and you are both big bullies.

719
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,680
Miss.

720
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,160
I won't call the police.

721
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,560
Just leave.

722
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,160
I'm not leaving.

723
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,190
You have no idea
how terrible that guy is.

724
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,070
Before we started dating,

725
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,310
I broke one of his bowls.

726
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,520
I went to countless stores

727
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,560
and bought him a dozen bowls.

728
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,760
But he didn't want any and scolded me.

729
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,000
After that, we got together.

730
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,950
One time, I cooked him noodles.

731
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,160
But he said the noodles were poisonous!

732
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,520
Your noodles are poisonous.

733
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,640
When did I bully you?

734
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,190
I'm so pitiful!

735
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:18,750
(Study Room)

736
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,000
He left without saying goodbye
two years ago.

737
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,390
When he returned...

738
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,470
Thanks.

739
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,040
When he returned,

740
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,430
he pretended to have lost his memory
and wouldn't acknowledge me.

741
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,040
Tell me.

742
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,360
How could such a dramatic thing happen?

743
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,870
He just doesn't love me anymore.

744
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,600
So he wants to get rid of me.

745
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,430
(Why is it not done yet?)

746
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,600
(Did they fail?)

747
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,670
(I'm running out of ideas.)

748
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,280
Miss.

749
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,360
Later, that guy

750
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,910
tried to cheat me of my money
by pretending to have amnesia.

751
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,230
Tell me.

752
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,520
Why are you protecting such a person?

753
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,470
Why are you being his accomplice?

754
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,280
Miss, I...

755
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,390
I really can't allow you in.

756
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,470
You should leave.

757
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm not leaving today!

758
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,080
Are you really not going to let me in?

759
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,390
That's for sure.

760
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,360
Then I won't force you.

761
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,910
That's all. Bye-bye.

762
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,320
What was that about?

763
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,470
So weird.

764
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,760
Baby girl, why are you out here?

765
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,760
I came to check on you.

766
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,950
Has that person left?

767
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,870
Yes.

768
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,600
I'm going in then.
