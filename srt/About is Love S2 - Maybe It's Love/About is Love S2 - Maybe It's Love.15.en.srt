Your face...

19
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,260
What's wrong with it?

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,780
How is it so beautiful?

21
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,420
Clean your face and freshen up, Mr. Wei.

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,420
Enough with your monkey business.

23
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,540
Go out. I'm taking a shower.

24
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,580
Don't be such a downer.

25
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,540
Go out.

26
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,260
Go, now!

27
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,700
Mr. Wei.

28
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,140
I checked the contract Mr. Wu

29
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,180
sent me.

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,740
The page about the copyright

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,140
feels different when touching it.

32
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,820
Someone must have swapped it.

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,980
Are you sure?

34
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,740
I am certain of it.

35
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,020
It used a different ink.

36
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,980
The writings on the fake page
are lighter.

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,180
Okay, I'll be right there.

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,460
What's wrong?

39
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,820
Your beloved Mingcheng just called.

40
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,500
He said someone
had switched out the contract.

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,140
How may I help you?

42
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,020
Come on!

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,300
Do you not know me?

44
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,340
Honey?

45
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,980
Darling.

46
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,700
What happened to you?

47
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,300
Darling, are you alright?

48
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,580
I'm alright, Honey.

49
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,740
Darling,

50
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,940
are you feeling unwell?

51
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,260
Come on.

52
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,140
I am perfectly fine.

53
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,740
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

54
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,620
Is there sand in your eyes?
I'll blow it out for you.

55
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,900
Come on,

56
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,940
I'm alluring you with my blinking.

57
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,500
Blinking?

58
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,780
Honey, did you

59
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,660
not have dinner yet?

60
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,580
I'll make dinner for you.

61
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,540
But, when did you learn how to cook?

62
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,780
Recently.

63
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,500
Darling, maybe you should
take off the shoes.

64
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,260
Sure thing.

65
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,340
Take it easy.

66
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,260
Slowly. Have a seat.

67
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,860
Here.

68
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,860
This is so exhausting.

69
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,180
It's nothing, Honey.

70
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,980
I'll make dinner for you.

71
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,620
Darling?

72
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,700
Why are you carrying this?

73
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,100
For dinner.

74
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,380
Dinner?

75
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,420
Wait here.

76
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,900
Honey?

77
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,820
Come here.

78
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,660
I love you.

79
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,260
That didn't feel right.
I love you.

80
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,740
Kiss.

81
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,940
I love you too.

82
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,740
Honey.

83
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,420
Do you like how I am now?

84
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,620
Yes.

85
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,860
I'll make dinner. Wait here.

86
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,460
Dinner?

87
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Wait here.

88
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,100
This is so exhausting.

89
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,740
However, it seems Li Mingcheng

90
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,860
is very fond of this style.

91
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,780
I must keep it going.

92
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,180
Darling, you're amazing.

93
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,660
Honey, I made the soup

94
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,340
just for you.

95
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,460
This is the Ten-Herb Silkie Chicken Soup.

96
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,300
This is delicious.

97
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,180
Well, drink heartily.

98
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,460
Delicious.

99
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,380
Honey.

100
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,500
Your nose is bleeding.

101
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,060
Oh no.

102
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,700
Why is your nose bleeding?

103
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,260
I must have forgotten to use

104
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,060
the hormone secretion level

105
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,460
of a normal adult male in my formula.

106
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,260
Honey, are you alright?

107
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,980
Darling,

108
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,820
I know a way

109
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,540
to neutralize the excess tonic.

110
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,220
Do you want to try it?

111
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,220
I have some inner beauty for you to see.

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,300
Sure.

113
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,020
Sorry, Darling.

114
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,260
Wait here.

115
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,580
Honey, are you all right?

116
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,140
I'm alright, Darling.

117
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,260
Wait there. Sorry.

118
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,380
So, diarrhea is a way

119
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,980
to neutralize the excess tonic.

120
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,500
I just learned something new.

121
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,620
It seems I have no use
for my inner beauty now.

122
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,860
Miss Brainiac,

123
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,220
you look amazing today.

124
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,260
I never thought

125
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,340
I'd see this side of you, Ms. Bi.

126
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,500
What? I can't compliment her?

127
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,860
Fine.

128
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,140
Come in. You must be here
for Li Mingcheng.

129
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,500
Where is he?

130
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,180
Mr. Wei.

131
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Sorry.

132
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,900
I'll be there in a moment.

133
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,980
What's wrong with him?

134
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,300
Miss Brainiac, did you make this?

135
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,140
Ginseng and goji berries.

136
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Impressive tonic.

137
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,740
Miss Brainiac, what else did you make?

138
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,740
Could you show me?

139
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,580
Let's go.

140
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,060
It's indeed different.

141
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,420
It seems someone

142
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,460
switched this page out.

143
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Mingcheng, are you sure
you were the only one present

144
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,740
when you signed it?

145
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,940
Yes.

146
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,660
But when Rachel came to say goodbye,

147
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,340
I was away for a little while.

148
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,980
I only signed it when I returned.

149
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,140
If someone really

150
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,900
switched the page out,

151
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,060
that would be their only chance.

152
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,620
But Wei An said

153
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,340
no one went to
the surveillance control room.

154
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,500
It seems

155
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,180
someone tampered with the footage.

156
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,580
The dinner took a toll on you.

157
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,180
I don't know what's got into her.

158
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,300
Ever since she came back
from Feifei's place,

159
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,220
she's been acting
like a different person.

160
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,980
She insisted on making me dinner.

161
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,860
She was so strange.

162
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,660
What's strange about it?

163
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,980
It means Qiujing loves you.

164
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,700
You should feel happy.

165
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,140
I am happy

166
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,020
to have married her.

167
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Hold it.

168
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,580
Don't be such a show-off.

169
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,740
Perhaps

170
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,100
I should extend your sabbatical,

171
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,220
so you can enjoy
some romantic time with her.

172
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,500
It'll be even better to add

173
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,420
another person to this house.

174
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,260
What's wrong?

175
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,500
They are legally married.

176
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,180
Did I say anything wrong?

177
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,660
I think

178
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,500
we should resolve this problem now,

179
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,100
so I can get back to work
as soon as possible.

180
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,020
It won't be too long.

181
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,380
You can go back to work as soon as

182
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,620
we catch the mole.

183
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:46,891
Hello?

184
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,820
Alright, I got it.

185
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,700
Send him to the office tomorrow.

186
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
What's wrong?

187
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,460
Mr. Xue just called.

188
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,980
He's going to claim damages from Yunma.

189
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,060
Do you also think

190
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,900
Xue Zi and her brother
are up to something?

191
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,860
Also?

192
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,620
Even you noticed it?

193
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,900
I haven't found out

194
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,420
what their motives are.

195
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,940
Did you find anything on your end?

196
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,700
So far, I've found nothing.

197
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,260
To make it worse,

198
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,980
I'm not sure if the siblings

199
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,220
are joining hands to bring us down

200
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,540
or is someone else working against us.

201
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,660
This is why

202
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,100
I want you to leave Xue Zi.

203
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,740
I was worried she might hurt you

204
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,540
to get to me.

205
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,620
That's all the more reasons

206
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,020
not to leave her.

207
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,980
As long as I stay in the Snow Group,

208
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,300
I can find out

209
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,780
who is behind all this.

210
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,500
So, you're staying there

211
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,140
for me?

212
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,140
Nonsense. Get over yourself.

213
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,540
Fine.

214
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,260
If you ever run into any trouble,

215
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,020
you must inform me immediately.

216
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,420
Why are you letting me stay there now?

217
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,820
That's because I know
you have what it takes

218
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,340
to settle the problems.

219
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,460
I have no reason not to agree with this.

220
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,020
But remember,

221
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,860
Xue Zi and her brother
are very intelligent.

222
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,260
They won't trust you so easily.

223
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,020
To earn their trust,

224
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,100
you must make them believe

225
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,300
you and I are over for good.

226
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,500
You mean...

227
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,020
We must put up a fight.

228
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,460
You didn't have to come with me.

229
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,260
Given your relationship with Wei Qing,

230
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,700
this could be a little awkward.

231
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,820
Don't worry, Mr. Xue.

232
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,340
I work for the Snow Group.

233
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm also in charge
of the Asian Art Biennial.

234
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,180
It's my responsibility to be here.

235
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,420
Besides,

236
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,060
Wei Qing and I are over.

237
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,260
We are now acquaintances at work.

238
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,620
I was in a meeting.

239
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,140
My apologies for the long wait, Mr. Xue.

240
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,100
Not at all.

241
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,660
You're a busy man.
I came at the wrong time.

242
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,900
Are you here

243
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,260
to claim the damages from Yunma?

244
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,740
Yes.

245
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,100
The Asian Art Biennial

246
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,300
is a joint project
of Shangjue Jewelry and Yunma,

247
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,700
but the contract ran into trouble
on Yunma's end.

248
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,180
This has greatly impacted
the reputation and interest

249
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,100
of Shangjue Jewelry.

250
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,300
I think Yunma

251
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,780
should pay for the damages.

252
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,860
Well said.

253
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,380
How much are you asking?

254
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,780
Send this to the treasury.

255
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,380
Yes.

256
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,700
Aren't you going to read it, Mr. Wei?

257
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,780
Trivial matters do not
require my attention.

258
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,340
If there is nothing else,

259
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,620
you must excuse me.

260
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,380
Mr. Wei,

261
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,300
hold on.

262
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,100
Mr. Xue,

263
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,620
I must have a word with Mr. Wei.

264
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,820
I'll wait outside.

265
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,940
What do you want to talk about?

266
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,100
Mr. Wei, I must clarify.

267
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,500
We partnered up to approach Mr. Wu,

268
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,420
but it was for the sake
of both companies' interest.

269
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,060
It doesn't mean I forgive you

270
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,660
after you went to Xue Zi

271
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,260
and use me as your leverage.

272
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,340
The problem has been settled.

273
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,180
I hope I don't ever see you again

274
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,460
in Shangjue Jewelry.

275
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,340
I also hope
that you can stop bothering me.

276
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,700
What kind of joke is this?

277
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,260
Zhou Shi.

278
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,500
Mr. Wei.

279
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,260
Show some respect, please.

280
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,740
Can we go now?

281
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,540
Have you seen Feifei?

282
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,620
She's over there.

283
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,660
Thanks.

284
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,900
Follow up closely in this scene.

285
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,860
Yes.

286
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,860
Mr. Xue.

287
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,260
This is for you.

288
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,300
Thanks.

289
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,780
You seem to be in a good mood.

290
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,500
Did something great happen?

291
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,340
It's great

292
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,820
to see you again.

293
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,740
I'm flattered.

294
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,460
How may I help you?

295
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,660
I'm holding a private banquet
in a few days.

296
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,220
I need a date.

297
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,060
Do I have the honor

298
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,420
to ask you out?

299
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,540
A banquet?

300
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,900
She's not available.

301
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,940
What do you want this time?

302
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,020
He's not a good guy.

303
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,340
You should stay away from him.

304
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,140
What are you talking about?

305
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,300
Xue Ning.

306
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,700
After all, you're still
my younger brother.

307
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,540
You should mind your manner

308
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,380
when you talk to me.

309
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,940
You don't have a brother here.

310
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,100
Xue Ning!

311
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Mr. Xue, I'm sorry.

312
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,740
He's just a little kid.

313
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,980
- I am not a kid.
- Please ignore him.

314
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,500
Why are you afraid of him?

315
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,460
Shut it.

316
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,140
Mr. Xue, we'll talk outside.

317
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,300
You're not going anywhere.

318
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,060
I will

319
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,620
go to the banquet with you.

320
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,260
Very well. I will pick you up.

321
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,780
Rest well.

322
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,700
You need to leave.

323
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,340
What if Ning Fei refuses to let you go?

324
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,340
Are you still going?

325
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,700
You are not him.

326
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,220
(Don't Bully Me, President)
(Xue Ning, personal assistant)

327
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,340
You hate everything I do.

328
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,700
All you ever care about is Ning Fei!

329
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,300
What's so good about him?

330
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,820
Why are you so obsessed with him?

331
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,260
Feifei, who is this?

332
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,700
Introduce him to us.

333
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,940
He's...

334
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
I'm her boyfriend.

335
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,140
Does he live here too?

336
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,820
He is my...

337
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,340
I'm her boyfriend.

338
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,340
Who are you?

339
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,500
I am her boyfriend.

340
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,740
Whatever,

341
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,380
I couldn't care less about you!

342
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,220
Brat, I am warning you.

343
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,060
If you come home late again,

344
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,660
I'll make you pay!

345
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,820
Wait, why are you here by yourself?

346
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,020
Where is Wei Qing?

347
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
I thought you'd be at his place

348
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,940
for quite a while.

349
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,500
Wait, judging by that look of yours...

350
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,620
It's over?

351
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,380
It's over.

352
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,780
Again?

353
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,340
Madam, aren't you tired of starting over

354
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,460
after so many times?

355
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,540
(Dismissal notice to Mr. Li Mingcheng)
Li Mingcheng has been fired.

356
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,700
I thought Mr. Wei

357
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,900
would spare him for old time's sake.

358
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,060
No way.

359
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,580
There is a big loophole in the contract.

360
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,940
Shangjue Jewelry
is asking for compensation.

361
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,820
Even if Mr. Wei wants to defend him,

362
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,260
other shareholders wouldn't agree.

363
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,300
You have a point, but...

364
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,860
Mr. Wei.

365
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,140
You're here.

366
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,820
See which photo is the best.

367
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,100
The first photo.

368
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,220
Isn't it a little too plain?

369
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,740
My wife likes it.

370
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,260
Sure. I'll give it a pass.

371
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,940
Mr. Wei.

372
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,300
I'm here to finish the transition.

373
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,660
Why now? Are you in a hurry?

374
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,220
My recent dismissal

375
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,140
was much more formal.

376
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,380
Everyone got the email.

377
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,540
Indeed.

378
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,620
After all, you are a manager now.

379
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,380
They should show some respect for you.

380
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,340
This is my second dismissal.

381
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,340
Mr. Wei,

382
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,060
don't you have other methods?

383
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,500
It's an old trick,
but what matters is that it works.

384
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,780
I don't get it.
Why are you always struck with bad luck?

385
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,020
Why is it always you?

386
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,900
Perhaps this is

387
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,660
the so-called occupational hazard.

388
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,780
How about this picture?

389
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,180
It looks nice.

390
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,860
Shishi will like it.

391
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,100
Did you two

392
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,780
have a fight again?

393
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,220
What do you mean by "again"?

394
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,780
Our relationship is perfectly fine.

395
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,380
This hard drive

396
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,100
contains the security footage
from this week.

397
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,940
It's up to you to prove your innocence.

398
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,740
Thank you for trusting me, Mr. Wei.

399
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,060
Come on, spare me the mushy words.

400
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,700
You need to hurry.

401
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,300
When the mole finds out

402
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,460
they have a scapegoat,

403
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,940
they will surely make a move.

404
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,420
I can't investigate

405
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,620
all of my employees.

406
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,420
So, it's up to you to find the mole.

407
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,580
Understood.

408
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,060
I'll get it done as soon as possible.

409
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,780
This is it.

410
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,340
By the way, talk to the treasury

411
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,700
whenever you have the time.

412
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,100
You will be compensated.

413
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,980
Consider it my funding
for your vacation.

414
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,980
I'll leave you to it.

415
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,100
Alright.

416
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,020
Are you going out later?

417
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,580
I have a date.

418
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,780
I should get going.

419
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
Good luck with the date.

420
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,460
There are singular and plural nouns.

421
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,860
There are different tenses.

422
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,460
SVO structure.

423
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,540
Leaves, trunks, and branches.

424
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,900
It's you!

425
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,740
Using a password is so childish.

426
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,900
What do you know?
I am being cautious.

427
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,460
What if I mistook someone else for you?

428
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,900
You're not Superman.

429
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,380
People can recognize you
through the shades.

430
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
I could tell right away it was you.

431
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,900
I bought it for you.

432
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,900
Thanks.

433
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,860
How did you come up

434
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,500
with the idea of meeting
in a sightseeing monorail?

435
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,180
You've been so paranoid

436
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,380
and suspicious.

437
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,500
We're high above the ground.

438
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,740
No one will overhear us

439
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,380
or spot us.

440
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,260
I'm not paranoid.

441
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,220
As I said, I'm being cautious.

442
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,820
Did you find any leads

443
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,100
on the mole?

444
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,500
I released the bait.

445
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,860
Let's wait for the fish.

446
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,340
I've been monitoring Xue Le. He...

447
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,740
Alright, it's been a long day.

448
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Let's not talk about work.

449
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,380
Then what should we talk about?

450
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,660
Taking a break.

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,300
Let's see other ugly photos you took.

512
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,740
Give me the phone.

513
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,980
No way.

514
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:47,860
Give it back.

515
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,620
Here you go.

516
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,300
Zhou Shi!

517
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,460
Why are we back to this spot?

518
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,460
The weather forecast said
it would rain today.

519
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,060
We should head home now.

520
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
We can leave later.

521
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,060
I have something to show you.

522
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,180
What is it?

523
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,020
Ten.

524
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,740
Nine.

525
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,620
Eight.

526
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,660
- Why are you counting down?
- Seven. Six.

527
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,580
Are you

528
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,380
pulling another prank on me?

529
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,540
Four.

530
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,540
Three.

531
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,580
Two.

532
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,620
One.

533
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,260
♪I yearn for us♪

534
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,660

00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,700
♪I yearn for us♪

538
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
We are lucky to make it here

539
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,060
for the firework show.

540
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,820
What I see now

541
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,660
is even more beautiful.

00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,460
Did he run away from home?

548
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,820
Cursed brat.

549
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,620
Finally care to come home?

550
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,940
This is my home.
Of course I'd be back.

551
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,940
Come here.

552
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,700
Your feet are wet.

553
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,940
Take off the socks.

554
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,100
Do it now.

555
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,100
Wait.

556
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,620
What now?

557
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,700
Pick them up.

558
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,340
Do it now.

559
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,700
You jerk! How dare you do that!

560
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,020
- I'm taking a shower.
- How dare you!

561
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
- Stay right here!
- I'm taking off my pants.

562
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,060
Go ahead.

563
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,300
I've seen worse!

564
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,180
Go ahead!

565
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,860
Go on.

566
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,340
Pervert!

567
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:18,940
I'm warning you,

568
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,420
put your pants back on.

569
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,860
What in the world...

570
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,020
He's driving me insane.

571
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,420
I'm going to stuff the sock
into your mouth.

572
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,020
Who exactly am I?

573
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,020
Where am I?

574
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,740
(What do you see?)

575
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,620
I see nothing here.

576
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,940
The surrounding is all white.

577
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,300
(Help!)

578
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,500
My goodness, why is he bleeding?

579
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,100
Did he take his own life?

580
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,140
(What am I seeing?)

581
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,220
(The memories buried deep
within your mind.)

582
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,060
(These are the memories
you don't want to lose.)

583
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,940
The memories I don't want to lose?

584
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,820
Why are you in my bed?

585
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,620
This is my room!
Get off the bed!

586
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,860
Get lost.

587
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,220
Why do I see her everywhere?

588
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,540
Well?

589
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,020
What did you see?

590
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,380
A person.

591
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,460
And all my memories about her.

592
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,220
I'll take a guess.

593
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,260
Was it Lin Feifei?

594
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,340
Why her?

595
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,540
She was once the person
you loved the most.

596
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,220
You selectively

597
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,780
gave up on your memories,

598
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,340
but she is the only one

599
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,420
you refuse to forget.

600
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,420
What is so great about her?

601
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
She has a bad temper
and she always yells at me.

602
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,460
You saw every piece

603
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,780
of your memories.

604
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,100
You should have the answer.

605
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,980
However, I didn't expect

606
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,860
you would come here
for the hypnosis therapy.

607
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,380
My head has been hurting more lately.

608
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,420
The memories are pouring in.

609
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,060
Am I regaining

610
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,340
all of my memories?

611
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,340
Do you still refuse
to regain those memories?

612
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,260
What's so great about the old me?

613
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,900
I couldn't protect anyone.

614
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,340
Can you protect anyone now?

615
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,900
What you're doing now

616
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,500
is pretending to be strong

617
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,820
as a coping mechanism.

618
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,700
What you must do is to face the truth.

619
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,740
Solve the problem you should have.

620
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,740
Very well.

621
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,580
Another moral lesson.

622
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,780
I should get going.

623
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,660
By the way,

624
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,260
do not tell the others

625
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,820
I came here for therapy.

626
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,180
Don't worry.

627
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,020
That is your private information.

628
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,460
I won't disclose it to anyone.

629
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
What?

630
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,820
Don't worry. It's not food.

631
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,780
It's a coke and ginger remedy.

632
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,260
Is this for me?

633
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,620
Don't get it wrong.

634
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,300
I just don't want you to infect me.

635
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,100
Finish the medicine and wash the bowl.

636
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,780
I'm warning you.

637
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,460
If you don't come home at night,

638
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,780
don't bother coming back at all.

639
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,340
You're always so exhausting.

640
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,820
Finish it.

641
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,700
There is a whole pot of it.

642
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,260
(When you like someone,)

643
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,220
you'll feel like there is
a piece of cotton candy in your heart.

644
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,900
When you think of the person,

645
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,780
you'll fall into it.

646
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,500
The sweetness will strike your heart

647
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
and put a smile on your face.

648
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,020
You'd be wagging your tail
if you had one.

649
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,860
Did I say it out loud?

650
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,260
Is that how you see me?

651
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,860
Why don't you wag your tail for us?

652
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,420
I was just kidding.

653
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,940
I don't care, I want to see it now.

654
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,980
Hurry up.

655
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,620
You are so adorable.

656
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,820
That feeling...

657
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,580
It must be affection.

658
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,500
It's been a long day.
Have some soup.

659
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,580
Thank you, Darling.

660
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,780
Darling.

661
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,100
What soup is this?

662
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,100
Yellow pear and mung beans.
It cools...

663
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,100
It cools your body.

664
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,700
Then...

665
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,900
what is this thing in the soup?

666
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,660
I added some century egg slices.

667
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,700
Century egg?

668
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,660
Why would you put that into

669
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,820
the yellow pear and mung bean soup?

670
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,580
You've been losing your appetite.

671
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,060
You often retch.

672
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,700
The century egg helps with the retching

673
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,580
and improves your appetite.

674
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,620
It's also rich in protein.

675
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,140
However, it also contains lead.

676
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,780
Don't eat too much of it.

677
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,580
Darling, I...

678
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,820
I'm not very hungry right now.

679
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,820
Honey, I made this soup

680
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,660
for none other than you.

681
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,020
Do you like it?

682
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,260
Make sure you finish the whole thing.

683
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,260
The whole thing?

684
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,020
Thank you, Darling.

685
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,540
Honey, you're the best.

686
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,220
Darling.

687
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,580
Wait here.

688
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,860
This isn't right.

689
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,620
Does the pear also help
with bowel movements?

690
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,540
Honey, are you alright?

691
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,620
I'm feeling better now.

692
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,220
Take a seat.

693
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,700
Honey, wait here.

694
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,300
I'll get you some soup.

695
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,060
Wait.

696
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,860
I have work to do.

697
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,220
Can I finish it
after the work is done tonight?

698
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,900
Sure.

699
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,380
By the way, Honey,

700
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,060
your footage was edited.

701
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,940
I restored it for you.

702
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,060
What?

703
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,140
How did you spot it?

704
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,740
If a video has been edited,

705
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,740
there will be some frame rate spikes.

706
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,940
It's not very noticeable,

707
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,460
but I saw it nonetheless.

708
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,780
You're amazing, Darling.

709
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,060
I couldn't find anything
after watching it the whole day.

710
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,660
Why was he there?

711
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,620
Who is he?

712
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,620
He's my colleague.

713
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,180
We don't know each other very well.

714
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,060
Is it important to find him?

715
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,020
Of course.

716
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,740
I can prove my innocence with this.

717
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,180
Thank you, Darling.

718
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,180
Honey.

719
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,060
I'm glad I got to help out.

720
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,940
Thank you, Darling.

721
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,780
I must send this to Wei Qing right now.

722
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,820
(It seems I'm on my way to becoming)

723
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,060
(an outstanding wife.)

724
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,740
Honey.

725
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,700
I'll clean up the kitchen.

726
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,780
Okay, Darling.

727
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,820
(Lin Feifei)

728
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,460
Feifei?

729
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,900
Mingcheng, where is Miss Brainiac?

730
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,420
She is cleaning the kitchen.

731
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,260
Is something the matter?

732
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,300
I can pass her the phone.

733
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,260
Never mind. I just want to talk.

734
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,380
Are you satisfied
with her changes so far?

735
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,260
I've always been satisfied
with her personality.

736
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,540
Give me a break.
What I mean is,

737
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,300
do you love the current version of her

738
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,020
even more?

739
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,340
The current version?

740
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,820
Florine and neon,

741
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,700
sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon,
phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, argon,

742
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,660
potassium, calcium, scandium, titanium,
vanadium, chromium, manganese,

743
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,180
iron, cobalt, nickel, copper,
zinc, gallium, germanium,

744
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,540
arsenic, selenium, bromine, krypton,

745
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,580
rubidium, strontium, yttrium, zirconium.

746
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,620
Thank you, Darling.

747
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,140
What for?

748
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,060
I'm sorry.

749
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,220
You've done so much for me,

750
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,340
but I never realized it.

751
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,820
What are you talking about?

752
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,500
I don't get what you mean.

753
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,580
The way you speak,

754
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,380
the soup you make,

755
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,020
these are changes

756
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,020
you've made for me.

757
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,220
You know?

758
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,020
Feifei just told me everything.

759
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,820
Thank you, Honey.

760
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,260
Do you like it?

761
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,820
No?

762
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,340
I should try a different approach then.

763
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,540
No, what I mean is

764
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,940
you don't have to change yourself.

765
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,660
I like the real you.

766
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,220
But you always seem so tired.

767
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,940
I need to pay more attention to you.

768
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,540
I am tired,

769
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,340
but when I come home and see you,

770
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,460
all the work is worth it.

771
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,540
So,

772
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,460
don't change yourself.

773
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,060
Just be who you are.

774
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Actually,

775
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,060
I've reached my limit

776
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,460
for the experiment.

777
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,620
Even if you liked this version of me,

778
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,020
I would have to reject your request.

779
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,020
Do you want to see

780
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,940
the other side of me?

781
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,460
What is it?

782
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,780
Mr. Wei.

783
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,900
(Name: Wang Kang)
(Education and Practical Experience)

784
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,660
His name is Wang Kang.

785
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,660
He was working

786
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,220
in the Snow Group's marketing department
three years ago.

787
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,820
He only came here last year.

788
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,620
He kept a detail from us

789
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,860
during the interview.

790
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,980
I knew this was their doing.

791
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,580
Should I follow this lead?

792
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,540
I need you to find out

793
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,740
who is giving him the orders.

794
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,620
Okay.

795
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,460
(Calling: Zhou Shi)

796
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,980
