1
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,861
(sighs deeply)

2
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,114
(sighs)
Seok Jaebum.

3
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,158
(gasps)

4
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,833
Sooheon.

5
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,961
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,881
What is that in your hand?

7
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,550
This?
(scoffs)

8
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,553
-It's a phone. Can't you see?
-That's Park Wonseok's phone.

9
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,013
What?

10
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,098
I know for certain
that's Park Wonseok's phone.

11
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,100
Give it to me.

12
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,186
(suspenseful music)

13
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,749
Gi Osung.

14
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,710
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,755
Is that seriously
what you're concerned about right now?

16
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,632
I need to find out what's going on
in order to deal with it, don't I?

17
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,758
You're here because you got scared

18
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,219
after they sent you
that photo of Park Wonseok's phone, right?

19
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,512
I'm assuming you didn't realize Ji Sooheon

20
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,722
was following you on his motorcycle.

21
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,723
(scoffs)

22
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,725
This was all part of Ji Sooheon's plan.

23
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,561
I was with Sooheon
when I received that photo.

24
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,939
Then Ok Chanmi must have been
the one who sent it to you.

25
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,899
Since they're in on this together.

26
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,150
(scoffs)

27
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,321
Ok Chanmi was the one who sent it to me?

28
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,032
You're lucky I happened to see Ji Sooheon
when I was on my way to meet you.

29
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,368
By the way, why do you have
Park Wonseok's phone?

30
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,287
Are you trying to confess
that you killed him or something?

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,503
What?

32
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:22,976
(scoffs)

33
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,605
This is the phone I had lost.

34
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,399
Did you steal it from me?

35
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,569
I had to figure out
what you were up plotting

36
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,778
before planning my next move.

37
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,864
You should be grateful
for what I did for you!

38
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,658
Grateful?

39
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,829
Hey.

40
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,789
Did you know from the very beginning?

41
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,001
(scoffs)

42
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,711
(soft laugh)

43
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,795
(inhales deeply)

44
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,755
And when did you figure it out?

45
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,133
When did your memory come back?

46
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,679
(sighs)

47
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,681
Why isn't he picking up...

48
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,979
JAEBUM: <i>When did my memory come back?</i>

49
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,398
I knew as soon as I remembered
that it was you

50
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,108
who pushed me from that roof

51
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,694
and not Park Wonseok.

52
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,406
So you knew from the beginning, huh?

53
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,408
How?

54
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,203
How did you know it was me?

55
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,164
I may not have seen it
with my own two eyes,

56
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,665
but it's pretty obvious, don't you think?

57
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,418
-How did you know?
-Don't you realize what's important here?

58
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,545
You should be thanking me

59
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,464
for covering up
your murder up until this point.

60
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,548
(sighs)

61
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,635
(breathes shakily)

62
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,386
So what's your next move?

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,097
What are you going to do now that
that bastard Ji Sooheon caught you?

64
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,099
Answer my question.

65
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,435
How did you know it was me
that killed Park Wonseok?

66
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,646
Stop messing around
if you don't want to end up in jail.

67
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,317
You knew there's another person
inside of me,

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,693
and you took advantage of that.

69
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,489
You sneakily planted fake memories
when my other self came out.

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,284
You kept insisting that
it was Park Wonseok

71
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,744
who pushed me from the roof.

72
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,287
It was Park Wonseok, you said.

73
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,750
So yeah, I killed Park Wonseok.

74
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,503
You're the one who made me do it.

75
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,546
That's why I helped you
sweep things under the rug.

76
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,509
I wouldn't have killed him
if it hadn't been for you, you bastard!

77
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,386
(breathes shakily)

78
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,929
I'm warning you.

79
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,056
Cut the bullshit.

80
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,350
(sobbing)

81
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,894
You just wanted to hide the fact
that you pushed me off the roof!

82
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,020
Right?

83
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,064
That's why you tried to frame it
on Park Wonseok.

84
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,691
Stop making up excuses.

85
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,234
No matter what you say,

86
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,862
you're still a murderer.

87
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,948
(groans)

88
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,324
Bring it on!

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,539
(both grunt)

90
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,374
Motherfucker!

91
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,794
(both groan)

92
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,966
You!

93
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,928

94
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,683

Hey, Sooheon!

114
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
Oh, my god! What's up with your forehead?

115
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,919
Hey, what happened to you?

116
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,504
(breathes deeply)

117
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,886
Let me get the first aid kit.

118
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,639
It was Seok Jaebum.

119
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,353
(gasps)

120
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,439
Seok Jaebum

121
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,150
had Park Wonseok's cell phone.

122
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,112
(gasps)

123
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,743

Seok Jaebum is the culprit.

TEACHER: The main themes in Kafka's
"Metamorphosis"

129
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,461
are the loss of humanity and alienation.

130
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:46,382
Originally, Gregory was a hard worker
who took care of his family.

131
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,428
One day, he woke up as a huge cockroach.

132
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:54,182
Through this novel, the author suggests
a new model for a family structure.

133
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,685
(sighs)

134
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,564
I guess Seok Jaebum
didn't come to class today.

135
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,859
Of course not. How could he show his face
at school when you caught him last night?

136
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,986
What are you going to do now?

137
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,990
I guess I'll go to the police.

138
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,827
We have to tell the cops that Seok Jaebum
had my brother's cell phone.

139
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,579
Also...

140
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,457
we have to clear up the fact
that Gi Osung isn't the murderer,

141
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,876
since that's what we've been
telling them up until now.

142
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,880
Who do you think

143
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,673
beat me up last night?

144
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,343
That means there might have been
an accomplice.

145
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,887
Let's tell the police about that too.

146
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,932

So, are you saying Seok Jaebum

157
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,217
had Park Wonseok's phone
you told me about before?

158
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,510
Yes.

159
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,223
So you followed him to the horse track
without him knowing

160
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,936
and saw Seok Jaebum pulling out
Park Wonseok's cell phone?

161
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,229
Yes, that's right.

162
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,023
I know this must be frustrating,
but we can't be certain

163
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,858
that the cell phone he had
was Park Wonseok's.

164
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,360
I mean...

165
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,238
Isn't it obvious if he went straight
to the horse track to find the phone

166
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,950
after we sent him that photo?

167
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,744
If we had tried to pull off something like
what you did yesterday,

168
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,079
we would've called that a sting operation.

169
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,207
It can't be constituted as evidence.

170
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,667
(sighs)

171
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,043
Please arrest Seok Jaebum.

172
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,004
You have to investigate
this properly this time.

173
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,463
(breathes deeply)

174
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,841
Seok Jaebum

175
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,594
was reported missing this morning.

176
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,933
His car was found on a riverbed
near the horse track.

177
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,769
The cops are currently looking for him.

178

179
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,025
Sooheon,

180
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,778
I need to ask you a few questions
in the interrogation room.

181
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,697
Shall we?

182
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,950
Here.

183
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,411
(exhales deeply)

184
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,121
What you're saying is that the person

185
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,999
who hit your head
must be the accomplice, right?

186
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,876
I guess what I mean
is that there's a good chance

187
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,960
they might have been an accomplice.

188
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,046
You didn't hurt your head
while fighting Seok Jaebum?

189
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,088
No.

190
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,214
I lost consciousness when that person
came out of nowhere

191
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,591
and hit me over the head.

192
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,550
(inhales deeply)

193
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,887
You said you didn't see anyone else there
when you woke up.

194
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,431
Do you remember what time that was?

195
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,808
Uh, I didn't check the time.

196
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,977
Then what time was it
when you got back home?

197
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,897
(sighs)
Ah, I don't know.

198
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,565
Chanmi should know though.

199
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,900
(sighs)

200
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:56,113
Well, this isn't a good situation
for you, Sooheon,

201
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,117
now that Seok Jaebum has gone missing.

202
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,372
(indistinct chatter)

203
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,251
What do you think happened to Seok Jaebum?

204
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,088
How could he have gone missing...

205
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,006
He's not missing.
He probably just ran away.

206
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,966
Are you saying
that he faked his disappearance

207
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,176
by abandoning his car at the river bed?

208
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,803
He could do worse.

209
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,971
What a piece of shit.

210
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,391
After I learned that he was the murderer,

211
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,019
my hands and feet started shaking.
It gives me goosebumps.

212
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,773
(whimpering)
Then why was he so nice to me like that?

213
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,067
I had always felt very grateful
to him too.

214
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,446
(sighs)

215
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,702
I want to confront him directly
and ask him why he killed my brother.

216
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,204
There is no such thing as a legitimate

217
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,206
or understandable reason
for killing someone.

218
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,418
It's only going to be hurtful for you
to hear what he says.

219
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,294
Don't even think
about seeing Seok Jaebum again.

220
00:11:55,965 --> 00:12:00,344
(indistinct chatter)

221
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,470
(camera shutter clicks)

222
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,265
(sighs)

223
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,683
Did you find anything?

224
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,059
Ah, yes.

225
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,396
I found two bloodstains on the ground,
so I took some samples.

226
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,106
Nothing worth reporting at the moment.

227
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,315
I see.

228
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,653
So, Seok Jaebum's family
owns this horse track?

229
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,946
It's right by the employee training center
of the Seungpil group,

230
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,406
which Seok Jaebum's family also owns.

231
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,369
Seok Jaebum didn't have any relation
to Park Wonseok's case, did he?

232
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,289
No, the first time he got involved
in the case was during

233
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,665
the live stream incident
at Sa Junggyeong's RV.

234
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,333
He was the one who appeared
wearing a mask instead of Ji Sooheon.

235
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,627
So at that point
when he appeared on the live stream,

236
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,047
it's safe to assume he was
on Ok Chanmi or Ji Sooheon's side, right?

237
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,382
I guess so.

238
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,427
And now that Ji Sooheon and Ok Chanmi
have pinned him down

239
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,137
as Park Wonseok's murderer,

240
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,264
he's become their enemy.

241
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,352
(sighs)

242
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,857
Those two are always
one step ahead of us cops.

243
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,819
(sighs)

244
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,824
JONGGUK: Detective.

245
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,951
We just got the surveillance footage
from the park on the night

246
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,578
that the suspect called Ok Chanmi.

247
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,330
Really?

248
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,168
Let's have a look.

249
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,878
(sighs lightly)

250
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,006
Isn't that Gi Osung and Seok Jaebum?

251
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,009
Yes, those two were
at the park that night.

252
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,011
Were they?

253
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,429
Okay, that's good to know.

254
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,764
Let's go.

255
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,780
It was like this
when we found it this morning.

256
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:49,662
The door was probably left open either
because there was an urgent situation,

257
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,916
or as a poor attempt to trick us
into believing he's gone missing, right?

258
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,417
It's probably one of the two, right?

259
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,585
Whichever one it is,

260
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,672
this means that Seok Jaebum
is somehow related to this case.

261
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,090
We need to find him.

262
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,265
(breathes deeply)

263
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,269
Detective, something's fishy.

264
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,353
What?

265
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,318
This.

266
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,195
Doesn't something
about this seem familiar?

267
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,574
(suspenseful music)

268
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,019
Ajung, come eat.

269
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,105
Yes, ma'am.

270
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,691
I'm just going to stock the items
that just came in.

271
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,065
(breathes seriously)

272
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,859
These two definitely seem similar.

273
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,235
Whether it's the shape of the face
or the body,

274
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,654
there's definitely a resemblance.

275
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,571
(Sojung sighs)

276
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,782
To me, they seem like the same person.

277
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,785
Let's hand this over
to Video Analysis team.

278
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,161
Okay.

279
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,165
(sighs)

280
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,250
(light music)

281
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,103
(ominous music)

282
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,545
Thank you for coming.

283
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,922
I couldn't very well not show up.

284
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,048
Especially since you mentioned
you wanted to apologize

285
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,550
for accusing me of being the murderer.

286
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,552
I'm so sorry.

287
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,887
It was all a misunderstanding.

288
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,223
-I apologize.
-(sighs)

289
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,516
Honestly,

290
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,852
it was kind of hard for me.

291
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,937
Put yourself in my shoes.

292
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,064
It's infuriating to be called a murderer

293
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,608
when you're not a murderer.

294
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,945
"I'm sorry."

295
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,323
I don't know that I can forgive you
with just those two words.

296
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,658
I'm truly sorry.

297
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,909
I will apologize to you again.

298
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,872
An apology only counts when the victim
agrees to accept it as one.

299
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,915
(breathes heavily)

300
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,003
You haven't yet told me
the most important thing.

301
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,129
So...

302
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,424
who was Park Wonseok's murderer?

303
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,136
You already know who.

304
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,848
-What?
-You already know, don't you?

305
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,017
-How would I know?
-(sighs)

306
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,479
You were at the horse track last night.

307
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,155
So, Ji Sooheon saw me there last night?

308
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,618
I assumed he wouldn't have seen me.

309
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,161
So it was you.

310
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,831
You were the one
who attacked Ji Sooheon from behind.

311
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,832
He was knocked out immediately

312
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,125
when I hit him
over the head with a shovel.

313
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,503
(exhales deeply)
It was a pretty good hit.

314
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,296
(laughs)

315
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,006
I'll never forget
how satisfying that felt.

316
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,383
I'm going to ask you politely.

317
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,344
So...

318
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,262
where's Seok Jaebum now?

319
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,556
I heard his family reported him
as missing.

320
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,141
How would I know where he is
when even the police can't find him?

321
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,894
-Where is Seok Jaebum right now?
-I said I didn't know, shit.

322
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,145
(sighs)

323
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,313
Why don't you just drop it?

324
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,357
You're the accomplice, aren't you?

325
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,483
This bitch...

326
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,902
You and Seok Jaebum killed
my older brother together, didn't you?

327
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,529
(sighs deeply)

328
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,405
Fuck, here she goes again
with this nonsense.

329
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,201
I knew there was something off about you
telling me you wanted to apologize.

330
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,246
(soft chuckles)
You're annoying as shit.

331
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,248
If you're not the accomplice,
you can just tell me.

332
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,376
Where's Seok Jaebum right now?

333
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,836
This crazy bitch.

334
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,420
Enough with that bullshit.

335
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,797
(sighs)

336
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,715
Hold on a second.

337
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,844
Let me stop recording.

338
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,390
(scoffs)

339
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,018
Let me just make a call real quick.

340
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,104
One second.

341
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,188
DETECTIVE JIN SOJUNG

342
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,817
SOJUNG (on cell phone): <i>Hello?</i>

343
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,906
Hi Detective Jin. It's Ok Chanmi.

344
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,577
It seems Gi Osung
went to the horse track last night,

345
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,747
and he was the one who hit Ji Sooheon
over the head to knock him out.

346
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,792
Please summon him to the station
and find Seok Jaebum's whereabouts.

347
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,003
-(sighs deeply)
-Yes.

348
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,546
I'm sending you the recording now.

349
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,299
(sighs)

350
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,179
Ok Chanmi.

351
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,974
I'm going to make sure
you die at my hands someday.

352
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,228
I'll make you crawl on all fours
like an animal and squeal for forgiveness.

353
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,816
I'll hold off on getting my apology
from you until then.

354
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,037
(sighs)

355
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,759
I'm telling you the truth.

356
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,555
How would I know where he is
when he's been reported as missing?

357
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,891
Maybe he hasn't disappeared.

358
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,768
Maybe he just ran away.

359
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,269
Seok Jaebum

360
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,147
killed Park Wonseok.

361
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,482
What?

362
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,901
Jaebum is the murderer?

363
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,277
I'm positive.

364
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:44,034
Seok Jaebum tried to protect Park Wonseok.
Why would he kill him?

365
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,245
Are you sure
there wasn't some sort of mistake?

366
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,747
I'm sure it was Seok Jaebum.

367
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,375
Jihyun.

368
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,545
Either he went missing or is in hiding,
we have to find him as soon as possible.

369
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,839
That's the only way we can prevent
more casualties from happening.

370
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,133
What can I possibly do to help?

371
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,760
(sighs)

372
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,559
What's this?

373
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,019
A GPS tracker.

374
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,607
Put this in Gi Osung's backpack secretly.

375
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,489
Gi Osung's probably going to head over
to where Seok Jaebum is.

376
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,575
-We need to get him to confess.
-(sighs)

377
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,577
We need to stop this
before the situation gets any worse.

378
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,162
(sighs)

379
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,455
Jihyun.

380
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,884
Thank you so much.

381
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,429
(sighs)

382
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,351
SOJUNG: Why were you at the horse track?

383
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,855
OSUNG: To meet with Seok Jaebum.

384
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,107
I just went there to hang out with him.
Anything wrong with that?

385
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,114
Was that right after you received
this photo of Park Wonseok's phone?

386
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,240
No.

387
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,867
That photo is a joke.

388
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,329
It could have been anyone's phone,
so I didn't pay much attention to it.

389
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,749
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

390
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,375
Then you must know where this is, right?

391
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,003
The park where you like
to play basketball.

392
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,758
The prime suspect in the Park Wonseok case

393
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:27,387
called Ok Chanmi
with Park Wonseok's cell phone

394
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,932
from this park that same night.

395
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:36,730
At the time, you and Seok Jaebum
were at this park.

396
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,196
Park Wonseok's cell phone
was hidden at the race track.

397
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,075
And fearing that someone
had discovered this phone,

398
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,951
you and Seok Jaebum rushed to the track.

399
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,288
Ji Sooheon, who was chasing
after the evidence, went to the track

400
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,749
and was hit over the head
with a shovel by you, Gi Osung,

401
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,125
then lost consciousness.

402
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,169
The next morning,

403
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,047
Seok Jaebum's car was found
by the river bed,

404
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,174
and he was reported missing.

405
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,342
(sighs deeply)

406
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,968
Wow, that's quite a story you made up.

407
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,640
I have no idea what you're talking about.

408
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,851
Okay then.
(inhales deeply)

409
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:19,481
If you choose to keep denying everything,
it won't be good for you in court.

410
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,234
In court?

411
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,487
CHANMI: <i>At this point, Gi Osung</i>

412
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,198
is probably pissed that he's being
investigated by the police.

413
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,451
Blinded by rage,

414
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,830
Gi Osung will probably head over
to Seok Jaebum's hideout.

415
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:39,126
We need to catch Seok Jaebum
before the police do.

416
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,710
(sighs deeply)

417
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,257
By the way, do you really think
Kook Jihyun will help us out

418
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,008
by planting the GPS tracker for us?

419
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,970
I know she will.

420
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,555
But still,

421
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,181
they're siblings.

422
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,894
(sighs lightly)

423
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,188
(light music)

424
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,366
(knocking)

425
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,591
(breathes deeply)

426
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,273
-What are you doing in my room?
-Where did you store my photos?

427
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,652
I have them on my phone, nowhere else.
And you know dad already took it away.

428
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,445
Don't you have an external hard drive
or something like that?

429
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,405
No, I'm telling the truth.

430
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,458
(sighs deeply)

431
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,128
Hey, Sooheon, Chanmi.

432
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,631
Hey, you shouldn't run.
You have to look out for your baby.

433
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,882
It's fine.

434
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,509
By the way, that crazy bitch...

435
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,393
Have you heard anything
from that crazy girl, Soyeon?

436
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,519
Nothing yet.

437
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,147
She really must have gone crazy,
hasn't she? What happened to her?

438
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,025
-She just disappeared out of nowhere.
-When I catch that bitch Soyeon,

439
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,903
I'm going to pull out all her hair.

440
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,154
Crazy bitch...

441
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,703
(sighs)

442
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,040
Uh, hey!

443
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,417
Hey, Sooheon.

444
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,876
Hey, what's up?

445
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,023
EP1. BASE MAKEUP

446
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,649
HONG AJUNG
WHERE ARE YOU?

447
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,942
(gasps)

448
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,319
Crazy bitch.

449
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,029
HONG AJUNG
WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU?

450
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,032
VIDEO CALL FROM HONG AJUNG

451
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,534
(light music)

452
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,249
<i>Hey, Soyeon! What's with that uniform?</i>

453
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,877
<i>You're driving me crazy.
Are you working a part-time job somewhere?</i>

454
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,837
I need to earn a living, don't I?

455
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,797
<i>Screw that, where are you?</i>

456
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,299
None of your business.

457
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,634
How have you been?

458
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,677
Oh, Chanmi!

459
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,845
Wow.

460
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,764
Well, I'm just relieved
to know you're alive.

461
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,390
Hey, hey, did anyone else die?

462
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,516
<i>Seok Jaebum.</i>

463
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,685
<i>He went missing,
and things have been crazy over here.</i>

464
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,854
Seok Jaebum went missing? How?

465
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,439
-<i>I don't know.</i>
-(Chanmi sighs)

466
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,026
<i>Words on the street
is that he killed Park Wonseok.</i>

467
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,361
What? Seok Jaebum?

468
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,988
Are you telling me Seok Jaebum
is the culprit?

469
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,114
MAN 1: Don't you think we killed it today?

470
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,199
MAN 2: Yeah, 3 goals and all.

471
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,867
-MAN 3: Hey all three goals were...
-Hey, I'm hanging up now.

472
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,786
Don't tell anyone we video-chatted.

473
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,163
MAN 2: Hey, there's a reason
why I'm earning so much.

474
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,416
MAN 3: Come on, once you earn that much,
you just retire and...

475
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,257
(chomps)

476
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,513
(suspenseful music)

477
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,270
AJUNG: <i>He went missing,
and things have been crazy over here.</i>

478
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,899
<i>Words on the street
is that he killed Park Wonseok.</i>

479
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,035
(suspenseful music)

480
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,423
(exhales deeply)

481
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,274
(sighs)

482
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,779
(inhales deeply)

483
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,947
SOOHEON: Gi Osung

484
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,908
hasn't budged since he got home.

485
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,536
(sighs deeply)

486
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,457
When I saw your email
asking for that video

487
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,167
of Wonseok falling from the science lab,

488
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,044
I felt like a coward
for running away to the US.

489
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,923
Especially since this isn't over yet.

490
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,802
Seok Jaebum was the murderer.

491
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,682
Hold on.

492
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,685
It was Seok Jaebum and not Gi Osung?

493
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,728
Yeah.

494
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:35,982
I really want to ask Seok Jaebum
why he did it, but he's currently missing.

495
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,025
(sighs)

496
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,860
He literally disappeared.

497
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,698
(shaking)

498
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,826
(voice shaking)
Actually, I...

499
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,915
was dating Wonseok.

500
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,337
(breathes deeply)

501
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,049
When Wonseok and I
were in the science lab,

502
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,676
we were unknowingly photographed.

503
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,473
(Sejin laughs)

504
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,099
(indistinct chatter)

505
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,935
WONSEOK: It's going to be nice.

506
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,228
SEJIN: Ah, I'm so happy.

507
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,354
(smiles)

508
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,688
(laughs)

509
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,866
(light music)

510
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:43,049
Gi Osung used that video against Wonseok
and that was when he started bullying him.

511
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,262
He toyed with Wonseok
and made him do bad things.

512
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,805
(gasps)

513
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,558
Gi Osung didn't even have
to get his hands dirty.

514
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,771
He made Wonseok
do all kinds of dirty work for him.

515
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,482
(sobbing)

516
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,693
That's why the other students
didn't like Wonseok.

517
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,070
Seok Jaebum was the one

518
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,240
who tried to protect Wonseok
from Gi Osung.

519
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,577
I don't know what happened...

520
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,997
I'll uncover the truth.

521
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,882
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

522
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,137
JONGGUK: Huh?

523
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,181
Detective Jin,
it was actually Seok Jaebum.

524
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,350
Seok Jaebum.

525
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,145
-Get a warrant for him right away.
-JONGGUK: Yes, ma'am.

526
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,356
(sighs)

527
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,152
(ominous music)

528
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,345
(ominous music continues)

529
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,309
(door rattles)

530
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,521
-Where are you going this late at night?
-Huh?

531
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,482
Uh...

532
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,275
To see Ajung.

533
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,986
Ajung asked me to come visit her
since she's feeling lonely.

534
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,905
It's about the baby.

535
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,657
Oh, yeah?

536
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,741
Yeah, I'm going to head out now.

537
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,244
Take this.

538
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,081
I'll have this on my way over there,
thanks.

539
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,124
Hey, I'm running late,
so I'm going to head out.

540
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,084
(grunts)

541
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,478
(boat horn honks)

542
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,545
Chanmi.

543
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,218
Why did you kill him?

544
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,847
Why did you kill my brother?

545
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,520
-Chanmi.
-Stay right there!

546
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,771
Don't come near me.

547
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,732
Ok Chanmi!

548
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,400
I'm going to shoot
if you try anything stupid.

549
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,193
(breathes deeply)

550
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,362
(both breathe deeply)

551
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,905
It's over now.

552
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,490
Tell me everything!

553
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,368
(sobbing)
Why did you kill him?

554
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,954
How did you kill him? Hurry up and answer!

555
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,624
(breathes deeply)

556
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,802
WONSEOK:
Don't you have a match today or something?

557
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,262
Watch it!

558
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,223
You can't disrespect me like that.
I'm older than you.

559
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,225
How about you win a gold medal this time

560
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,561
so you can hang it around
your older brother's neck?

561
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,771
I mean, of course.

562
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,231
Nothing will ever change the fact
that I'm your older brother.

563
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,027
(Wonseok grunts)

564
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,321
Tomorrow I start winter vacation,
so I'll come down to Busan on Sunday.

565
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,198
I have something I need to tell you.

566
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,699
Uh...

567
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,159
I'll tell you when we meet.

568
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,078
-Oh...
-(door closes)

569
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,253
Hey, hold on a second.

570
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,470
Jaebum, were you released
from the hospital?

571
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,556
Are you feeling better now?

572
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,725
Ah, I'm so confused.
What's going on with you all of a sudden?

573
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,188
I'll get you back

574
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,941
for what you did to me.

575
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,317
Huh?

576
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,862
Get me back? What do you mean...

577
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:15,988
(Wonseok groans)

578
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,535
(ominous music)

579
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,888
OK CHANMI

580
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,731
Have you been lying to me
since the day we met?

581
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,276
How could you bring yourself
to act all nice to me

582
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,652
and feign a kind expression
after you killed my brother?

583
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,862
No!

584
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,156
I didn't mean to! I didn't know.

585
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,116
I didn't realize what I had done.

586
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,410
I honestly didn't even remember

587
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,745
that I had pushed Park Wonseok
out the window.

588
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,166
It was only a few days ago
that I remembered everything again.

589
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,627
I remembered that it was all because
of the other person living inside of me.

590
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,464
I only remembered that I called you
from Park Wonseok's cell phone

591
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,966
just a few days ago.

592
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,302
I'm telling you the truth.

593
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,320
CALL
OK CHANMI

594
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,657
CHANMI (on cell phone): <i>Hello?</i>

595
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,742
(Chanmi pants)

596
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,993
<i>Who are you?</i>

597
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,495
<i>-Why do you have Wonseok's cell phone?</i>
-(cell phone beeps)

598
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,039
(panting)
<i>Hello?</i>

599
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,415
OK CHANMI

600
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,500
(cell phone beeps)

601
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,712
(foreboding music)

602
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,594
(breathes deeply)

603
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,429
So I heard that ringtone

604
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,390
because Gi Osung's cellphone
rang inside his bag?

605
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,978
That's why I incorrectly assumed
Gi Osung was the culprit.

606
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,355
(sighs)
When you were the real murderer.

607
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,522
(breathes heavily)

608
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,733
Seok Jaebum.

609
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,362
Even if you have another person
inside of you, that's no excuse.

610
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,405
You're right.

611
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,912
-Chanmi, can you just kill me?
-Don't move!

612
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,833
-Give me the gun.
-I said don't move!

613
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,418
(sobbing)

614
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,546
(panting)

615
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,006
(retching)

616
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,301
(gasping)

617
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,386
(breathes heavily)

618
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,517
(groans roughly)

619
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,524
(gasps)

620
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,026
(groans)

621
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,195
(grunting)

622
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,657
(breathes heavily)

623
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,741
(groans)

624
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,538
(gasping)

625
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,293
(grunts, groans)

626
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,714
(breathes heavily)

627
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,091
(groans)

628
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,968
-(Jeabum grunts)
-(groaning)

629
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,512
(panting)

630
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,055
(breathes heavily)

631
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,223
(grunts)

632
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,037
(gasps)

633
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,998
Seok Jaebum.

634
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,083
No.

635
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,418
You're Seok Jaejun, aren't you?

636
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,919
(shaking)
Seok Jaejun...

637
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,463
Stop saying my name.

638
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,048
How dare you call me by my name

639
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,299
when you don't even know
anything about me?

640
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,508
Seok Jaejun.

641
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,011
Why do you act like you're a living person
when you're actually dead?

642
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,264
Why did you enter Seok Jaebum's body
and do all these evil things?

643
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,432
(breathes deeply)

644
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,642
-Shut up!
-(gasps)

645
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,728
You don't think I'll kill you?

646
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,314
(panting)

647
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,566
(sobbing)
Please set Seok Jaebum free.

648
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,692
(scoffs)

649
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,695
We're the same person.

650
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,156
I'm Seok Jaebum,

651
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,533
and Seok Jaebum is me.

652
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,826
No.

653
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,747
Seok Jaebum isn't a demon like you are.

654
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,123
A demon?

655
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,584
(scoffs)

656
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,211
Yeah, I'm a demon.

657
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,130
Why do you think I've become a demon?

658
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,216
(shouts)
Who do you think made me this way?

659
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,802
(breathes shakily)

660
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,720
(breathes rapidly)

661
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,520
You.

662
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,314
What are you doing in my room?

663
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,774
Who are you going to see the game with?

664
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,067
(sighs)

665
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,444
I asked you who you're going to go with.

666
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,364
Ji Sooheon.

667
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,200
I'm late. I have to go.

668
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,624
Fine, I'll get lost.

669
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,507
Jaebum, try and consider my feelings too.

670
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,436
What's this?

671
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,317
ADMISSION STUDY CAFÉ
ENTRANCE RECEIPT

672
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,735
(sighs)

673
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,873
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The number
you have dialed is unavailable...</i>

674
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,375
JI SOOHEON

675
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,466
GOGO STADIUM

676
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,968
JAEJUN: <i>Because Ji Sooheon
wasn't answering his phone</i>

677
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,845
<i>and seemed to be ditching him
for someone else,</i>

678
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,098
<i>Seok Jaebum got mad.</i>

679
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,104
(ominous music)

680
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,320
Sooheon!

681
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,990
Taxi!

682
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,453
<i>On that night...</i>

683
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,914
Seok Jaebum
shouldn't have followed Ji Sooheon.

684
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,791
It was Seok Jaebum's fault. Do you get it?

685
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,427
(foreboding music)

686
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,560
(Hyeokgeon grunts)

687
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,145

(grunts)

689
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,069
Excuse me.

690
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,531
Are you okay?

691
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,491
(breathes heavily)

692
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:16,867

693
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,286
(breathes heavily)

694
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,081
-I know you.
-(grunts)

695
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,999
You're Seok Jaebum, right?

696
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,210
You went to Chungwoo Middle school.
The billionaire, Seok Jaebum!

697
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,419
It wasn't me that did this to you!

698
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,505
-Did you do this to me?
-I'm telling you, it honestly wasn't me.

699
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,340
-Seok Jaebum, You son of a bitch!
-I didn't do it...

700
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,925
-HYEOKGEON: You're fucking done!
-I didn't do it...

701
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,843
Do you really think you'll get away
with this? Come back here!

702
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,597
-Please, please, it wasn't me.
-(echoes)

703
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,558
-Please! I didn't do it.
-Seok Jaebum! You bastard!

Seok Jaebum, you fucking bastard!

Seok Jaebum, get over here! Fuck, fuck!

707
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,731
I told you I didn't do it, shit!

00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,443
Hey, you son of, son of a bitch...

710
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,487
I told you it wasn't me!
It wasn't me! Shit!

711
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,948
(groans roughly)

712
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,701
Listen to me when I tell you it wasn't me.

713
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,910
-Huh?
-(groaning)

714
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,788
You're pissing me off, shit.

715
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,456
(groans)

716
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,295
(grunting)

717
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,883
(breathes heavily)

718
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,222
(panting)

719
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,599
(exhales deeply)

720
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,934
(gasps)

721
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,021
(breathes heavily)

722
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,275
(ominous music)

723
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,595
JAEJUN: <i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

724
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,513
<i>Ju Hyeokgeon had already seen
Seok Jaebum's face.</i>

725
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,891
Seok Jaebum would never reveal
that Ji Sooheon was the culprit.

726
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,018
So he just made sure
to keep Ju Hyeokgeon's mouth shut.

727
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,311
(inhales deeply)

728
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,229
I did it because of Seok Jaebum.

729
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,232
We're one.

730
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,318
It was Seok Jaebum's fault.

731
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,070
Park Wonseok and Ju Hyeokgeon...

732
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,406
Seok Jaebum and I
killed both of them together.

733
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,033
Stop making up excuses like a coward!

734
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,159
(grunts)

735
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,328
Seok Jaejun,
you were responsible for all of it.

736
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,080
Seok Jaebum is not that kind of person.

737
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,831
Seok Jaebum is a good guy.

738
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,125
(inhales deeply)

739
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,669
I trust Seok Jaebum.

740
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,296
I trust that there's good inside of him.

741
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,424
Are you...

742
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,304
saying you trust Seok Jaebum,

743
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,932
even though we killed your brother?

744
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,023
(sobs)

745
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,025
Please let Seok Jaebum go.

746
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,653
-(scoffs)
-(sobbing)

747
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,698
I'm devastated to have lost my brother.
I feel so empty inside.

748
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,619
But nothing can bring him back.

749
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,954
(sobs)

750
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,164
You're stuck on something
that can't be reversed.

751
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,334
(sobbing)
You left this world a long time ago.

752
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,420
There's nothing you can do
about things that have already happened.

753
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,339
Leave Seok Jaebum's body.

754
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,677
That's the only thing you can do
for your brother.

755
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,596
(breathes shakily)

756
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,349
(breathes heavily)

757
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,893
(groans)

758
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,646
(breathes rapidly)

759
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,275
(breathes heavily)

760
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,153
(sighs deeply)

761
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,200
(sighs)

762
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,789
(exhales deeply)

763
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,722
(gasps)

764
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,640
(grunts)

765
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,725
(gunshot)

766
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,727
(grunting)

767
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,936
(breathes roughly)

768
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,525
(sobbing)

769
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,403
(breathes deeply)

770
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,618
(exhales deeply)

771
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,550
(grunts)

772
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,763
(somber music)

773
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,602
(sobbing)

774
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,865
(breathes deeply)

775
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,169
Chanmi.

776
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,255
I'm sorry.

777
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,383
(inhales deeply)
The police couldn't do anything for you.

778
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,301
It's fine.

779
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,930
Get in.

780
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,106
(theme music)

781
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,288
(sobbing)

782
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,971
OK CHANMI

783
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,517
CHANMI: <i>I found Seok Jaebum.
He confessed everything.</i>

784
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,062
<i>Detective Jin Sojung took him with her.</i>

785
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,897
<i>Don't worry, I'll be on my way.</i>

786
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,398
(sighs deeply)

787
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,072
-Uh!
-What's up?

788
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,698
Ugh, looks like we're not going to
have study hall instead of PE today.

789
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,450
Class 3 and 4 will be together.
Let's go play basketball.

790
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,202
Change into your gym clothes, quick.

791
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,120
-I'll be there soon.
-Okay.

792
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,043
CHANMI: <i>I have something to discuss
with you about Gi Osung.</i>

793
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,379
<i>Come to the rooftop. Now.</i>

794
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,260
(grunts)

795
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,471
RESTRICTED AREA
DO NOT ENTER

796
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,100
(breathes lightly)

797
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,309
(grunts)

798
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,784
(ominous music)

799
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,418
(breathes seriously)

800
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,551
(gasps)

801
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,263
What are you doing?

802
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,974
How dare you use a tracker to find me?

803
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,645
-(breathes heavily)
-And you. How could you betray me?

804
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,896
(breathes in fear)

805
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,107
Kook Jihyun didn't do anything wrong.
Let her go.

806
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,694
I forced her to do it. I'm sorry.

807
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,155
-Please, let her go.
-(sighs)

808
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:37,200
Kook Jihyun, I'll take care of you
after I'm finished with Ji Sooheon.

809
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,702
(sighs)

810
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,537
-Wait here.
-(sobbing)

811
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,164
Kneel.

812
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,292
I told you to kneel! You fucker!

813
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,209
Okay.

814
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,544
I'll kneel.

815
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,634
You owe me an apology.

816
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,094
(breathes seriously)

817
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,764
Bow your head!

818
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,975
(shouts)
Bow your head!

819
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,852
(shaking)

820
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,145
I'm sorry.

821
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,189
Please let her go.

822
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,940

823
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,735

(groans)

827
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:18,909
How's this, eh?

828
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,453
How do you fucking like that?
You fucking son of a bitch!

829
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,247

Son of a bitch!

I guess we should run over there.

(both grunt)

847
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,377

-Ji Sooheon?
-Was it Ji Sooheon?

866
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,341
It couldn't be. He's such a nice guy.

867

-Isn't that Ji Sooheon?
-It's him.

868

Ji, Ji, Ji...

00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,907
(sobbing)

888
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,000
JATAEK: Stop standing around,
and go back to your classroom.

889
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:14,960
Go back now!

890
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,461
DEOKHYEON: Go back to your classrooms now!

891
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,838
Stop taking pictures.
Go back to your classrooms now!

892
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,507
Go back now!

893
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,050
It was Ji Sooheon on the roof, right?

894
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,426
Did Ji Sooheon push him?

895
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,428
Does that mean Ji Sooheon
will get arrested?

896
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,066
STUDENT 1:
Why else would he have been up there?

897
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,651
What other reason would there be?

898
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,403
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

899
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,696
Did you get the message?

900
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,155
It's spreading quickly.

901
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,156
-NAKJUN: What message?
-STUDENT 2: What? What is it?

902
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,491
-STUDENT 3: Here.
-NAKJUN: I just got it. I got it too.

903
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,575
-STUDENT 3: Oh, yeah, me too.
-SEUNGWOO: What's this?

904
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,453
NAKJUN:
Please forward this to people around you.

905
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,914
SEONHA: <i>Please forward this
to people around you.</i>

906
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:53,915
What's this? Amazing!

907
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,041
SEONHA: <i>I'm Min Seonha,</i>

908
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,879
<i>Ji Sooheon was the hero
who punished that rapist Sa Junggyeong.</i>

909
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,090
<i>Please root for Ji Sooheon.</i>

910
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,718
-Oh, my god! Was Ji Sooheon the hero?
-Dang!

911
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,052
-Ji Sooheon?
-(gasps)

912
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,095
Amazing.

913
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,806
Then why were Gi Osung and Ji Sooheon
fighting each other on the rooftop?

914
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,058
Maybe that wasn't a fight.
Maybe it was punishment?

915
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,351
Oh, that sounds right.
That sounds about right.

916
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,602
-Wow, Ji Sooheon.
-He was punishing him.

917
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,522
-Wow, he's so cool.
-That was punishment.

918
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,816
He's a total hero, right?

919
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,234
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

920
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,696
Apparently, Gi Osung threatened
Kook Jihyun with a knife on the rooftop.

921
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,031
-Huh?
-What?

922
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,574
Aren't they siblings?

923
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,575
(sighs)

924
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,660
-Where's the decency?
-It's unbelievable.

925
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,579
I just got goosebumps.

926
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,706
-Gi Osung's the ultimate villain.
-(gasps)

927
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,833
I heard the only reason Park Wonseok
did all that shit was

928
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,252
because Gi Osung was blackmailing him.

929
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,170
-(gasps)
-Seriously?

930
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,713
That’s ridiculous, seriously.

931
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:42,797
I remember Gi Osung
treating him like trash.

932
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,965
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

933
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,967
The police
have arrested Park Wonseok's murderer.

934
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,677
-The culprit was Seok Jaebum.
-Seok Jaebum?

935
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,720
-Yeah.
-What?

936
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,972
-Why would he do that?
-Did Seok Jaebum do that?

937
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,058
You know, when Seok Jaebum
lost his memory, Gi Osung gaslighted him,

938
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,393
and that's why he killed Park Wonseok.

939
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,228
So Gi Osung killed him, basically.

940
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,022
-Ugh, how cruel.
-Wow, is he out of his mind?

941
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,441
I also heard Gi Osung
had pushed Seok Jaebum off the rooftop

942
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,777
to kill him, and that was
how Seok Jaebum lost his memory.

943
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,111
-Really?
-Yeah.

944
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,365
Wow, seriously?
Gi Osung's a real piece of shit.

945
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,325
Yeah, he's a real psychopath. Huh?

946
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,369
He deserved it then. He deserved it.

947
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,371
-(sighs)
-I knew that's the kind of person he was.

948
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,288
I agree.

949
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,124
DO NOT ENTER-POLICE LINE-
UNDER INVESTIGATION

950
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,182
(both sigh)

951
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,559
(sighs)

952
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,686
(inhales deeply)

953
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,357
(sighs)

954
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,025
Let's go.

955
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,501
Was Gi Osung fighting
with anyone on the rooftop?

956
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,756
No, I don't think so.

957
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,051
It looked like he jumped by himself.

958
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,678
Was there anyone else there?

959
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,639
I didn't see anyone
but Gi Osung on the rooftop.

960
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,599
Gi Osung was the only one there.

961
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,851
He was alone up there?

962
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,520
I could see only Gi Osung up there.

963
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:25,733
Yeah, I think Kook Jihyun
was the only other person there.

964
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,861
Right, I think Gi Osung
was the only one there.

965
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,614
It seemed like Gi Osung was fighting
with someone up on the rooftop.

966
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,657
-No, he wasn't.
-No, he wasn't.

967
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,616
-No, he wasn't.
-I have no idea.

968
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,742
-I don't know.
-No idea.

969
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,994
-I didn't see it.
-He was alone up there.

970
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,120
I didn't see it.

971
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,746
I didn't see anyone else up there.

972
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,040
-You were close to Gi Osung, right?
-Yes.

973
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,668
Do you know
who Gi Osung went to see on the rooftop?

974
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,794
I'm not sure.

975
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,713
I didn't see anyone else
but Osung up there.

976
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,424
Yeah, it was just Osung.

977
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,634
Ah...

978
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,219
Is that so?

979
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,597
Um.

980
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,313
Here's something warm to drink.

981
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,617
Gi Osung suddenly lost his temper
and told me he was going to kill me.

982
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,537
Then he

983
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:22,999
jumped from the rooftop.

984
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,045
So he wasn't fighting anyone?

985
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,634
There was...

986
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,262
no one else up there.

987
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,394
(ominous music)

988
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,610
So far, it doesn't seem
like it was a murder.

989
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,118
If everyone decides
to corroborate a lie...

990
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,161
(light sigh)

991
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,122
...then it becomes the truth.

992
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,253
(sighs)

993
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,235
