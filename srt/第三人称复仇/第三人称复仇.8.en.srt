1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,269
- Really?
- Yeah, your bangs are burnt.

2
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:05,878
- What?
- I was so surprised, really.

3
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:07,797
Seriously, come on.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,465
Oh. Gi Osung?

5
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:10,591
Oh, hey, Osung.

6
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:12,235
Did you come here looking for me again?

7
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:13,302
Yeah.

8
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:15,113
By any chance are you guys
celebrating Ok Chanmi's birthday?

9
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:16,239
I guess you already ran into her?

10
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:17,532
It seemed like she was on her way
to wash her face

11
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:19,475
after getting a cake smash.

12
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:21,453
Why don't you stay and celebrate with us
since you're already here?

13
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:23,104
Yeah, you should join us.

14
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:26,065
It's fine. I wasn't even invited anyway.

15
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,150
Jaebum, I'll wait for you
in the café out front.

16
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:29,610
Okay, then.

17
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,579
FATHER

18
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:42,415
I'm going to head out.

19
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:43,916
See you.

20
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,669
Yes, father.

21
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:53,843
It was Gi Osung?

22
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:57,138
Are you saying it was Gi Osung's ringtone?

23
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:00,516
Yeah, Gi Osung came in after you left.

24
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:02,018
Then I heard his ringtone.

25
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:06,731
It's not a common ringtone.

26
00:01:06,814 --> 00:01:08,482
And he was close to Park Wonseok.

27
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:11,115
That's why I think the person
who called you...

28
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:13,571
was Gi Osung.

29
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:17,575
Gi Osung. I'm going to kill him.

30
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,705
- Don't even think about shooting him.
- Why not?

31
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:24,498
You punished all those bad guys yourself,

32
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:25,976
and now you're telling me
to leave this murderer alone?

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm not saying you shouldn't take action.

34
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:30,355
All I'm saying is that you should think
about how it will impact your life!

35
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,923
I don't care. I'm going to kill them all.

36
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:34,924
Mind your own business!

37
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:38,596
Chanmi.

38
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:39,930
I understand.

39
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:43,601
Let's calm down for now.

40
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:47,688
Promise me you won't pursue this alone.

41
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,777
Promise me.

42
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,862
Don't go after Gi Osung alone.

43
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,450
Fine.

44
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:25,851
Jaebum, why don't you go back home today?

45
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:28,312
Your mother's worried about you.

46
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,483
What's keeping you from going back home?

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,613
You haven't been back since I gave you
that photo of you and Park Wonseok.

48
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:42,451
The photos have nothing to do with it.

49
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:44,703
Really?

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,873
I'm just scared to be home.

51
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,709
What do you mean?

52
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,337
When I'm alone at home,
crazy ideas pop into my head.

53
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:59,854
What I'm trying to say is that
I start having these crazy delusions.

54
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:03,055
I get the feeling
that I did something that I didn't do.

55
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:06,058
And for things that I did do,
I have no memory of them.

56
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:11,814
I think I'm going crazy, seriously.
I'm really scared.

57
00:03:13,357 --> 00:03:14,567
Jaebum?

58
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,569
It's driving me crazy!

59
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:19,989
I can't come out of these crazy delusions.

60
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:21,907
Jaebum.

61
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:23,576
Calm down. Just calm down.

62
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:26,036
Do think you're going crazy right now?

63
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:29,373
You jumped from a building

64
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:32,585
and hurt your head. You lost memories,
and you're just recovering is all.

65
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:34,628
That's why you're feeling so confused.

66
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:40,759
Fuck, how can you be so sure?

67
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:43,429
What?

68
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:47,076
I'm asking you how you can be so sure.

69
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,895
You seem to know everything
that's going on right now.

70
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:52,021
You know what I've done

71
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:54,273
and you know what's going on
inside my head, huh?

72
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,482
Jaebum, I'm... it's not...

73
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:58,378
Are you trying to manipulate me
by showing me a picture of Park Wonseok,

74
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,696
knowing it would embarrass me
that I dated him?

75
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,866
And you're trying to use that against me?

76
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,951
No, damn it,
what are you even talking about?

77
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,620
Why on earth would I manipulate you?

78
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:11,457
You manipulated Park Wonseok too.

79
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,876
That's not the same.

80
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,045
How is that any different, you bastard?

81
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:19,381
What were you going to do
by exploiting my weakness? Huh?

82
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:22,343
Were you going to kill me too
if I didn't listen to you?

83
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:24,386
Damn, you're totally
out of your mind, seriously!

84
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:36,273
Osung.

85
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:38,984
Osung.

86
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:43,447
Was I really in a relationship
with Park Wonseok?

87
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:46,951
Is it true?

88
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,163
Hah, shit!

89
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:13,352
Ajung, are you hungry?
Want to have some dumplings?

90
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:16,595
- Should I go get something for you?
- I'm okay. Don't try so hard to look calm.

91
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:19,400
- I know you're feeling shitty right now.
- Stop giving me shit.

92
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:22,194
Hey.

93
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,489
Did you know Sooheon and Chanmi
were living together?

94
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:28,242
They're not actually living together.

95
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:32,191
- They're just living in the same building.
- I'm asking if you knew that already.

96
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:37,084
I knew.

97
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:39,211
You idiot.

98
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:41,398
You shouldn't have let them live
in the same building!

99
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:43,924
Who am I to tell them not to live
in the same building?

100
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:48,262
Judging by the vibe between those two,

101
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:50,115
it seems like they're already in love
with each other.

102
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:52,349
Hey, shut up.

103
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:56,020
Why are things so messed up?

104
00:05:56,103 --> 00:05:58,522
The wrong person was shot by cupid's arrow

105
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,566
and now Ji Sooheon's a suspect.

106
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,027
But even still...

107
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,904
I think we made the right decision
to celebrate her birthday.

108
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,614
Chanmi seemed happy.

109
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,994
It was my first time seeing her smile.

110
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,045
You didn't have to follow me up here.

111
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,260
Thank you

112
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,596
for today.

113
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:33,557
No problem.

114
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:38,562
About Gi Osung,

115
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:43,150
you're not going to report him
to the police, are you?

116
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:45,319
No.

117
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,506
These are the same cops that didn't
even carry out a proper investigation

118
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,532
and just concluded
that my brother was a suicide.

119
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:51,742
How can I trust them?

120
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:53,911
Also, his father's a police chief.

121
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:56,997
Oh, while we're on the topic,

122
00:06:57,081 --> 00:07:00,167
let's start by confirming

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,531
if the ringtone we heard on that call
is actually the same

124
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:04,230
as the one on Gi Osung's cell phone.

125
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:05,934
How could we be any more certain about it?

126
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,526
How could it possibly be a coincidence
that Gi Osung's ringtone

127
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,094
is the same as the one on that call?

128
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:11,537
That's why we should double check.

129
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:14,723
If we're half-baked about this,
we might not catch the killer.

130
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:16,892
What did you have in mind?

131
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:20,813
If we can match the time
that you heard the ringtone

132
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:23,524
with an incoming call on Gi Osung's phone,

133
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,484
then he's the killer.

134
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,153
There's probably a call log on his phone.

135
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,407
So are you saying we should get a hold
of his phone and unlock it?

136
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,033
That's the hard part.

137
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,971
Right after I transferred to this school,
my cell phone was stolen.

138
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:40,040
Someone hit me over the head with a brick
so that I would lose consciousness

139
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:41,804
and used my fingerprint
to unlock my phone.

140
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:46,755
So are you saying we should hit him
over the head with a brick as well?

141
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,132
Why not?

142
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:51,009
Gosh.

143
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,055
Yeah. Let's give it some more thought.

144
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:58,426
Anyways, rest up for now.
I'm heading back downstairs.

145
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,643
Okay.

146
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:02,980
Ah, I almost forgot!

147
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:04,064
Sorry.

148
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:06,859
I wasn't able to prepare a birthday gift.

149
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:09,236
No worries.

150
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:10,964
There's no way you would've known
it was my birthday.

151
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:12,114
Still...

152
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:15,195
is there anything in particular
you'd like as a gift?

153
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:17,703
I told you it's fine.

154
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:19,705
I mean, but...

155
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:21,248
I still...

156
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,375
would like to...

157
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:25,794
get you something.

158
00:08:28,797 --> 00:08:31,258
In any case, I'll think about it.
Sleep well.

159
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:32,759
Night.

160
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:37,347
Hey, Sooheon.

161
00:08:39,057 --> 00:08:40,184
Then how about...

162
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:43,270
those shoelaces on your tennis shoes.

163
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:48,609
The shoelaces?

164
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:49,693
Yeah.

165
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:51,921
What're you going to do with these?
They're pretty old.

166
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:55,949
Nothing, really. I just thought
it was the finest thing you owned.

167
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,534
Hah, come on!

168
00:08:58,619 --> 00:08:59,661
Are you making fun of me?

169
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:01,538
I own expensive things too.

170
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,624
- No, you don't.
- Right, I don't.

171
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:08,712
You don't have to give them to me.
Who would want used shoelaces?

172
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:09,880
I was just joking.

173
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:11,423
See you tomorrow.

174
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:40,494
Tada.

175
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:42,913
Huh? What's this?

176
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:45,374
What's with these red shoelaces?

177
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,543
Mom, don't you recognize these?

178
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:50,837
Aren't these the shoelaces
from my tennis shoes?

179
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:52,589
That's right.

180
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:54,174
I took them from your shoes.

181
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:57,302
Sooheon.

182
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,974
Why would a boy put red shoelaces
on a pair of white sneakers?

183
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:04,935
Since you can't walk with them on,

184
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,770
I'm going to do the walking for you.

185
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,708
I can't wear your old sneakers
because they're too small for my feet,

186
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:12,776
so I just tied my shoes
with your shoelaces.

187
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,121
I'll walk a lot praying
you'll get better soon.

188
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:26,665
Okay, then.

189
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:30,544
What do you think? Aren't they nice?

190
00:10:58,113 --> 00:11:02,534

This is where we found the receipt.

00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:14,171
YONGTAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

194
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:16,965
This is the receipt.

195
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:19,176
It was left over on the floor
of the body shop.

196
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,970
The torn part of the receipt
was not found at the scene.

197
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:25,366
The reason why I'm emphasizing
the importance of this receipt

198
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,226
is because it's likely
that it belonged to the suspect.

199
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,538
Isn't it possible that it belonged
to one of the customers

200
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:32,814
at the body shop rather than the suspect?

204
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,833
Here, the receipt is there
at the scene of the crime.

205
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:55,295
But here you will see that it wasn't there
before the suspect arrived.

206
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:58,757
Ah, also, it seems this barcode isn't

207
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,386
something you might find
on just another restaurant receipt.

208
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:03,780
Rather, it's a kind of barcode
that certain businesses

209
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,515
might use for their own intents
and purposes.

210
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:08,975
Which leads me to believe
this is part of a membership ID.

211
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,521
Oh, yeah. This barcode is commonly used
in gyms or other places like that.

212
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:13,480
Yes, sir.

213
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:16,358
That's why I'm planning to check
the shopping malls in the area first.

214
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:19,236
That's going to be good evidence.
Make sure you search thoroughly.

215
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:21,321
You haven't made any progress at all!

216
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:38,964
Huh? I was just about to feed Thor.

217
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:40,327
I guess we'll have to watch out.

218
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:42,276
Thor will probably pretend
he hasn't eaten just so he can eat twice.

219
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,261
Wow, you fat cat.

220
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:46,426
Maybe we should decide
who'll feed him on which day.

221
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:58,734
Um?

222
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,823
What? Are you really giving these to me?

223
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:06,658
Didn't you ask for them?

224
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:11,204
Thanks.

225
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,418
Hold on.

226
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:29,806
Did you really have
to change your shoelaces?

227
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,266
Why wouldn't I?

228
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:33,909
What else would I do with shoelaces
other than put them on shoes?

229
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:36,229
It seems like
something's been bothering you.

230
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:40,025
It makes me feel
like you're wearing my clothes.

231
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:41,985
What? It's like that now?

232
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,321
Just don't throw them away.

233
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:48,158
If you feel like throwing them away,
just return them to me.

234
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,428
Do these have
some sort of special meaning for you?

235
00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:51,763
Maybe I shouldn't have asked you
to give them to me.

236
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:54,372
Nah, it's nothing.

237
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:58,126
Anyways, go wherever you want
in those shoes.

238
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,419
Go visit awesome places.

239
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,463
And visit some fun places too.

240
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:02,798
What do you mean?

241
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:05,967
Nakjun!

242
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:07,636
Hey, Sooheon!

243
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,554
Hurry up, dude.

244
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:10,990
I'm surprised you're going to school
on time today.

245
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:12,849
Hey, hey. When was I ever late? Damn.

246
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,601
It's good to see you.

247
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:32,285
Nothing?

248
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,995
Nope, nothing.

249
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,959
All right, let's head
to the next building then.

250
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:37,290
Cheer up.

251
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,727
The way I see this
is that I'm getting paid for working out.

252
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:41,253
- Let's go.
- Okay.

253
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:44,256
It's this one here.

254
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:46,800
Hmm.

255
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,594
On our receipt,
we have the barcode in the center.

256
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:50,971
- You're right.
- Thank you.

257
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:52,055
Of course.

258
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:57,018
Hm, hold on one moment.

259
00:14:57,102 --> 00:15:00,438
I think it actually looks
a lot like our membership pass.

260
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:01,648
Excuse me?

261
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:05,777
Here, if you take a look at this...

262
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:09,281
Ah, this looks the same.

263
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:12,146
Sir, could you please check
when this receipt was issued?

264
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,912
Since only the front part was lost,
most of the information is intact.

265
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:18,331
The torn-off part just has information
about our store.

266
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:20,768
But this back part has all the information
about the date, time,

267
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,520
and, well...
all of that information comes up.

268
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:24,421
Oh, really?
Could you please check it for me?

269
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,107
Yes, sir. Since the torn-off part
is identical on each receipt,

270
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:27,608
I can just fill in the rest
and give it a try, yeah?

271
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:29,509
- Yes, please. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

272
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,892
WITH ME REAL ESTATE

273
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:37,851
Nothing?

274
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:38,934
Nope. Nothing.

275
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:41,354
Wow, did I just set us up for failure?

276
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:43,148
I think you'll be proven right.

277
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:45,042
Why don't we keep going
for a little bit longer?

278
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,943
Oh, I can really count on you, huh?

279
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,863
Cool, let's go!

280
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,166
You can trust me, Sooheon.

281
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,542
I know, I know.

282
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:06,588
I trust that you didn't kill Ju Hyeokgeon,
that bastard.

283
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:11,426
If I hadn't run into him at the OBGYN,
this wouldn't have happened.

284
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,181
I'm not blaming you though, Sooheon.

285
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:19,201
I totally agree that bastards like that
should get their asses kicked.

286
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:20,945
The reason we asked to see you
is because...

287
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:24,940
If the cops were looking for you
while you were gone,

288
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,651
it means they must know something.

289
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:30,028
That's why I thought
we should share what we know,

290
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:31,905
so that we can coordinate our stories.

291
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:33,573
The cops stormed into the gym

292
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:36,326
to find evidence.

293
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:40,664
I had a backpack
where I kept all the tools I used

294
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:42,499
when I smashed those guys.

295
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:44,125
So?

296
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:46,336
Chanmi

297
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:48,922
had snatched the backpack in time.

298
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:52,968
If it weren't for her,
I would've already been arrested.

299
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,594
Had I been caught,

300
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:57,514
I could've been framed as a murderer.

301
00:16:58,515 --> 00:17:00,141
Chanmi is awesome, seriously.

302
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,311
In that case, we should probably
include Chanmi in this

303
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:05,563
so that we can all share information.

304
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:10,068
Anyways, let's just be careful.

305
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:11,152
By the way.

306
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:14,197
Who do you think was responsible
for cutting her brake

307
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,365
and breaking the windows?

308
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,243
Who would've gone into her room
to break her things

309
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:19,869
and rip up her school uniform?

310
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:23,289
Isn't Kook Jihyun pretty eager
to destroy Ok Chanmi these days?

311
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,720
Also, Kook Jihyun has bullies for friends.

312
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,628
You know they beat me up once too.

313
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:32,382
I'm suspicious of Gi Osung.

314
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:33,967
Why would Gi Osung do that to Chanmi?

315
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:37,303
Well, they are siblings after all.

316
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:40,015
If it was Gi Osung who did it,

317
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:41,534
don't you think he would've taken a photo
with his cell phone?

318
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:43,476
If he did it, he probably would've.

319
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,160
So that he could show it to Kook Jihyun.

320
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:46,312
Why don't we...

321
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:49,232
check Gi Osung's phone?

322
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,880
You son of a bitch,
do you have a death wish?

323
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:15,967
Have you lost your mind? Hey!

324
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:18,053
- What?
- Ugh, shit.

325
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:19,345
What was that?

326
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:20,764
I said, what was that?

327
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:23,933
What, I know you've been talking trash
about me, you son of a bitch!

328
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:26,853
What the hell are you talking about?
Huh?! Huh?!

329
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:30,815
You. Go. Just leave. Fuck off. Shit.

330
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:32,835
- Who do you think you are?
- Hey, hey, hey.

331
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:34,944
You crazy bastard.

332
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:36,780
Damn bitch, what the hell?

333
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:37,864
Let me go!

334
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,258
Hey, hey, hey, let me go!
I said let me go! Shit!

335
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:40,593
You, I told you to leave me alone, shit!
You're dead today!

336
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:41,677
- Calm down, calm down, okay?
- You, come over here.

337
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,054
This crazy bitch wants to die today.

338
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,889
- Fine, it's just...
- Hold on. Hey, let me go for a second.

339
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:47,290
When did I ever have sex with you,
you motherfucker! Huh?

340
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:49,501
What the fuck?
Why would I ever sleep with you?

341
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:51,711
- You bastard. Go fuck yourself!
- Let go!

342
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:53,064
- You, come here!
- Stop with that bullshit.

343
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,690
- I'm going to kill you.
- You motherfucker!

344
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,484
Hey, Sooheon, Sooheon,
it looks like a fight just broke out.

345
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:57,967
Do you want to go check it out?

346
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:59,195
- Hey, Soyeon, calm down.
- Osung, she's a girl.

347
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:01,054
- Ah.
- Uh...

348
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:02,180
You should go watch.

349
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:04,099
No, it's fine. Those pathetic fools.

350
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:06,518
Aren't they too old to fight like that?

351
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:08,603
- Hey, Nakjun.
- Yeah?

352
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,164
You seem interested in the fight.
You should go.

353
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:11,815
Nah, come on. I'm not curious.

354
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:14,859
Hey, Ajung, who's fighting
who in your class right now?

355
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:15,944
Gi Osung and Tae Soyeon.

356
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,737
Huh? Why? Hold on.

357
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,656
See? Answer the question, bitch.

358
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:22,200
Why don't you start
talking like you did earlier?

359
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,952
Hey, calm down, calm down.

360
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,957
Why don't you just hit me?

361
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,805
<i>When the suspect
called my phone, it was...</i>

362
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:44,722
The 8th...

363
00:19:44,806 --> 00:19:47,058
<i>8:17 p.m.
on the night of the 8th.</i>

00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,862
CLASS 4 KANG YOUNGHOON
JAEBUM HYUNG'S MOTHER

365
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:52,397
He got a new cell phone.

366
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,065
There's no call log.

367
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:57,336
FIND MY PHONE YOUR CELLPHONE SIGNAL
WAS FOUND WITHIN 100M FROM YOU

368
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,239
You dared to steal my phone
when I just lost one 4 days ago?

369
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:02,574
GI OSUNG

370
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:04,242
You're fucking dead.

375
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:53,082
Ah, fuck. Filthy thief.

376
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:57,587
He put my phone in the toilet and ran off.

377
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,597
Fucking thief!

378
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:10,775
When I find you,
I'm going to tear you apart.

379
00:21:14,312 --> 00:21:15,912
PLEASE WASH THE MOP
THOROUGHLY AFTER USE.

380
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:03,289
The places
include South and North Korea...

381
00:22:05,154 --> 00:22:07,198
and the Indian Ocean,
which is a neutral space,

382
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,700
where the protagonist goes.

383
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:10,623
It's from an omniscient
writer's point of view.

384
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:16,082
This topic is ideological conflict
and the way...

385
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:23,172
Gi Osung got a new phone?

386
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:26,175
Seems like he did 4 days ago.

387
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:29,137
It was brand new, and there was
no call history before 5 days ago.

388
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:31,139
Why would he replace it?

389
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:33,474
He said he got a new one
because he lost it.

390
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:35,935
But the timing
is what makes it suspicious.

391
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:38,396
He probably tried to hide the evidence.

392
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,874
Do you think it's possible
that he might've started to notice

393
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:43,378
and got rid of my brother's phone
and the rest of the evidence?

394
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:48,948
GI WANGDO

395
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:11,012
Sergeant Hyun.

396
00:23:11,095 --> 00:23:13,264
- What brings you here?
- Oh, yes, Chief.

397
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:15,767
- Hello.
- Hello.

398
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,976
Oh, these are my kids.

399
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,227
Hi.

400
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:19,145
Welcome.

401
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:21,814
Excuse me, ma'am,
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

402
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:23,584
I'll bring you a cup of coffee
in the reading room.

403
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:24,608
So...

404
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:26,903
What is it? Let's go in. Yeah.

405
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:32,491
Mom.

406
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:35,620
I've seen that investigator at school.

407
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:37,723
Do you think he's here
because of the incident at school?

408
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:39,224
He probably didn't come
for the investigation.

409
00:23:39,248 --> 00:23:40,541
It must be a personal matter.

410
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:36,097
Gwon Sejin?

411
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:53,489
Um...

412
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:54,573
Thank you.

413
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:56,032
But...

414
00:24:56,701 --> 00:24:57,910
are you sure?

415
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,166
Are you sure Ji Sooheon
isn't the one who killed Wonseok?

416
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:04,375
It's not him.

417
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,586
Ji Sooheon's not the murderer.

418
00:25:07,545 --> 00:25:09,881
The real culprit is someone else,
I'm sure.

419
00:25:10,548 --> 00:25:12,484
Ah, I'm hundred percent sure
I saw the suspect running away.

420
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:14,361
The murderer was wearing a pair
of white sneakers with red shoelaces.

421
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:15,845
White sneakers with red shoelaces.

422
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:19,783
I don't recall anyone else wearing
those shoes other than Ji Sooheon...

423
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:22,602
Then are you saying the suspect
is pretending to be like Ji Sooheon?

424
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:24,145
Why me...

425
00:25:24,228 --> 00:25:25,771
So you're saying it's someone else?

426
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:26,855
Who is it?

427
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:38,451
Well, I guess you guys
don't know yet either.

428
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:42,830
Hey, Ji Sooheon.

429
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:46,292
Sorry I suspected you.

430
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,376
It's okay.

431
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:49,879
It's all good.

432
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:53,674
Chanmi, I'm sorry.

433
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:57,261
I'm sorry for breaking your windows...

434
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:01,474
breaking the things inside the room,
and ripping up your uniform.

435
00:26:01,557 --> 00:26:02,600
What?

436
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:05,311
Were you... were you the one who did that?

437
00:26:05,394 --> 00:26:09,148
I mean, after I told you that Ji Sooheon
was the suspect,

438
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:11,817
nothing came of it after that.

439
00:26:13,653 --> 00:26:16,572
So I came here,
wondering why, only to see that

440
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:19,700
you were living with Ji Sooheon.

441
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,996
That's when I felt totally betrayed,
and I couldn't forgive you for it.

442
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:28,000
I'll be going over to the United States
this weekend.

443
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:31,379
Since I didn't have much time left,

444
00:26:31,462 --> 00:26:34,632
I couldn't bear to leave
without taking care of Ji Sooheon first.

445
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:37,218
So that's why
it all went down like this today.

446
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:38,803
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:41,389
You must have been really angry then, huh?

448
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:45,518
I almost died in the scooter accident.

449
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,060
A scooter accident?

450
00:26:49,522 --> 00:26:50,606
What?

451
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,650
Aren't you the one who

452
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:55,152
cut the brake on my scooter?

453
00:26:56,237 --> 00:26:59,115
What? What are you talking about?
That wasn't me.

454
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:09,917
So, what brings you here
at this time of night?

455
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:12,628
Um, Chief...

456
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:16,465
It's about what we talked about
in the briefing,

457
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:18,109
about the murder case at the body shop.

458
00:27:18,134 --> 00:27:19,802
What? You're here to talk about the case?

459
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,389
I thought it was about something personal.

460
00:27:23,472 --> 00:27:26,512
Hey, I thought you were about to tell me
you're getting married or something.

461
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:28,436
So what's up?

462
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,062
- Tell me.
- It's...

463
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:34,567
about the receipt with the barcode.

464
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,650
Yeah, what about it?

465
00:27:38,571 --> 00:27:39,405
It was torn off from a receipt
that was used

466
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:40,799
as an entrance pass to a study café.

467
00:27:40,823 --> 00:27:43,701
It was a reading room years ago,
but now it's a study cafe...

468
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:44,785
Yeah, yeah I know it.

469
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,830
Osung and Jihyun go there sometimes.

470
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:50,291
Ah, I see!

471
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:53,085
So the receipt is part of an entrance pass
to the study café?

472
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:58,966
If you check the barcode,
you'll know who used the pass.

473
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:02,386
If you check
the surveillance footage there...

474
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,056
we can see for certain who it is.

475
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:27,745
Hey, Jongguk, what's going on?

476
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:31,540
Who was it?

477
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:36,462
It's Gi Osung.

478
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:40,549
Hey, man, what are you talking about?

479
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,259
Hey...

480
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,720
Hey, hey, tell me. Who was it, really?

481
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:54,145
Jongguk.

482
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:56,273
Jongguk, hey.

483
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:59,235
Are you sure it was Osung?

484
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:02,363
Yes.

485
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:05,074
It actually is

486
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:07,076
your son's receipt.

487
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:13,541
That doesn't necessarily mean...

488
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:18,754
Osung was at the murder scene, does it?
It's not direct evidence, is it?

489
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:20,923
No, sir.

490
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,218
So what we need to figure out is...

491
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:27,138
why Osung's receipt was

492
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:29,014
at the crime scene?

493
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:30,975
Yes, Chief.

494
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:32,518
Are you...

495
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:35,312
Are you the only one

496
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:39,984
who knows it was Osung's receipt?

497
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:44,238
I've yet to report
this to detective Jin Sojung.

498
00:29:45,156 --> 00:29:47,199
Is there some reason why you haven't?

499
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:53,122
I thought I should report
to you first, Chief.

500
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:57,168
And wait to follow your order.

501
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:58,377
Good.

Hey, Seok Jaebum.

507
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:18,396
Oh?

508
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:20,274
So you guys take this one too?

509
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:22,669
Jaebum, I thought you always
came to school in a Rolls Royce.

510
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:24,129
I'm going to be taking the bus
from now on.

511
00:30:24,153 --> 00:30:26,989
Jaebum, are you trying out
the life of a commoner?

512
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:28,907
Nope.

513
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:30,868
I just prefer a bigger vehicle.

514
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:39,210
Are you done fraternizing with him?

515
00:30:39,293 --> 00:30:41,504

are from the same middle school.

Did you even know each other
in middle school?

519
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:50,805
He's the grandson of a corporate mogul.
Everyone knew him.

520
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,348
I knew about Ajung as well.

521
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:53,867
She's a greater dancer
and good at singing too.

522

knows who I am.

524
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:06,111
<i>I've finished
checking Gi Osung's cell phone location.</i>

525
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:09,532
He wasn't near the scene of the crime

526
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:11,408
from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. the next day.

527
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:14,495
Is that right?

528
00:31:14,578 --> 00:31:16,978
According to the log,
he was near the study café at the time.

529
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,167
Oh, I see, he was studying.

530
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:25,881
But according to the entrance log
at the study café...

531
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:29,426
There was no record of him
entering the café after 6 o'clock.

532
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:32,053
So then...

533
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:35,099
Ah, so what are you saying happened?

534
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:41,605
Do you mean he left his cellphone
in the study café and then left?

535
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,819
Uh, I mean...

536
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:52,199
I'll ask Osung about this directly.

537
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,995
Jongguk, so, um...
can you keep this information to yourself

538
00:31:56,078 --> 00:31:56,996
for just one more day?

539
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,206
I'll follow your orders, Chief, but...

540
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:02,209
it seems like the victim in the case,

541
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:04,773
Ju Hyeokgeon graduated
from the same middle school as Gi Osung.

542
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,256
Gi Osung is a year older.

543
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:10,402
When Ju Hyeokgeon committed the murder
as a juvenile delinquent,

544
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:14,263
Gi Osung was attending
the same middle school.

545
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:21,854
After I leave work today,

546
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:26,275
I'll get the truth out of my son.

547
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:33,501
So please keep these records to yourself
until tomorrow, understood?

548
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:35,743
Yes, Chief.

549
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,747
POLICE
SPECIAL SURRENDER PERIOD

550
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:42,541
Uh? Sergeant Hyun...

551
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:51,300
POLICE POLICE
CHIEF'S OFFICE

552
00:33:13,656 --> 00:33:14,698
What's up?

553
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:17,135
You know how I wasn't able
to take the practice exam

554
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:18,535
because I've been ditching class?

555
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:20,663
I'm worried about you.
What's going on with you?

556
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,791
I know you're pretty busy,
but can I ask you for a favor?

557
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,710
Could you tutor me?

558
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:27,920
A private lesson?

559
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:29,088
Oh...

560
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:34,009
Sure, where should we study?

561
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:36,679
Well, wherever's most convenient
for you...

562
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:38,347
A study café?

563
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:43,394
All my materials are at home, so...

564
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:44,853
Why don't you come to my house?

565
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:47,481
Would that be okay?

566
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:49,459
Well, I don't see why not.
We'll just be studying.

567
00:33:49,483 --> 00:33:51,483
Let's head to my house together
once class is over.

568
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:56,365
Jihyun, thank you.

569
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:57,950
Psh, you're welcome.

570
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:09,211
Chanmi.

571
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:11,879
Hey.

572
00:34:17,886 --> 00:34:19,847
- Jaebum.
- Yeah?

573
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,849
Can I ask you for a favor?

574
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:23,726
Yeah, what is it?

575
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:26,729
I have something to talk
to Gi Osung about.

576
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:29,148
Could you be there with me
when I talk to him?

577
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:31,001
You want me to be there
when you're talking to him?

578
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:32,025
Yeah.

579
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:35,362
I fought with Kook Jihyun once,

580
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:37,948
Gi Osung fought with Tae Soyeon.

581
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,120
And I don't want things
to be like this forever.

582
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:44,121
That's why I thought I should apologize
and try to reconcile with him.

583
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:48,125
But I felt it might be awkward
if I asked him myself.

584
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:49,376
Okay.

585
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,420
I'll ask Osung about it.

586
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:53,797
Oh, so, when?

587
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:55,257
After school today.

588
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,467
Today?

589
00:34:57,051 --> 00:35:00,554
I don't think
I'll have any free time otherwise.

590
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:04,308
Please, I'd really appreciate it.

591
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:07,603
Okay, I'll arrange for him to meet you.

592
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:10,481
Thank you, thank you so much.

593
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:24,661
HYUN JONGGUK, SERGEANT,
INVESTIGATION TEAM 1

594
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:26,222
Hello, this is the Special Victims Unit
at the Yongtan Police Department.

595
00:35:26,246 --> 00:35:29,333
<i>Yeah, can I talk
to Detective Hyun Jongguk?</i>

596
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,710
He's currently out of office.
How can I help you?

597
00:35:31,794 --> 00:35:32,994
<i>I wanted to ask some questions</i>

598
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:35,315
<i>about what he's going to do
with the surveillance footage.</i>

599
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,007
What footage?

600
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:40,135
<i>You know, Detective Hyun checked it
when he stopped by my shop yesterday.</i>

601
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:42,739
<i>I'm calling from the study café
where the torn receipt was from.</i>

602
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,057
I see, yes, yes.

603
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,601
<i>So, what are you going to do
with the recordings?</i>

604
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:50,163
<i>If I reactivate the surveillance camera,
the old recordings will be gone.</i>

605
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:52,415
<i>In fact, I'm currently operating my store
without the cameras on.</i>

606
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:54,900
Please don't...
don't activate it just yet.

607
00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:56,568
I'll be right there.

608
00:35:56,652 --> 00:35:57,861
What is the address there?

609
00:35:59,863 --> 00:36:00,864
This.

610
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:02,783
Yeah. That's right. The entrance pass.

611
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:05,494
It looks just like what the male detective
showed me yesterday

612
00:36:10,249 --> 00:36:12,835
So where is the recording?

613
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:16,004
Ugh, here. Here it is.

614
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:19,216
You guys are going about this
really inefficiently.

615
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:20,467
Oh, sir.

616
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:23,262
Can you zoom in a bit?

617
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:24,263
Sure, sure.

618
00:36:24,346 --> 00:36:25,722
Here.

619
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:27,349
CAM-ENTRANCE

620
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:31,353
GI OSUNG

621
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:35,440
The Chief's son?

622
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,741
Tell me whatever you want to have today.
I'll prepare it for you.

623
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:47,786
Why don't we have some <i>kalguksu</i> today?

624
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:50,706
With some clams and zucchini?

625
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:53,000
- And some fresh kimchi to top it off.
- What the...

626
00:37:04,595 --> 00:37:05,637
Excuse me.

627
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:08,724
You recognize me, right?

628
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:12,227
I'm Min Seonha's dad.

629
00:37:13,937 --> 00:37:15,814
I thought you were a college student,

630
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:18,298
but it seems you're actually
just one year older than Seonha.

631
00:37:31,997 --> 00:37:33,165
Mr. Min.

632
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,836
Why don't we talk inside?

633
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:47,095
Seems like
I'm having a bad makeup day.

634
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:48,347
It's fine, just stop.

635
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,473
PILSEUNG EXPRESS

636
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:53,852
I never imagined that I'd ever go
to an OBGYN with you.

637
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:55,896
And you think I would've seen this coming?

638
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:06,323
Do you know him?

639
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:08,659
No.

640
00:38:18,168 --> 00:38:19,211
<i>So...</i>

641
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:22,089
that's when I found out you live here.

642
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:24,883
The reason why I came here today is...

643
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:29,513
It's okay. You can keep talking.

644
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,683
My friend knows about what happened.

645
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:35,602
Thanks to you...

646
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,772
Seonha was doing just fine,

647
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:45,112
until that bastard Sa Junggyeong
showed up again.

648
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:47,738
Sa Junggyeong...

649
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:49,700
I'll get to the point.

650
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:52,787
I guess I'm asking you
to take care of him again.

651
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,746
This time, please make sure

652
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:59,876
he won't ever dare to appear
before Seonha, ever again.

653
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:02,879
Please tell that person...

654
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:04,923
that I need his help.

655
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:17,954
That place was pretty good.
Let's go there again sometime.

656
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:19,738
Oh, I didn't think it was good,
to be honest.

657
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:24,401
Oh, Detective Jin.

658
00:39:24,484 --> 00:39:27,404
You look tired.
Why don't you head home early today?

659
00:39:33,535 --> 00:39:35,203
You crazy bastard.

660
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:36,580
Are you even human?

661
00:39:36,663 --> 00:39:38,182
Detective Jin, why are you doing this?

662
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:39,809
Detective Jin,
what are you doing right now?

663
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,209
Why am I doing this?

664
00:39:41,918 --> 00:39:43,962
You call yourself a cop, you bastard?

665
00:39:44,671 --> 00:39:48,050
How could you go straight
to the Chief's office with that evidence?

666
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,886
You filthy bastard.

667
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:53,263
How dare you stand there
like you've done nothing wrong?

668
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:54,514
You son of a bitch!

669
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:57,100
How could you do this to me?

670
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,478
You bastard!

671
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:01,897
Get lost, you bastard, let me go!

672
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:13,283
Why isn't Ok Chanmi coming?

673
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,243
Jaebum, why don't you give her a call?

674
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:17,371
You know I did just a few minutes ago.

675
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:19,894
She said she's on her way,
so let's just wait a little longer.

676
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:22,894
She's the one who asked to meet.
She should have come before me.

677
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:42,813
This is my house.

678
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:44,773
It's nice.

679
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:46,936
You've never been
to this side of the town, have you?

680
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:50,529
<i>Are you there?</i>

681
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:51,530
OK CHANMMI
ARE YOU THERE?

682
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:52,613
<i>Yes.</i>

683
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:56,118
Come in.

684
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:57,411
Are you uncomfortable at all?

685
00:40:57,494 --> 00:40:59,204
No, not at all.

686
00:40:59,287 --> 00:41:00,414
No one's home.

687
00:41:00,497 --> 00:41:01,857
Wouldn't that be more comfortable?

688
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:03,375
Yeah, for sure.

689
00:41:23,186 --> 00:41:24,604
Where should we study?

690
00:41:24,688 --> 00:41:26,231
My room is on the second floor.

691
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:28,114
But I guess the kitchen table
would be better?

692
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,860
Oh, yeah. I think so, too.

693
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,449
So where's Gi Osung's room?

694
00:41:35,782 --> 00:41:36,783
Over there.

695
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:40,179
I'm just going to change
into something more comfortable.

696
00:41:40,203 --> 00:41:41,204
Oh, okay.

697
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:57,864
Hey, Sooheon.

698
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:00,325
Should we start studying?

699
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:02,118
Ah, I'm really sorry,

700
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,663
but can we have some ramen
before we start studying?

701
00:43:04,746 --> 00:43:06,164
Oh, really?

702
00:43:06,248 --> 00:43:07,391
Do you want me to cook it for you?

703
00:43:07,415 --> 00:43:09,626
Um, sure. Thanks.

704
00:43:10,669 --> 00:43:11,979
When I cook ramen, my family goes crazy.

705
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:13,773
They keep telling me
I should start a restaurant.

706
00:43:13,797 --> 00:43:15,131
Hold on just a moment.

707
00:43:15,924 --> 00:43:17,300
I'm so sorry.

708
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:19,904
It's fine. You're my guest.
Of course I have to make it for you.

709
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:28,019
Do you mind if I add an egg to your ramen?

710
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:29,688
Oh, yeah.

711
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:30,771
Thanks.

712
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,650
MA_ROCKROCK THERE'S A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR
WHO WENT UP A MOUNTAIN

713
00:43:58,842 --> 00:43:59,843
Jaebum.

714
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,304
What are we even doing here?

715
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:03,930
I'll send Chanmi a text.

716
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:08,059
JIHYEONY
HAS UPLOADED A NEW POST

717
00:44:09,144 --> 00:44:12,314
JIHYEONY
HOME

718
00:44:12,397 --> 00:44:13,398
What?

719
00:44:13,481 --> 00:44:14,649
Jihyun's home.

720
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:18,820
<i>Seems like studying was just an excuse.</i>

721
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:21,132
<i>Was your true goal to have ramen
with Ji Sooheon? Don't cross the line.</i>

722
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:23,437
<i>Sooheon, would you like
to have ramen with me at my place?</i>

723
00:44:24,326 --> 00:44:26,369
Osung, Chanmi says she's almost here.

724
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:30,290
Huh?

725
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:40,967
OK CHANMI

726
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,815
Fucking shit.

727
00:45:39,275 --> 00:45:41,152
Ji Sooheon, you bastard.

728
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:52,747
What were you doing in my room, bastard?

729
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,918
Why would I go into your room?

730
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:57,919
I didn't go in there.

731
00:45:58,002 --> 00:46:00,338
Don't lie to me, you bastard!

732
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:03,091
What did you do in my room?
Answer me! What did you do? Hey, Osung!

733
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:04,968
What are you doing?

734
00:46:05,051 --> 00:46:06,970
You stole my phone earlier today.

735
00:46:07,053 --> 00:46:08,638
I saw it was you, you bastard.

736
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:10,056
What are you talking about?

737
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,224
Come on!

738
00:46:11,307 --> 00:46:12,809
You bastard!

739
00:46:25,113 --> 00:46:26,281
Gi Osung.

740
00:46:26,364 --> 00:46:27,657
Who are you?

741
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:30,285
I'm Detective Jin Sojung,

742
00:46:30,368 --> 00:46:31,846
from the Special Victim's Unit
of Yongtan Police Station.

743
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,371
My father's not home yet.

744
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:36,124
I need you to come with me
to the police station.

745
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:37,768
Why should I follow you
to the police station?

746
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:39,043
You're under arrest.

747
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:40,545
What?

748
00:46:40,628 --> 00:46:42,297
Under arrest?

749
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,966
What are you talking about?
What have I done to get arrested?

750
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:47,177
I'll call my father now.

751
00:46:48,344 --> 00:46:49,804
He already knows about this.

752
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,308
I'm arresting you to prevent
possible destruction of evidence.

753
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:55,935
Damn it! I haven't done anything!
Let me go.

754
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:58,300
Follow me without resisting,
or I'll put handcuffs on you.

755
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:02,776
Hey, Kook Jihyun.

756
00:47:03,943 --> 00:47:05,653
Call father right now.

757
00:47:29,427 --> 00:47:31,805
Neunghwa Nursing Home

758
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,689
119 EMERGENCY

759
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:55,411
Are you okay?

760
00:47:55,495 --> 00:47:56,830
Gi Osung just ran off suddenly.

761
00:47:56,913 --> 00:47:58,373
We met.

762
00:47:58,456 --> 00:47:59,499
What happened?

763
00:47:59,582 --> 00:48:01,125
Actually, so many things happened.

764
00:48:01,918 --> 00:48:03,378
I don't even know where to start.

765
00:48:04,003 --> 00:48:06,798
Okay, there wasn't a phone
in Gi Osung's room.

766
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:09,259
Park Wonseok's wasn't there either.

767
00:48:10,677 --> 00:48:12,262
Really?

768
00:48:12,345 --> 00:48:14,145
But I found something else
that was strange...

769
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:16,764
There were lots of polaroid photos
in his drawer...

770
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,727
MOM'S NURSING HOME

771
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:20,854
Hold on.

772
00:48:20,937 --> 00:48:21,937
Okay.

773
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,480
Hello?

774
00:48:24,357 --> 00:48:26,359
Yes, hello, ma'am.

775
00:48:28,027 --> 00:48:29,153
What?

776
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:31,489
My mom?

777
00:48:32,282 --> 00:48:33,491
Uh...

778
00:48:34,284 --> 00:48:36,077
Which hospital is she in right now?

779
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:09,277
CRITICAL CARE UNIT

780
00:49:09,736 --> 00:49:13,448
Her heart wasn't beating when she arrived,
so we tried to resuscitate her.

781
00:49:13,531 --> 00:49:15,700
Now she's on a ventilator.

782
00:49:15,783 --> 00:49:18,143
We'll just try to keep her on life support
from here on out.

783
00:49:19,412 --> 00:49:20,705
Are you saying...

784
00:49:21,748 --> 00:49:24,375
it's unlikely she'll wake up again?

785
00:49:27,587 --> 00:49:29,589
But she's alive.

786
00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:32,050
Yes, she is.

787
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:33,801
And there could be a miracle, right?

788
00:49:33,885 --> 00:49:36,054
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this

789
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:37,364
but you and your family should discuss

790
00:49:37,388 --> 00:49:39,807
whether you'll continue
to keep her on life support.

791
00:49:39,891 --> 00:49:41,476
It's because of the cost.

792
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:44,520
Once the cost reaches a certain point
you'll be billed right away.

793
00:49:44,604 --> 00:49:45,897
If the bill isn't paid,

794
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,609
it will be difficult for us to continue
the life support treatment.

795
00:49:51,277 --> 00:49:52,278
Okay.

796
00:49:52,737 --> 00:49:54,614
I'll get the money together
no matter what.

797
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:57,450
Please.

798
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:00,912
Just keep my mother alive.

799
00:50:26,312 --> 00:50:28,398
Hey, stop crying.

800
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:32,235
Why are you crying?

801
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:35,530
Because I feel so sorry.

802
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:40,576
I can't do anything for you.

803
00:50:41,953 --> 00:50:43,579
I'm so sorry.

804
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:04,767
INNO MOTORS

805
00:51:06,352 --> 00:51:08,479
I've never been there before.

806
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:11,774
And I have no idea
why my study café receipt

807
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:13,735
was found there.

808
00:51:15,945 --> 00:51:19,073
On that day, from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.,
I was sleeping at home.

809
00:51:19,157 --> 00:51:21,176
How many times do I have
to repeat this simple fact?

810
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,619
Your father, Gi Wangdo,
the head of the police station

811
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:28,958
hid the fact that this pass is yours.
Why would he do that?

812
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:32,295
You should be asking my father that.

813
00:51:34,756 --> 00:51:36,758
What's your relationship with Ji Sooheon?

814
00:51:36,841 --> 00:51:39,194
We go to the same school.
What other relation would we have?

815
00:51:39,218 --> 00:51:42,138
Have you ever lent him
your study café pass?

816
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:46,142
Nope.

817
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,188
Why did you leave your cell phone
at the café?

818
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:51,591
I tend to be forgetful sometimes.

819
00:51:53,357 --> 00:51:55,277
Are you implying
that I left it there on purpose?

820
00:51:55,693 --> 00:51:58,488
Who did you meet that day?

821
00:51:58,571 --> 00:52:01,699
Everyone at school.

822
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:09,665
Detective Jin, I'm sorry.

823
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,960
- Come out for a second.
- Yes, sir.

824
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,263
TOWER STUDIO APARTMENT
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

825
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:33,397
If you're trying to persuade me,
I'll just head downstairs.

826
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:35,149
You have me all wrong.

827
00:52:36,025 --> 00:52:37,944
Detective Jin, I'm sorry.

828
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:40,308
I had no intention
of sweeping the evidence under the rug.

829
00:52:40,822 --> 00:52:44,534
As a father,
all I wanted was to protect my son.

830
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,788
Look, there might be a possibility

831
00:52:49,413 --> 00:52:51,332
that my son didn't do anything wrong,

832
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:55,461
and that he just got involved
in the case by chance.

833
00:52:56,003 --> 00:52:59,423
I thought it might be a shock for him
to be treated as a suspect,

834
00:52:59,507 --> 00:53:00,925
as young as he is.

835
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,264
I shouldn't have entertained that thought.

836
00:53:06,973 --> 00:53:09,100
It was my mistake. I'm sorry.

837
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:12,228
If you ever try to intervene
in the investigation from this point on,

838
00:53:12,812 --> 00:53:14,522
I'll resign.

839
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,109
And you'll have to prepare to do the same.

840
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,803
What the fuck is this?
Saying whatever the fuck you want.

841
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:47,597
Hey, he's got jack shit.

842
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,723
He just won the jackpot.

843
00:53:48,806 --> 00:53:50,224
- I mean, fuck.
- Hey, hey, hey.

844
00:53:50,308 --> 00:53:51,350
That's a stretch.

845
00:53:51,434 --> 00:53:53,227
Honestly, you suck at this.

846
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:55,021
Ha, fuck off. Get out of my house, shit.

847
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:55,980
Idiot.

848
00:53:56,063 --> 00:53:57,332
Hey, open the door and come on in.

849
00:53:57,356 --> 00:53:58,916
Okay, I'll call. It's 100 thousand won.

850
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:01,194
Huh?

851
00:54:01,277 --> 00:54:02,403
Gi Osung?

852
00:54:03,154 --> 00:54:05,364
Wow, Gi Osung, what brings you here?

853
00:54:05,448 --> 00:54:07,992
Hey, shit, come here. Have a drink.

854
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:09,075
Yeah.

855
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:11,704
Let's talk.

856
00:54:14,582 --> 00:54:16,542
What? Shit. Now?

857
00:54:18,544 --> 00:54:20,129
Get ready to lose when I come back.

858
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:28,804
Hey, what's up? What happened?

859
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:32,284
I'm coming from the police station
because I'm under investigation.

860
00:54:32,308 --> 00:54:34,185
You? Why?

861
00:54:34,268 --> 00:54:35,978
Because of the guy who crushed your foot.

862
00:54:36,312 --> 00:54:37,521
Have they found that bastard?

863
00:54:37,939 --> 00:54:39,232
Nope.

864
00:54:39,315 --> 00:54:41,150
The bastard had one more run,

865
00:54:41,234 --> 00:54:42,944
but this time he tried to frame me for it.

866
00:54:44,737 --> 00:54:46,822
Are you under investigation because of it?

867
00:54:47,907 --> 00:54:49,551
We really should find
that bastard and kill him.

868
00:54:49,575 --> 00:54:50,952
Keep this to yourself.

869
00:54:52,286 --> 00:54:55,015
This is just something I noticed
while they were questioning me, but...

870
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:56,374
I think the bastard is...

871
00:55:00,586 --> 00:55:02,046
Ji Sooheon.

872
00:55:06,008 --> 00:55:07,468
Ji Sooheon.

873
00:55:08,678 --> 00:55:09,887
That bastard?

874
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:38,040
Who is it?

875
00:55:38,124 --> 00:55:39,750
It's me, Sooheon.

876
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:47,550
It's pretty late. What's up?

877
00:55:54,223 --> 00:55:56,225
What is it you want to tell me?

878
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:57,518
Tell me.

879
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:00,312
Hey, Soyeon.

880
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:04,275
Let's do it one more time.

881
00:56:06,235 --> 00:56:07,778
Let's beat up those bastards

882
00:56:08,195 --> 00:56:09,572
and get paid for it.

883
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:15,661
Have you gone mad?

884
00:56:16,871 --> 00:56:18,956
Did you forget
that you're still a suspect?

885
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,249
Are you serious?

886
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,835
I need money, desperately.

887
00:56:23,836 --> 00:56:24,837
My mother

888
00:56:25,755 --> 00:56:27,882
is in the ICU now.

889
00:56:29,592 --> 00:56:32,511
She can't survive
without being on life support.

890
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:39,435
Still, we can't do it.

891
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:41,353
It's too dangerous.

892
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:43,856
It will be okay.

893
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,736
- Just one more time...
- You must be crazy!

894
00:56:49,695 --> 00:56:51,864
Get your head on straight.

895
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:54,075
It seriously can't happen.

896
00:56:55,576 --> 00:56:56,786
Leave.

897
00:56:57,203 --> 00:56:58,883
Just leave
if you're going to say nonsense.

898
00:56:59,538 --> 00:57:00,664
I said get lost!

899
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:01,748
Hey.

900
00:57:01,791 --> 00:57:02,875
Go.

901
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:05,127
I told you.

902
00:57:05,503 --> 00:57:07,797
Hey, get out of here.

903
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:11,926
PILSEUNG EXPRESS

904
00:57:25,147 --> 00:57:26,565
Hello.

905
00:57:27,316 --> 00:57:29,026
Do you remember me?

906
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,820
Oh, of course. Of course.

907
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:33,906
But hey, what brings you here?

908
00:57:35,658 --> 00:57:38,661
I have something to tell you.

909
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:45,584
We'll do it.
