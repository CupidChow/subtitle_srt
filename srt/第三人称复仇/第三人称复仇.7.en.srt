What are you doing?

11
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,078
I think you're misunderstanding something.

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,110
You can take the bag to the police.

15
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,989
I didn't kill him.

25

Have you gone mad?

26
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,383
Hey, explain this to me.
What are you trying to do?

27
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,659
Don't move!
(shaky breathing)

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,037
Hey, come on! Why are you doing this?!

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,749
Okay, fine.
With Sa Junggyeong, that was me.

30
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,251
I'm the one who crushed his foot.

31
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,630
But what does that have to do with you?

32
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,256

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,425
I didn't kill
that damn juvenile delinquent!

34

(whimpers)
Why did you kill...

35
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,056
my older brother?

36
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,604
What did you say?

37
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,397

38
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,833

Shut up! You bastard!
(sniffs)

40
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,319
There's evidence.

41
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,571
Why would I kill him, why?

42
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,716
You're the one
who should be answering that question.

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,866
Why did you?

44
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,868
(sobs)
Why did you kill him, why?

45
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,080
You demonic bastard.

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,543
How dare you smile at me
after killing my brother?

47
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,545
How dare you even talk to me?

48
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,964

If you really believe that I killed him,

57
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,539
I'll go ahead and kill myself.

58
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,708
So tell me.

59
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,710

who killed Park Wonseok?

93
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,329
Why would you have killed Park Wonseok?

94
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,173
It's just not true.
Why would you think that?

95
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,292
Jaebum, what did I tell you

96
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,478
when you brought that photo
of you and Park Wonseok to school?

97
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,105
Didn't I tell you?
You didn't even know Park Wonseok.

98
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,849
How could I not know him if we had taken
a polaroid picture like that

99
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,924
at this race track?

100
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,968
That's why I'm suspecting.

101
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,051
Maybe you're lying to me

102
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,738
because I did something bad
to Park Wonseok.

103
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,762
Jaebum.

104
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,100
How far back can you remember?

105
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,311
How far?

106
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,771
Is your memory
slowly coming back to you these days?

107
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,817
I think so.

108
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,444
Don't trust your memory, Jaebum.

109
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,453
You'll be in big trouble
if you do, seriously.

110
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,032
Your memories might not be real.

111
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,176
You never know
if it's just part of your imagination,

112
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,452
so don't trust your memories.

113
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,996
(sighs)
So are you saying

114
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,599
that it wasn't a suicide
and that it was in fact a car accident?

115
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,585
Where did it happen?
What kind of accident was it?

116
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,046
Was it a car collision? Was I jaywalking?

117
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,549
It's true that you were trying
to commit suicide.

118
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,549
You...

119
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,302
jumped.

120
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,638
Don't tell your parents
your memory came back.

121
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,325
It was actually your parents

122
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,893
who decided to tell you
that it was a car accident.

123
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,687
Where did I jump from?

124
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,731
From the building
of your parents' company nearby.

125
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,649
Why?

126
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,944
Do you know the reason why?

127
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,697
No, I don't.
I don't know why you tried to jump.

128
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,657
There was no suicide note.

- (indistinct chatter)
- STUDENT 1: Good one.

185
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,595
STUDENT 2: That was so close.

186
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,740
- OSUNG: Hey, I'm heading out.
- STUDENT 1: Okay. Good job. Take care.

187
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,724
- Bye.
- Okay, see you next week.

188
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,852
(chuckles)

189
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,896
(sighs)

190
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,898
(breathes heavily)

191
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,983
(cell phone ringing)

192
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,486
INCOMING CALL
SA JUNGGYEONG

193
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,574
(sighs)

194
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,745
Jaebum, sorry to keep you waiting.

195
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,496
Hey.

196
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,226
Why were you playing basketball
when you were supposed to meet with me?

197
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,794
(sighs lightly)
Sorry.

198
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,563
It's just that if I didn't join,
they wouldn't have been able to play.

199
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,963
It was three against three.

200
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,674
Then you could have called...

201
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,009
(sighs)

202
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,720
So, do you remember now?

203
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,484
Do you remember why you committed suicide?

204
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,349
(slurps)

205
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,684
(exhales deeply)

206
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,429
Can you really not remember?

207
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,479
Memories aren't something
you can bring back

208
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,356
just because you think hard and focus.

209
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,692
Well, maybe it will just pop up randomly?

210
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,903
With some sort of a triggering event
or a shock?

211
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,615
I did exactly
what you told me to do, Osung.

212
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,733
I went back to the office building
near the horse track,

213
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,372
but I couldn't remember anything at all.

214
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:51,210
I couldn't remember
why I had jumped from there.

215
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,003
By the way,

216
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,527
how were you able to realize
that it wasn't a traffic accident

217
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,601
and that you had
actually attempted suicide?

218
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,053
I guess the feeling of floating mid-air?

219
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,851
For a very long time...

220
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,980
And that fear of falling.

221
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,860
That feeling resurfaced like a nightmare.

222
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,239
That's why I thought

223
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,950
maybe that's what had happened.

224
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,828
You haven't told your parents about this,
have you?

225
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,205
No.
(sighs lightly)

226
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,378
Osung.

227
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,465
Thank you.

228
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,927
You're the only one I can trust.

229
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,365
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

230
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,487
Come on, you're making me feel awkward.
You don't have to thank me.

231
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,643
(chuckles)

232
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,854
(sighs lightly)

233
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,648
You said...

234
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,295
you had something to show me concerning

235
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,239
what happened
between Park Wonseok and me, right?

236
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,585
Jaebum.

237
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,295
I have it here in my bag.

238
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,090
Are you prepared
to take whatever comes out of it?

239
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,300
(exhales deeply)

240
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,928
What do you mean? What is it?

241
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,555
(suspicious music)

242
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,856
This envelope...

243
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,858
The thing inside this envelope...

244
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,820
was once yours.

245
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,530
(paper rustles)

246
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,536
You asked me to hold onto this a few days
before you tried to commit suicide.

247
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,455
I asked you to hold onto this for me?

248
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,749
You told me not to open it
under any circumstances.

249
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,960
But after you jumped,

250
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,087
you lost consciousness
and weren't waking up.

251
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,673
So I opened it.

252
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,925
I feel really bad about that.

253
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,636
(suspenseful music)

254
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,878
So, Jaebum,

255
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,298
that's why I told you

256
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,175
not to mention Park Wonseok to anyone.

257
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,553
(suspenseful music continues)

258
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,826
What are you going to do now?

259
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,411
Well, the last train has left by now.

260
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,639
I'll have to catch the train
early tomorrow morning

261
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,748
and head back to Seoul.

262
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,459
That's not what I meant.

263
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,902
I mean, what are you going to do
about the body shop murder?

264
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,505
You've been framed as the suspect.

265
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,006
(inhales deeply)

266
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,510
Well, I'm not actually being framed,
I'm just a suspect.

267
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,864
What do you call it, a person of interest?

268
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,097
(exhales deeply)

269
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,726
Had it not been for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

270
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,022
I would've been investigated
as the suspect for a murder case.

271
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,524
All we can do is hope
that the real culprit will be caught.

272
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,235
By the way, how did you know?

273
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,745
That the police were looking
for the backpack?

274
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,660
Gi Osung told me.

275
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,328
Gi Osung?

276
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,338
Gi Osung.

277
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,050
I heard you manipulated Park Wonseok
after learning about his weaknesses.

278
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,987
I'm here because I wanted
to hear you elaborate on that.

279
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,639
Is that why you've been waiting
for me in front of my house?

280
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,618
Do you really need to bring up the past?
Wonseok isn't here with us anymore.

281
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,520
I need to find the person
who killed my older brother.

282
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,605
How is the fact
that I manipulated Park Wonseok

283
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,899
related to his murder?

284
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,943
That's why I'm asking you to explain.

285
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,403
(scoffs)

286
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,697
Do you think I'm the one who killed him?

287
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,742
Before I actually catch the killer,

288
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,495
everyone is a suspect in my eyes.

289
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,338
The police are tracking down
the suspect now.

290
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,707
What?

291
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,393
When I went to visit my father
at the police station,

292
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,727
I came across this information
by accident.

293
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,754
(inhales deeply)
Several days ago, there was a murder.

294
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,816
And the police think that the suspect

295
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,592
is the same one who was behind
the dark room assault at our school.

296
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,094
They say it's highly likely

297
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,863
that it's the same person
behind Park Wonseok's case.

298
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,287
They're about to catch the suspect.

299
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,726
What do you mean
they're about to catch the suspect?

300
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,078
It seems they spotted him
on some surveillance footage

301
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,770
at the scene of the crime a few days ago.

302
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,647
I watched the surveillance myself.

303
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,566
So...

304
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,486
I guess they've identified the suspect.

305
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,863
Just his back.

306
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,407
All they have is a photo of him
wearing a backpack.

307
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,324
They said it won't take long
before they catch him.

308
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,829
(gasps)

309
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,473
CHANMI: Suddenly,
I recalled that image of you

310
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,124
when I ran into you in the alley.

311
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,186
I remember thinking it was odd
that you were wearing a backpack

312
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,880
even though you told me you were
on your way back from working out.

313
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,258
(siren blaring in distance)

314
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,972
What the...

315
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,520
(car horn honking)

316
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,109
(suspenseful music)

317
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,324
JI SOOHEON

318
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,034
(lock rattles)

319
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,130
GOGO STADIUM

320
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,715
(gasps)

321
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,675
GOGO STADIUM MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION
NOW OPEN

322
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,600
CHANMI: I thought to myself
that I shouldn't let the police catch you.

323
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,811
Because if you had been caught,

324
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,436
from that point on, I wouldn't have had
the chance to confront you directly.

325
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,900
I wouldn't have been able to ask you
why you did it.

326
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,443
I also wouldn't have been able to...

327
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,364
kill you with my own two hands.

328
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,573
(chuckles)

329
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,684
So I thought it'd be better
not to let the police catch you,

330
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,330
until I had the chance
to catch you myself.

331
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,290
I did almost die at your hands.

332
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,893
(chuckles)
If you hadn't received that call...

333
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,837
Hey, how can you laugh
and joke about what happened?

334
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,339
(inhales deeply)

335
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,342
Life and death is not a big deal.

336
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,612
There's only a small difference
between the two.

337
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,596
Now's not the time for such talk.

338
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,306
Looking ahead...

339
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,227
Death isn't what's waiting
for us after life.

340
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,690
It's more like life and death
are running along parallel tracks.

341
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,403
You can die just by slightly veering
to the other side.

342
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,072
Come on, stop being weird.

343
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,366
Why would you have
any reason to talk about death?

344
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,412
You do realize that I was almost shot
to death today, right?

345
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,456
Damn, come on.

346
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,420
What I mean is, we have to keep on living.

347
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,465
Even when you reach the brink of death,
if you're able to surpass that moment,

348
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,885
your life will continue to go on.

349
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,722
We should do whatever we can to survive.

350
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,351
That's the only responsibility
we have in life.

351
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,146
What you're saying sounds right,
but you're getting on my nerves.

352
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,314
(soft chuckles)

353
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,774
Sorry.

354
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,490
(sighs deeply)

355
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,118
The person that called earlier...

356
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,164
They must be the culprit, right?

357
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,168
That must have been the culprit.

358
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,922
That person must have picked up
my brother's phone

359
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,232
after pushing him out the window.

360
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,383
Why would they turn on the cell phone?

361
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,237
They should know
that it can be tracked down.

362
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,014
Why did they call me with his cell phone?

363
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,642
They must've been keeping
an eye on me, right?

364
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,187
Do you think they were just
trying to mess around with me?

365
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,897
Are they trying to have fun with this?

366
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,566
(sighs)

367
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,109
That son of a bitch.

368
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,696
What are you going to do about the police?

369
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,032
Are you going to tell them

370
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,760
you got a phone call
from Wonseok's cell phone?

371
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,952
No.

372
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,789
(cell phone trilling)

373
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,959
AUTOMATED VOICE (on cell phone):
The person you dialed cannot be reached...

374
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,587
CALL ENDED
JI SOOHEON

375
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,674
(cell phone trilling)

376
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,821
AUTOMATED VOICE (on cell phone):
The person you dialed cannot be reached.

377
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,115
- Please record the message after the tone.
- AJUNG: Soyeon.

378
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,267
Hey, why are you so startled?

379
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,645
You have such a loud voice.
How could I not be startled?

380
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,523
I was going to introduce
you guys formally,

381
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,941
but I guess this is how it goes.

382
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,484
This is my boyfriend.

383
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,069
Why don't you say hello?

384
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,571
- It's nice to meet you, I'm...
- Aren't you Bang Wootak?

385
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,074
- Oh my, what? How did you know?
- (laughs awkwardly)

386
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,953
- He's completely disguised.
- You can just tell he's an idol star.

387
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,833
It's nice to finally meet you.

388
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,168
I've heard a lot about you from Ajung.

389
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,106
Come to think of it, you don't strike me
so much as an idol star.

390
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,274
You're giving me more daddy vibes.

391
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,132
(laughs awkwardly)

392
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,776
Hey, Soyeon, do you really need
to embarrass him like that?

393
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,926
You barely just met.

394
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,013
In any case, if you do so much
as scratch Ajung, you better watch out.

395
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,096
(sighs)

396
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,142
I'll make sure you never work
in the entertainment industry ever again.

397
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,143
(scoffs)

398
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,288
(laughs awkwardly)
I don't know why she's being this way.

399
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,512
I don't know why she's so mad.

400
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,605
Don't worry.

401
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,149
After my contract expires this fall,

402
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,272
I'm going to retire
and fulfill my military service.

403
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,588
Then we'll live together
as a happy family. Just the three of us.

404
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,364
You can say all you want now, but...

405
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,218
regardless, you'll be forced to retire
if you ever go back on your word.

406
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,428
- You can take my word for it.
- (both laugh awkwardly)

407
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,203
I don't know what's gotten into her.

408
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,290
Soyeon, I hope you'll continue
to look out for Ajung

409
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,053
with the same loyalty you have
for her now.

410
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,044
I'm never going to change.

411
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,171
(scoffs)

412
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,798
- Oh no, what to do...
- Oh, my cutie pie.

413
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,135
Ah, she must be emotional
from all the hormones.

414
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,471
- Are you okay?
- I'm just so touched.

415
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,680
- (sighs)
- You're so silly.

416
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,267
WOOTAK: Don't cry, okay, sweetie?

417
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,186
(door beeps)

418
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,195
Did you say your parents went down south?

419
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,490
Yeah, they'll be away
for a while for work.

420
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,618
In that case, maybe I'll stay here
for a while doing prenatal care.

421
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,453
Fine.

422
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,708
You must be tired
from your date today. Rest up.

423
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,751
Hey, Soyeon.

424
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,629
I just thought of this, but...

425
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,149
wouldn't it be fun if the four of us
went out on a double date?

426
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,253
What are you talking about?
I don't have a boyfriend.

427
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,066
You have Ji Sooheon. Just grab him
by the collar and drag him along.

428
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,181
Are you out of your mind?

429
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,475
It's time you already started dating.

430
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,078
It's obvious you have feelings for him,
so just bring him along.

431
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,647
He'll be excited about it as well.

432
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,625
If I were to cuss you out
in a five-minute rap battle,

433
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,710
that wouldn't be good
for your prenatal care, would it?

434
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,444
You punk. I'm going to take a shower.

435
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,240
I already know you've been worried
for the past few days.

436
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,493
- I know it's because of Ji Sooheon.
- Shut the heck up.

437
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,126
(sighs lightly)

438
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,713
CLEAN, HYGIENIC LAUNDROMAT 24/7

439
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,886
(inhales deeply)

440
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,388
(sighs)

441
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,889
What are you going to do now?

442
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,935
Well, I guess
it will all work out somehow.

443
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,806
What do you mean it will all work out?
You're being framed as a murder suspect.

444
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,692
There's nothing I can do about it.

445
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,528
Plus, I did commit a crime.

446
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,573
What you did wasn't a crime.

447
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,741
It was.

448
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,952
I assaulted someone.

449
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,958
I wasn't planning to be a hero,
or whatever everyone else was calling it.

450
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,917
No.

451
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,338
I'm no hero.

452
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,842
I just needed the money.

453
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,012
Money to pay for my mom's medical bills.

454
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,673
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You don't need to do that.

455
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,352
You did the right thing.

456
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,937
(sighs deeply)

457
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,147
(soft laughs)

458
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,900
How did I end up like this?

459
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,859
(inhales deeply)

460
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,319
If you were to ask me yesterday,

461
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,237
I could never have imagined

462
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,840
that I'd be sitting
in a laundromat in Busan.

463
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,616
The same goes for me.

464
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,367
(sighs deeply)

465
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,871
When you make a snowman,

466
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,166
first you insert a stone
to form a snowball.

467
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,753
That's me.

468
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,255
I'm the stone.

469
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,302
I feel like someone inserted me
into a snowball,

470
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,508
and that I'm just being rolled
into something bigger.

471
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,352
The more it rolls, the bigger it gets.

472
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,459
To the point where it's too big for me
to get myself out of it.

473
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,997
A snowball
that's gotten too big to escape.

474
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,506
What you're saying sounds right,
but you're getting on my nerves.

475
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,615
(scoffs)
I'm sorry, okay?

476
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,788
I heard a phone ringing.

477
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,748
What?

478
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,708
When the culprit called me.

479
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,004
CHANMI (on cell phone): Hello.

480
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,448

481
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,009
CHANMI (breathes rapidly on cell phone):
Hello?

482
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,679
Who is this?

483
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,616
- Why do you have Wonseok's cell phone?
- (buzzing over the phone)

484
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,725
(Chanmi shouting)
Hello? Hell...

485
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,062
(fire crackles)

486
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,024
(paper rustles)

487
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,115
(suspenseful music)

488
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,539
(crackling)

489
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,356
(birds chirping)

490
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,860
(waves crashing)

491
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,547

00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,891

494
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,018
(grunts)

495
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,062
(light music)

496
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,460
FORGET I WAS IN BUSAN.
THANKS.

497
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,777
SOOHEON: Forget I was in Busan.

498
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,196
Thanks.

(suspenseful music)

ATTENDANT: Hello? Hello?

507
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,552
(indistinct chatter)

508
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,023
What's with that guy? What's going on?

509
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,984
It's nothing. He's just a detective.

510
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,653
Detective? For Park Wonseok's case?

511
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,874
Oh, right.
There's Sa Junggyeong's case too.

512
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,301
- Is he here to catch the suspect?
- Don't stare at him so much. Let's go.

513
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,370
Hey, watch it! You're dealing
with a pregnant woman, okay?

514
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,705
You crazy...

515
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,380
(rattles)

516
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,307
Oh, may I help you with anything?

517
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,516
Oh.

518
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,312
I'm a detective
at the Yongtan Police Station.

519
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,858
Ji Sooheon parks his bike here
when he comes to school, right?

520
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,234
That's right. Why do you ask?

521
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,737
He was absent yesterday
and didn't come back home.

522
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,905
And he's not at school yet.

523
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,573
Oh, Sooheon's phone's been off.

524
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,073
What's going on?

525
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,587
That's what we're eager
to find out as well.

526
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,453
(inhales sharply)

527
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,747
Do you know where we might find Sooheon?

528
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,374
It seems he hasn't been at the gym either.

529
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,093
Oh, okay.

530
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,347
Hey, Chanmi, have you seen Sooheon?

531
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,140
Why can't I reach him?

532
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,517
Uh...

533
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,698
It seems you've become quite friendly
with Sooheon.

534
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,700
We're in the same class.

535
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,453
When did you start living
on the rooftop above the gym?

536
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,413
Am I not allowed to be living up there?

537
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,250
You sound a bit emotional today.

538
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,836
(sighs)

539
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,397
Are you making any progress
tracking down your brother's murderer?

540
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,506
(scoffs)

541
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,466
Are you being sarcastic?

542
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,717
(scoffs)

543
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,303
That was scary.
I don't know how to respond to that.

544
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,639
I need to go to school.

545
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,225
The police are the ones
who catch criminals.

546
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,411
If you know of anything,
or find anything suspicious,

547
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,645
come to the police.

548
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:59,232
That's the fastest way
we'll catch the killer.

549
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,315
Okay.

550
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,127
If the police had done a better job,

551
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,951
we'd probably be
in a better situation by now.

552
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,989
Good luck.

553
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,581
I don't think it's a good idea for you
to stay so close to Ji Sooheon.

554
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,046
(sighs)

555
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,559
If I don't show up again
for the next couple of days,

556
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,728
could you take care of him for me?

557
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,314
(light music)

558
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,940
(meows)

559
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,402
(sighs)

560
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,751
All rise. Bow.

561
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,461
ALL: Good morning.

562
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,254
(sighs)

563
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,340
Seok Jaebum is absent today again.

564
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,175
Is he sick?

565
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,386
- Osung, can you check on how he's doing?
- Yes, sir.

566
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,265
All right.
There are still police officers on campus.

567
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,226
Let me give you all another warning.

568
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,022
Don't make up any fake news,
and don't spread any rumors.

569
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,275
Anyways, all of us in class 4,
let's not get distracted.

570
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,445
Let's all have a good day today, yeah!

571
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,528
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

572
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,406
- Let's do this!
- STUDENT: Yes, sir.

573
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,537
Wow, even a third-generation
multimillionaire is cutting school, huh?

574
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,457
People are all the same.

575
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,334
Isn't that right?

576
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,087
Hey, are you ignoring me?

577
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,382
(sighs deeply)

578
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,306
Ok Chanmi,
your suspension is finally over.

579
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,517
Mind your manners and stay on track.

580
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,518
Yes, sir.

581
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,229
And where did Ji Sooheon go?
His cell phone is off.

582
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,414
Does anyone want to volunteer
to check up on him?

583
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,624
- Kook Jihyun does.
- Kook Jihyun does.

584
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,483
Good. Jihyun, please check on him.

585
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,710
- (laughs lightly)
- Yes, sir.

586
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,778
When will Ji Sooheon grow up?

587
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,031
Now, you are the most
valuable person in your world.

588
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,825
And the only way
to take care of yourselves

589
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,953
is to study, you guys! That's it!

590
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,832
(indistinct chatter)

591
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,587
(sighs lightly)

592
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,346
Congratulations on making it through
your suspension.

593
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,807
Why don't we try to get along
until we graduate?

594
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,018
It'll be great.
It'll be just like living in hell.

595
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,146
You might want to leave, but you can't

596
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,773
because you need to find
your brother's killer.

597
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,734
Hellish

598
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,694
school days.

599
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,069
(sighs)

600
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,766
While you were unlocking
Ji Sooheon's locker at the gym,

601
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,976
I had just arrived at the gym.

602
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,020
(breathes quickly)

603
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,188
(gasps)

604
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,984
JONGGUK: That's when I saw Ok Chanmi
running down the stairs in a hurry.

605
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,865
So what you're saying is that Ok Chanmi
took Ji Sooheon's backpack?

606
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,242
She helped the suspect,

607
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,828
who might've killed her brother,
hide his evidence?

608
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,039
That's the question on my mind as well.

609
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,208
How could she have known Ji Sooheon
was our suspect?

610
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,168
And how could she have known

611
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,837
that the backpack
was the major piece of evidence?

612
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,925
Most importantly, how could she have known
the police were on their way?

613
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:54,926
(breathes heavily)

614
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,809
How could she have opened
Ji Sooheon's locker?

615
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:57,970
I...

616
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,098
I also think that doesn't add up.

617
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,266
But that backpack seems weird.

618
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,328
There's something weird about it.
Especially at night.

619
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,520
(sighs)

620
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,942
(light music)

621
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,249
(sighs)

622
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,834
(cell phone vibrates)

623
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,941
AUTOMATED VOICE (on cell phone):
The person you dialed cannot be reached.

624
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,466

00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,565
This is where Sooheon lives.

633
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,984
Why is Chanmi here?

634
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,492
Osung, I'm sorry.

635
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,388
I know this has been a burden for you.

636
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,165
Not at all, ma'am.
Our teacher and I were just concerned.

637
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,124
(sighs)

638
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,710
Is Jaebum not answering your calls either?

639
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,879
No.

640
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,964
I think of you as my second son.

641
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:02,428
That's why I trust you and why I'm asking
for your help with this.

642
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,138
Oh, it's my pleasure, ma'am.

643
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,432
I also think of Jaebum
as a brother of mine.

644
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,435
Thank you.

645
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,192
It seems his memories
are slowly coming back to him.

646
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,443
Right.

647
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,446
The last time,
he called me from the stables at night.

648
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,907
He was asking me where he was
and he told me he was scared.

649
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,909
I wonder if that's when it started.

650
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,452
What did he tell you?

651
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,913
He didn't say anything in particular.

652
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:33,417
But after that call, I installed
a tracking app on his cell phone.

653
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,336
That's what he asked me to do.

654
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,563
Because he said himself
that he wasn't sure

655
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,427
- what kind of places he might go to.
- Then...

656
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,217
Could you check where Jaebum is right now?

657
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,932
(sighs lightly)

658
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,100
(cell phone beeps)

659
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,440
SEOK JAEBUM NEW MESSAGE

660
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,608
(sighs)

661
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,444
JAEBUM: Chanmi, are you free right now?

662
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,528
(sighs)

663
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,073
CHANMI: Yeah, sure. What's up?

664
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,658
You weren't at school.

665
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,719
JAEBUM: I came out for a walk
because I was feeling stuffy.

666
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,662
Where should I meet you?

667
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,792
CHANMI: How about the intersection
by Lucky Mall?

668
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,085
JAEBUM: Okay.

669
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,505
(sighs lightly)

670
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,099
(suspenseful music)

671
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,026
(breathes deeply)

672
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,717
THE LIFE AHEAD
LA VIE DEVANT SOI

673
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,638
(suspenseful music continues)

674
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,866
(sighs lightly)

675
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,869
Hey, isn't that man the detective?

676
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,538
(exhales deeply)

677
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,333
Tae Soyeon, do you recognize me?

678
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,062
I'm from the Special Victims Unit
at Yongtan Police Station.

679
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,962
Yes, I do.
(inhales deeply)

680
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,339
How can I help you?

681
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,299
When we looked up your phone record,

682
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,485
we found that you were the one

683
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,636
who called
and messaged Ji Sooheon the most.

684
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,471
And what's wrong with that?

685
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,597
Ji Sooheon.

686
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,183
- Do you know where he is right now?
- (scoffs)

687
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,143
How would I know that?

688
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,645
Do you have a warrant, sir?

689
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,206
You can ask simple questions
without a warrant.

690
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,790
So I guess we're not obligated
to answer simple questions, right?

691
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,859
(sighs)

692
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,588
Can you relay this message
to Ji Sooheon for me?

693
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,572
Hiding isn't always the best option.

694
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,094
If he helps us with the investigation,
his compliance will be taken into account.

695
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,536
So tell him to come out of hiding.

696
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,246
Investigation? Take that into account?

697
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,373
What is he talking about?

698
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,456
What's going on?

699
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,500
Mr. detective.

700
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,628
I have no idea
what Sooheon's being investigated for.

701
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,414
So please don't come at me
if you don't have a warrant.

702
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,629
Who do you think you are?
Showing up out of nowhere?

703
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,843
Come on, let's go.

704
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,304
- What was that all about?
- I don't know.

705
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,740
- What is this about?
- What? I don't know...

706
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,890
What?

707
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,935
- AJUNG: Hurry up.
- SOYEON: I'm hungry too.

708
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,395
(sighs)

709
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,774
What? Are you saying Ji Sooheon
was the hero that beat up Sa Junggyeong?

710
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,445
Wow, that's crazy awesome!

711
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,238
Ji Sooheon, seriously.

712
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,216
Oh, and the juvenile delinquent
from your middle school.

713
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,867
The one we met at the OBGYN clinic.

714
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,201
That bastard...

715
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,121
What's wrong with him?

716
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,057
Sooheon also beat up
that juvenile delinquent.

717
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,458
That's amazing.

718
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,376
(sighs)
He really is a true hero, isn't he?

719
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,045
Wow, seriously.
(exhales deeply)

720
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,339
- This is crazy.
- The juvenile delinquent...

721
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,383
is dead.

722
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,927
What?

723
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,887
Dead?

724
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,936
(gulping)

725
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,106
(exhales deeply)

726
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,156
Ajung.

727
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,951
I'm really sorry to ask you
to do this, but...

728
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,263
if a detective asks you
about the juvenile delinquent,

729
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,413
just say you don't know him.

730
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,391
Are you saying the police
will come after me too?

731
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,001
The detective saw your face
just a few minutes ago.

732
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,521
When he plays
the surveillance footage at the clinic,

733
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,671
he's going to recognize

734
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,757
your face.

735
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,384
I can just say I don't know him,
and that'll be it.

736
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,388
(breathes deeply)
But what's Sooheon going to do?

737
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,804
Sooheon didn't kill him.

738
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,140
Of course not.

739
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,725
He's not that type of person.

740
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,603

This is where Ji Sooheon lives.

748
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,633
Ji Sooheon?

749
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,761
Ji Sooheon lives here?

750
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:36,845
(laughs)

751
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,475
What's going on? Are all the people
ditching class all gathered here?

752
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,893
That's cute. Real cute.

753
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,395
Are you here to see Ji Sooheon?

754
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,206
Yeah, the homeroom teacher told me
to check up on him

755
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,523

Why is Ok Chanmi's name on here?

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,515
(door rattles)

760
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,599
Jaebum!

Jaebum!

762
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,063
Is Ok Chanmi in there?

763
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,274
No, she's not.

764
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,775
Ok Chanmi?

765
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,277
Isn't this place Ji Sooheon's?

766
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,904
Why are Ok Chanmi's clothes here?

767
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,531
Is she living with Ji Sooheon?

768
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,159
No, it doesn't seem like
they're living together.

769
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,285
Is Ji Sooheon inside?

770
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,286
No, he's not.

771
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,704
Then what were you doing inside?

772
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,623
I thought this was Ji Sooheon's place.

773
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,335
So Ok Chanmi is living here, right?

774
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,794
I think so.

775
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,882
What are you guys doing here anyways?

776
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,178
(sighs)

777
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,914
Your mom was worried about you
because you haven't been home.

778
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,352
She told me your location.

779
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,645
I see.

Hey, Osung, what's going on?

802

Didn't you tell me
you'd take care of Chanmi

803
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,291
in a way that would be satisfying to me?

804
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,900
What did she do to you this time?

805
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,152
Are you blind?

806
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,695
Ok Chanmi has seduced Ji Sooheon

807
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,864
and they're living together
on his rooftop.

Thank you.

Your test results don't indicate
that you've gotten any better,

826

Yes, sir.

That's what you told me last time, too.

This isn't broken.

869
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,710
It looks like
someone cut it intentionally.

870
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,045
What?

871
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,631
There's no way
the brake could've broken from wear.

872
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,549
This part here looks like an even cut.

873
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,426
Someone cut this with a knife.

874
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,680
Do you mean someone cut it on purpose?

875
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,641

00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,131
I won't die.

885
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:12,217
Instead, I'll track you down.

886
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,218
(Chanmi scoffs)

887
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,594
She's really gone mad.

888
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,096
Are you afraid?

889
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,850
Come at me, come at me now.
You crazy piece of shit!

890
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,185
Stop hiding with your bullshit.
Come out, I said!

891
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,871
I'll make sure I kick your ass. Come out!

892
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,189
- Hey, stop it, I said. Stop! Shit!
- Why? Let me go!

893
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,315
(siren blares)

894
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,028
(breathes heavily)

895
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,113
(suspenseful music)

896
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,786
(pants)

897
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,051
You should see a doctor
about your knee and wrist pain.

898
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,637
You might have after-effects,
so make sure you go see a doctor.

899
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,097
I will. Thank you.

901
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,398
Are you okay?

902
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,608
Yeah, I'm fine.

903
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,651
Do you want us to take you
to the hospital?

904
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,737
(chuckles)
No, I'll be fine.

905
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,406
I'm just going to head home
and get some rest.

906
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,074
Thanks.

00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,960
Today's Chanmi's birthday.

910
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,087
What?

911
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,090
What do you mean?

912
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,800
I mean, how do you know that?

913
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,028
Oh, because Park Wonseok's birthday
reminder has been popping up

914
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,929
on my messaging app since 3 days ago.

915
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,223
Oh.

916
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,350
They were twins, right?

917
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,899
(rattles)

918
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,279

00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,807

922
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,490
OK CHANMI

924
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,000

00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,336

INSEON: Yes?

00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,764
Hey, sweetie?

931
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,141
Oh, honey!

932
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,536
Didn't we say we were going to meet
at the main entrance?

933
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,454
Well, you know, it's been a while
since I've been in your office,

934
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,605
so I thought I'd pop in.

935
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,939
I thought you hated hospitals.

936
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,167
It's not that I wanted
to visit the hospital.

937
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,877
I just wanted to see the room
where you work.

938
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,988
Detectives and doctors have dull offices,
don't you think?

939
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,911
Um-hm. I guess we're pretty dull
as people too.

940
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,241
(laughs)
I can't argue with that.

941
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,242
Um...

942
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,344
So where are you going to take me
for lunch?

943
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,637
I'm not going to eat vegan food.

944
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,205
- Okay. Right.
- (knocking)

945
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,289
Please come in.

946
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:34,044
Oh, hey, Sooheon,
are you heading home now?

947
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,378
Yes, Doctor.

948
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,932
(sighs)

949
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,643
(slurps)

950
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,401
You've been in the hospital all this time?

951
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,654
Yes.

952
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,615
Why didn't you keep your phone on?
Your friends were worried about you.

953
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,826
I didn't want to tell them
I was in the hospital...

954
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,203
Ah.

955
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,540
Well, I guess I jumped to conclusions.

956
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,500
(inhales deeply)

957
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,418
And it goes without saying

958
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,129
that I won't tell anyone
about your illness.

959
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,009
If you're uncomfortable
talking about this,

960
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,469
of course you're free to leave.

961
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,722
No, it's fine.

962
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:30,809
(inhales deeply)

963
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,060
(sighs)

964
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,021
I'm sure we'll run into each other again,

965
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:39,025
but I'll pretend I never saw you
at the hospital.

966
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,318
(tongue clicks)

967
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,654
You're a detective.
You need to do your job.

968
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,658
Just like the doctor did his job
as a doctor.

969
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,955
This is kind of an odd thing
for me to say,

970
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,625
but, Sooheon, you're very mature.

971
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,713
I know it's also an odd thing
for me to say,

972
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,840
but, Detective,

973
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,551
I think you've married a great person.

974
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,304
My husband?

975
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:08,887
Yes.

976
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:13,101
I think Dr. Jeon is a really nice person.

977
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,604
(inhales deeply)

978
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:21,192
I never tell my husband
about my investigations.

979
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:26,489
So don't be stressed
about meeting my husband at the hospital.

980
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,824
Just focus on your treatment.

981
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,450
Yes.

982
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,077
Thank you.

983
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,538
(inhales deeply)

984
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:38,001
But I guess I don't have to say
I'm innocent while I'm here, do I?

985
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,796
No, that's not something
we need to talk about right now.

986
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:43,840
(inhales deeply)

987
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,763
If it's okay with you,
I'll be heading out now.

988
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,429
As far as I know,
we never met at the hospital.

989
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,857
(sighs deeply)

Where did the photo go?

993
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,503
(sighs)
I put it in this book.

994
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,754
(groans)

995
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,758
(knocking)

996
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,881
I guess the repair man is here
to replace the glass.

997
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,638
Yes, I'll be right there!

998
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,188
(light music)

999
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,537
What happened to the door?
And to your forehead?

1000
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,747
(breathes deeply)

1001
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,793
You're alive?

1002
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,837
What happened to you?

1003
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,381
What happened?

1004
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,966
I fell while riding my scooter.

1005
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,319
The glass was broken
because someone broke in.

1006
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,345
You should've been more careful.

1007
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,056
Was something stolen?

1008
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,224
Nothing.

1009
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,309
There's nothing worth taking.

1010
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,853
I guess it's all cool then.

1011
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,690
- What happened to you?
- Me? I'm a suspect.

1012
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,292
That's why I went silent.
To go into hiding.

1013
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,586
And you had your cell phone turned off
because you were hiding?

1014
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,863
- Right.
- (scoffs)

1015
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,924
I just turned my cell phone on
and saw that you called.

1016
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,241
Twenty-nine times.

1017
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,117
Yeah.

1018
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,079
Twenty-nine missed calls.

1019
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,081
So now, do you understand how upset I was?

1020
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,541
(laughs)

1021
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,709
Sorry.

1022
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,504
Well, it's not something
you need to apologize for.

1023
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,049
I also dealt with a lot of stress

1024
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,813
while I was alone
with my phone turned off.

1025
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,970
I'm sure you were.

1026
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,181
(inhales deeply)

1027
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,850
Hey, why don't we go
and relieve some stress together today?

1028
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,019
(both chuckle lightly)

1029
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,188
That's not a bad idea.

1030
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,772
Cool.

1031
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,792
- You're a pretty good singer.
- I thought you were way better.

1032
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,859
(laughs)

1033
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,284
(all cheer)

1034
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,245
(laughs)

1035
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:23,917
(singing)
♪ Congratulations, congratulations ♪

1036
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,962

1037
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,340
(all cheer)

1038
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,193
What are you waiting for?
The candles are melting.

1039
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,217
Ah, okay.

1040
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,094
(blows candle)

1041
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,722
(all cheer)

1042
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,700
Hey, how did you know
to put all of this together?

1043
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:40,910
How did you know it was my birthday?

1044
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,311
I knew Wonseok's birthday,

1045
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:46,081
So I and Soyeon planned to throw you
a birthday party and put it all together.

1046
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:49,442
Sooheon turned on his cell phone
just in time.

1047
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,029
Well since he had tons of missed calls,
I'm assuming he felt guilty and called me?

1048
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:57,367
I also happened to call him a lot,
and he called me back too.

1049
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,619
AJUNG: Why don't we create a club?
A missed calls club?

1050
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,496
JAEBUM: Cool! I'm all for it.

1051
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,765
- AJUNG: Sounds good, yeah?
- JAEBUM: Yes.

1052
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,166
- "Missed Calls" sounds cool.
- (Ajung laughs)

1053
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,876
JAEBUM: If it's a missed calls club,

1054
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,087
would anyone even show up
when we called them up?

1055
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,296
SOOHEON: I'll show up.

1056
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,214
(Chanmi gasps)

1057
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,799
- (all laugh)
- JAEBUM: What?

1058
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,051
(all continue laughing)

1059
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,720
(all cheer)

1060
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:18,888
AJUNG: You're cute, Soyeon.

1061
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,974
(all continue cheering)

1062
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,100
Yes, ma'am.

1063
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,186
I followed the map you sent me.

1064
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,147
It seems like Jaebum is here.

1065
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,190
Yes.

1066
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:34,195
I'll persuade him to come back home today.

1067
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,239
Don't worry too much.

1068
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,240
Yes.

1069
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,837
HIGH TEEN KARAOKE

1070
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,381
(indistinct singing)

1071
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,507
Huh.

1072
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,925
This guy's getting weird.

1073
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,468
Why is he at a karaoke?

1074
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,552
(sighs)

1075
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,889
Huh?

1076
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,268
Isn't that Ok Chanmi?

1077
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,956
- AJUNG: It's all over my face!
- JAEBUM: Uh, you...

1078
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,780
Hey, Chanmi doesn't know about this,
does she?

1079
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:11,816
AJUNG: Huh?

1080
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,779
Here.

1081
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,158
HAPPY 19th BIRTHDAY

1082
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,576
Gi Osung?

1083
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,494
Osung.

1084
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,164
- Are you here for me?
- Yeah.

1085
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,017
Are you guys celebrating
Ok Chanmi's birthday here?

1086
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,602
Yeah, I guess you must have run into her.

1087
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,644
I saw that she was on her way
to the bathroom

1088
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,854
with a bunch of cream on her face.

1089
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,338
(both chuckle)

1090
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,441
Why don't you stay and celebrate with us
since you're already here?

1091
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,591
Yeah, come join us.

1092
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,593
It's fine, I wasn't invited anyway.

1093
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,262
Jaebum, I'll be waiting for you
in the café out front.

1094
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,722
Okay, then.

1095
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,849
(cell phone ringing)

1096
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:55,693
Bye.

1097
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,111
See you.

1098
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,030
(ominous music)

1099
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,042
(closing theme music)
