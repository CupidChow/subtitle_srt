1
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:14,464
Do you know anything
about that car parked outside?

2
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:16,282
Could it be that bastard Ji Sooheon's car?

3
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,411
I can't really see their faces,

4
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:21,930
but it looks like there are two people
in the car.

5
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:23,748
- Two people?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

6
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:25,291
Ah, fuck, hold on.

7
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,293
It's a man and a woman.

8
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:31,425
Wow, fuck.
They're about to have sex in the car.

9
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:33,716
Then chase them off.

10
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,819
That way, Ji Sooheon can approach
without suspecting anything.

11
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:37,678
Gotcha. I'm going to hang up for now.

12
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:39,722
What the fuck.

13
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:42,245
Why do they have to do that
in front of someone's house? Fuck.

14
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:54,309
Ugh, why do these fuckers
have to mess around over here?

15
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,361
Hey!

16
00:01:57,948 --> 00:01:59,116
Leave.

17
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:07,083
Crazy bastards, shit.

18
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,148
Damn it.

19
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,401
Ji Sooheon, you bastard.

20
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:18,445
I caught your ass today.

21
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:34,962
REVENGE OF OTHERS

22
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:44,722
ONE DAY EARLIER

23
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:47,266
PILSUNG EXPRESS

24
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,944
Hello.

25
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,405
Do you remember me?

26
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,616
Oh, of course, of course.

27
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,910
Oh, but, what brings you here today?

28
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:11,081
I have something to tell you.

29
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,168
We'll do it.

30
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,969
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL

31
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,603
ICU VISITOR WAITING ROOM

32
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:20,401
Thanks.

33
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,002
What brings you here this early?

34
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:40,170
How's your mother doing?

35
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,592
She's the same.

36
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:46,760
Sooheon.

37
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:48,846
I just got back
from meeting Min Seonha's dad

38
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:51,169
at the shipping center,
where he works as a delivery man.

39
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,851
I know you need money fast.

40
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,061
Min Seonha's dad has made another request.

41
00:05:57,313 --> 00:06:00,399
I guess that bastard Sa Junggyeong
is harassing Min Seonha again.

42
00:06:00,691 --> 00:06:01,859
He's such a dirtbag.

43
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:18,125
I'll do it.

44
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:22,504
This is dangerous,

45
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:25,049
so stay out of this, Ajung.

46
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:27,009
I'll be fine.

47
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:28,802
But I haven't told Tae Soyeon about this.

48
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,476
I guess I better head to school.

49
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:38,520
I'll see you there, Sooheon.

50
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:57,122
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL

51
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:01,126
Ajung, Hong Ajung...

52
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:25,818
WHITE CIDER

53
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,489
I was pretty thirsty.

54
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:33,242
So I drank two.

55
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,202
Ah.

56
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,874
- Did you stay at the hospital all night?
- Yeah.

57
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,418
Isn't that my bag?

58
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:43,752
Yeah.

59
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:45,212
Your uniform's in here.

60
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:51,260
I know how you must be feeling,

61
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:54,223
but you should take care of yourself
so that you can look after your m...

62
00:07:57,307 --> 00:07:58,517
Never mind.

63
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:01,145
Let's eat first.

64
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:05,566
Let's go eat.

65
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:20,873
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL

66
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:23,333
Let's eat.

67
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,219
You didn't have to come
all the way out here.

68
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:36,096
There's nothing for you to do here.

69
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:38,432
Look at you.

70
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:41,624
You're not eating anything,
so I'm here to make sure you eat.

71
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:43,645
And what about school?

72
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,189
You should be going to school.

73
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,362
I know I should be minding
my own business,

74
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:54,907
but I'm just so worried about you.

75
00:08:57,743 --> 00:08:58,827
Sooheon.

76
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:02,039
You need to stay healthy
and live a normal life

77
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:04,249
in order to take care of your mom, right?

78
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:08,504
I'm healthy and I'm living a normal life.

79
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:11,223
Do you really think
this is normal right now?

80
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:15,427
If everything was normal,
why would I be here this morning?

81
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:17,596
Also...

82
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,354
Why did you hide the fact
that Ajung was here earlier?

83
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,150
Why would I hide something like that?

84
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:35,173
Am I supposed to be reporting to you
about every person that stopped by?

85
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:36,365
Eh...

86
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,410
I'm sorry that I said
you were hiding things.

87
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:44,289
But is it so wrong for me to ask?

88
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:45,958
You're pretty busy yourself.

89
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,794
Don't you have a lot
on your plate right now?

90
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:52,798
So are you saying
I should stop looking out for you?

91
00:10:09,273 --> 00:10:11,191
These were inside Gi Osung's desk drawer.

92
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:12,943
The drawer was locked.

93
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,826
If they used to hang out together
like that,

94
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:23,912
it probably means they were pretty close.

95
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,416
Judging from everything so far,

96
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:29,626
it's pretty clear that Gi Osung
is the culprit.

97
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:32,713
But we'll have to delve deeper

98
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:34,172
to find out what really happened

99
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:36,592
between these four guys.

100
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,304
Jaebum definitely knew my brother.

101
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:44,099
He just can't remember is all.

102
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:46,184
Gwon Sejin hung out with them too.

103
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:55,277
Anyways, I'll look into this.

104
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,112
Just focus on looking after your mom.

105
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:20,695
- What were you doing in my room, bastard?
- Why would I go into your room?

106
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,012
Answer me! What did you do?

107
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:29,478
Ji Sooheon.

108
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:31,813
So you rifled through my drawers
and took my photos?

109
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:35,692
Ji Sooheon, you're really...

110
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:38,737
I guess I can't keep you alive.

111
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:46,929
Someone wants to have a word with you
before you head out for school.

112
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:48,080
With who?

113
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,415
Who else in this house
would want to speak with you?

114
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,883
Oh, come on in.

115
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:08,809
Why aren't you having breakfast?

116
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,227
I'm not hungry.

117
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:16,191
Don't worry too much about your arrest
and the police investigation.

118
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,555
Everything's okay as long
as you didn't do anything wrong.

119
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,237
I didn't do anything.

120
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:23,163
You're the one who made it worse
by hiding it.

121
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:25,242
You're right.

122
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:27,244
I should have thought it through
more carefully.

123
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:29,371
If this is about the murder,

124
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:31,456
I haven't done anything, so don't worry.

125
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,501
I'll be on my way to school.

126
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:35,669
Osung.

127
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:38,505
Sit down for a minute.

128
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:43,552
I...

129
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,762
Heard from Jihyun at breakfast

130
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:49,641
that when Detective Jin came
to the house yesterday

131
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:53,311
you were fighting with a boy
from Jihyun's class?

132
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:55,981
It was nothing.

133
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:59,025
I'm just not on very good terms
with him is all.

134
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:00,586
So do you always get into physical fights

135
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,505
when you're not on good terms
with someone, especially at home?

136
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,589
He came into my room
and rifled through my things.

137
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:04,674
Isn't that reason enough to get mad?

138
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:05,949
He rifled through your room?

139
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,160
What's his name?

140
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,454
I asked you what his name is.

141
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:12,581
It's Ji Sooheon.

142
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:14,207
Ji Sooheon.

143
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,211
Why would Ji Sooheon
rifle through your room?

144
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,381
He's just that kind of a person.

145
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:22,859
I don't understand
why Kook Jihyun likes him so much

146
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:24,843
as to invite him over to our house.

147
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:25,844
I don't get it.

148
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:27,971
By any chance, are you and Ji Sooheon

149
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:30,390
involved in this murder case?

150
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:31,474
What?

151
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,311
Why would we be involved
with the murder case?

152
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:35,729
We're not.

153
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:39,024
I mean, why was your study café receipt
left behind at the crime scene?

154
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:42,194
Since you wouldn't have been
at the crime scene,

155
00:13:42,277 --> 00:13:45,655
I'm asking if Ji Sooheon would have had
anything to do with that receipt.

156
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:48,200
I don't know... anything about that.

157
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:54,331
Anyways, the killer intentionally left

158
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:57,042
your study café receipt
at the murder scene.

159
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,960
That's the fact.

160
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:02,589
They're trying to frame you
as the murderer.

161
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:04,298
So...

162
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:06,885
what should I do?

163
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,094
We need to catch the killer.

164
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:11,306
We need to find the guy
who's trying to frame you,

165
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:14,643
so that they can't hurt you anymore.
We need to find them quickly.

166
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:16,019
As for you, Osung...

167
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:18,456
don't worry about this investigation
and just focus on your studies.

168
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,731
Do you understand me?

169
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:21,191
Yes, Dad.

170
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:23,026
Okay, you can go now.

171
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:50,554
How are you, Mr. Choi?

172
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,597
Oh, hey, I'm doing well, Chanmi.

173
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,182
You're working early today.

174
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:56,643
I had an appointment with a customer.

175
00:14:58,603 --> 00:14:59,604
Where's Sooheon?

176
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:01,690
I don't know.

177
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:04,282
He must be at the hospital
because of his mom.

178
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:06,208
That's really a lot for him to deal with.

179
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:08,071
- Mr. Choi...
- Yeah?

180
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:10,365
Can I ask you for a favor?

181
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,492
Sure. What is it?

182
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:15,662
I was wondering if you could sell
this scooter for me.

183
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,390
I guess you're probably
not going to replace it.

184
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:19,809
- Are you not going to ride one anymore?
- Yeah, I'm not going to ride it anymore.

185
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,545
- Do you know how to prepare the documents?
- Yes, I put the documents under the seat.

186
00:15:23,628 --> 00:15:26,548
Did you now?
You must be serious about selling it then?

187
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:30,176
Mr. Choi, please make sure
you sell it at a high price.

188
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:33,555
Are you in desperate need of money?

189
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:34,973
Thank you.

190
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,517
About Ji Sooheon.

191
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:21,353
I've come up
with a plan to get rid of him.

192
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,105
A plan? What good is a plan?

193
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:26,349
You just have to grab him
and beat the shit out of him.

194
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,945
My cousin and his friends
are going to beat him to a pulp.

195
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:30,946
Isn't that enough?

196
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,673
We can't be the ones
to lay our hands on him first.

197
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:34,699
That's why I asked to meet up.

198
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:36,701
Why can't we lay our hands on him?

199
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:38,930
I'm telling you. I'm going to kill the guy
who did this to my foot.

200
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,413
You don't have any evidence.

201
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:42,183
What are you going to do if he says
he's not the one who did this to you?

202
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:44,518
Once we beat the shit out of him,
he'll probably beg for mercy.

203
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:47,420
If you beat the shit out of him,
you'll end up in jail.

204
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:49,798
Aren't you on probation

205
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:51,633
for assaulting Min Seonha?

206
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:54,481
You'll definitely end up
in jail this time.

207
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:58,223
So what do you suggest we do?

208
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,601
Let's set a trap.

209
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:04,604
That bastard Ji Sooheon
will crawl right into it.

210
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:06,928
And once he's in,
it'll snap around his ankles like this.

211
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,026
He'll be stuck and won't be able
to make a move.

212
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:13,571
So how do you want to set up the trap?

213
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:15,216
I heard you've been putting pressure
on Min Seonha recently. Is that true?

214
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,408
Yeah.

215
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:17,951
Min Seonha must know.

216
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:21,204
She probably asked someone
to turn me into this shriveled mess.

217
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:24,123
That's why I've been
pressuring Min Seonha lately.

218
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:25,725
Just keep doing what you've been doing.

219
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:27,544
And don't do anything else.

220
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,547
Don't go anywhere near Ji Sooheon.

221
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:34,300
That way, he'll have zero idea
we're onto him.

222
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:35,384
On the flip side,

223
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:40,175
you do realize that we definitely need
to kill that bastard Ji Sooheon, right?

224
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,990
What's your deal?

225
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:58,867
Are you a pervert? Or a thief?

226
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:00,994
Maybe you're both?

227
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:03,723
A perverted thief who broke
into my drawer and stole my photos?

228
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:05,307
I don't know what you're talking about.

229
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,810
Just leave
if you're going to talk bullshit.

230
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:08,668
Hey.

231
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:10,021
You and I clearly both know
what's going on.

232
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,689
Don't you feel embarrassed
lying like this?

233
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:13,923
You took my pictures, polaroid's.

234
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:16,288
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You took them.

235
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:20,388
Did you go crazy
after your visit to the police station?

236
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:22,324
I already told you it wasn't me.
Why do you keep talking shit?

237
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,559
Who do you think made me get arrested?

238
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:28,188
It was you. You, bastard.
Why are you playing dumb?

239
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:30,982
You framed me.

240
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,276
Wow, this bastard's really lost his mind.

241
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,945
Hey, look me in the eyes and tell me.

242
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:39,449
You were at the body shop.

243
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,368
For that bastard's murder. Weren't you?

244
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:43,870
You're crazy, aren't you?

245
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:46,621
How can you be so confident
with all this bullshit?

246
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:50,627
Okay.

247
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:54,089
Let's see how long you can keep up
with this lie.

248
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,633
I'm curious too.

249
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,177
How long can you keep up
with this bullshit?

250
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,054
Give me back my photos, you bastard.

251
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:03,282
How can I give back something
I don't have, you piece of shit?

252
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,433
If you're frustrated,
you can go find them yourself.

253
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,395
Once I find the evidence,

254
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:11,815
that'll be the end of you.

255
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:15,318
Like you said, as soon I find evidence,

256
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:17,362
your life's going to end.

257
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:21,074
This guy.

258
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:25,662
I don't have time for you right now.

259
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:29,207
So if you want to talk more shit,
just do it in front of a mirror, okay?

260
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:31,435
You'll see a pretty revolting bastard
standing before you,

261
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:33,044
even by your standards.

262
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:40,687
Let's see if you can keep talking that way
when you're in handcuffs.

263
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Huh?

264
00:19:41,928 --> 00:19:43,429
We'll definitely see about that.

265
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:51,646
What did you want to talk about?

266
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,857
Oh.

267
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:55,942
I wanted to ask you something.

268
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,193
Yeah.

269
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:05,201
Can you teach me how to drive a car?

270
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:06,577
Drive?

271
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:09,164
Of course I can teach you.

272
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:10,540
Do you want to get a license?

273
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,459
Yeah, I want to get my license.

274
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:14,961
In that case,

275
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:17,422
I'll guess I'll need to get a hold
of a practice car.

276
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,511
And a place
where we can comfortably practice...

277
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:25,388
What's this?

278
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,764
Can you take a look at this?

279
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,018
Is there anything you...

280
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:31,603
I mean...

281
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,479
Can you tell me anything about it?

282
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:34,731
About this photo.

283
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:36,649
Ah, I'm sorry.

284
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:39,402
You know I don't remember much.

285
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:43,907
Isn't this Park Wonseok?

286
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,241
A few days ago,

287
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,244
Osung showed me a polaroid like this.

288
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:51,122
One of me and Park Wonseok.

289
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:53,833
I have no idea who this guy is.

290
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,001
Gwon Sejin.

291
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:57,921
He was close to my brother.

292
00:20:58,004 --> 00:20:59,255
He plays the violin.

293
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:20,276
Actually, what I wanted to ask you is...

294
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,655
Why is Gi Osung in the photo?

295
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:26,741
Based on the photo,
it seems you were all really close.

296
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:30,262
I just can't believe that my brother
and Gi Osung were close.

297
00:21:30,286 --> 00:21:31,704
Something about it seems weird.

298
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:36,251
That was why I asked, just in case.

299
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,169
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:41,005
Ah, it's okay.

301
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:43,341
By the way,

302
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,635
where did you get this photo?

303
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,179
Uh...

304
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:50,181
Someone gave it to me.

305
00:21:51,808 --> 00:21:53,935
I can't let you know who, but...

306
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:55,103
Oh.

307
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,273
Oh, right.

308
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:00,525
Your driving lesson starts tomorrow.

309
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,038
<i>I'll see you for our next class.</i>

310
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,730
(NEW POST SHARE
SOUNDS STUPID:)

311
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:40,606
Osung, what's going on?

312
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:44,610
With what? Jaebum, can we talk later?

313
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:46,404
I just created an Insta account.

314
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:48,156
SHARE
YOUR POST IS SUCCESSFULLY UPLOADED

315
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:50,450
Why didn't you show me all the photos?

316
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,330
Why did you show me only
the one of me and Park Wonseok?

317
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:57,707
There was another one with you

318
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,792
and there was another guy in there too,
Gwon Sejin?

319
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:03,129
Why did you only show me
the photo of me and Park Wonseok?

320
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,130
Jaebum.

321
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:08,301
I don't know what you're talking about,
but let's talk later.

322
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:09,969
I'm kinda busy right now.

323
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:28,780
Hey, Jihyun.

324
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:31,032
I'm busy right now.

325
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:33,034
Check this out.

326
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:36,954
What's this?

327
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:38,206
Who took this?

328
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,049
Looks like Gi Osung
created an Insta account.

329
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,834
He uploaded a lot of fun photos.

330
00:23:43,753 --> 00:23:45,296
Ah...

331
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:48,132
fivestars_GI MY HOME LIKE 65

332
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:50,676
Wow, he's driving me insane.
He's finally lost his mind.

333
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,470
Oh, it's kinda funny though.

334
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:54,430
A lot of people are liking his posts.

335
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:58,142
- I'm following his account too.
- Ugh, this attention whore.

336
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:00,996
I was wondering why he didn't have
an Instagram account until now. Ugh.

337
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,481
He even posted practice
questions for the upcoming midterm.

338
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:05,751
He also posted a map
of favorite hang-out spots for bullies.

339
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:07,294
He's racking up a lot of followers
in a short amount of time.

340
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:10,446
- It's pretty popular.
- Popular, my ass.

341
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:17,829
Soyeon, Gi Osung opened up
an Instagram account.

342
00:24:18,746 --> 00:24:20,498
A lot of his posts are about Kook Jihyun.

343
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:22,875
What a pathetic loser.

344
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,128
I'm going to follow him anyways.

345
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:26,879
- I'm curious.
- Okay.

346
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:28,774
- Me too, me too, me too.
- Wow, this is pretty good.

347
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,049
Huh? Hey, this is...

348
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:31,610
I posted it on my Instagram,
so you can check it out.

349
00:24:31,634 --> 00:24:33,970
Can you post more practice questions?

350
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:36,782
Wow, are you posting for free
what you get from your expensive tutors?

351
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:39,934
Don't worry. I'll pick
the most helpful ones and post them.

352
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:40,935
Wow, so lucky!

353
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:41,853
- Really?
- Hey, me too! Me too!

354
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:43,696
- Let's go.
- All right, I'll send it to you.

355
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:47,108
Hey, Gi Osung.

356
00:24:47,191 --> 00:24:49,068
Your Insta's pretty fun, huh?

357
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,028
Hey, post more photos of Jihyun.

358
00:24:51,112 --> 00:24:52,697
Okay, don't worry. I got you.

359
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,657
I'm going to post
at least five of her a day.

360
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,784
Five? Oh yeah!

361
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:00,830
What "Oh yeah"?

362
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,593
So what are you going to do
with my photos?

363
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:12,091
Instagram?

364
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:13,485
So after all that,
now you're going to sell my photos?

365
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:14,802
Just because we live together?

366
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:16,429
How could you say it like that?

367
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:17,597
Everyone likes them anyway.

368
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,515
Delete them while I'm asking nicely.

369
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,976
I can't really delete them right now.

370
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,739
Can you hold on
for like two or three days?

371
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:26,647
- Two or three days?
- Yeah, I think that'll be enough time.

372
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:28,733
Are you planning something right now?

373
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:30,234
What are you plotting?

374
00:25:31,652 --> 00:25:32,880
Come on, plotting?
I'm not plotting anything.

375
00:25:32,904 --> 00:25:34,584
I just wanted to try out Instagram is all.

376
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:36,651
Why after two or three days?

377
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:40,179
Is something going to end
after two or three days have passed?

378
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:41,579
It just means

379
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:43,348
I'll have them up for a bit,
then take them down.

380
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:45,017
Why did you take photos of me
without telling me?

381
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,041
Huh?

382
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:48,544
It was all just a joke, you know.

383
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:49,754
How many have you taken?

384
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:51,589
Tell me how many you took.

385
00:25:51,672 --> 00:25:52,840
Not that many.

386
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:54,568
It was just for fun.
How many could I have possibly taken?

387
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:55,592
That's all of it.

388
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,863
Didn't you tell him
you're going to upload five a day?

389
00:25:57,887 --> 00:25:59,263
I mean, I was just throwing bait.

390
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:00,532
You've got to throw some bait
to reel in the followers

391
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:02,242
- within a short period of time...
- Anyways.

392
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:04,018
Delete the posts while I'm here right now

393
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:05,454
and delete the ones
that are saved on your phone.

394
00:26:05,478 --> 00:26:06,646
Give me your cell phone.

395
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:11,691
Hey...

396
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:20,660
I... I'm sorry.

397
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:22,721
It'll be over in two or three days,
and I'll delete them all after that.

398
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:23,871
Sorry.

399
00:26:30,503 --> 00:26:32,630
Screw that asshole.

400
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:36,092
Ugh, what in the world is he plotting?

401
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:47,979
Enjoy.

402
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,610
What?

403
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:58,322
You think I'm going to kill you?

404
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:00,533
I... I deserve to die, detective.

405
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,410
Do you cut your noodles?

406
00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:04,120
Yes, four times.

407
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:05,413
Ugh, seriously.

408
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:09,041
I would cut you like this
if I could have it my way.

409
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:13,921
I'm sorry. It won't ever happen again.

410
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:18,551
If we're to do our jobs,
let's do it right, yeah?

411
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:21,137
Kin, networks, alumni, neighbors.

412
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,848
You've got to cut all ties
that could hinder your investigation.

413
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:25,891
I'll keep that in mind.

414
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:28,686
If I ever catch you hiding evidence

415
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:30,706
and reporting to the higher-ups
without reporting to me,

416
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,690
this, this is how you'll end up.

417
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:33,608
Yes ma'am!

418
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,777
Detective Jin, I got a hold of a video.

419
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:37,861
What video?

420
00:27:38,237 --> 00:27:39,739
For the body shop case.

421
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:42,634
We've already checked
all security footage,

422
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:44,595
and there's nothing else
we haven't collected. We've seen it all.

423
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:46,454
And you're still saying
there's another video?

424
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:47,913
This video is totally different.

425
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:49,373
Where was this taken from?

426
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:50,958
From the roof of the body shop.

427
00:27:51,876 --> 00:27:53,753
- The roof?
- Yes, ma'am.

428
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:57,715
Let's go, follow me.

429
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:00,217
Excuse me? I haven't eaten yet...

430
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,681
So this is the back door of the body shop.

431
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:08,351
And a drone captured
the suspect coming out the back door.

432
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:10,061
So this means there was an accomplice.

433
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:15,751
It seems like it might be an accomplice,
but there's something strange about it.

434
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:17,777
They left through different routes,

435
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,421
and there's a time gap
between their exits.

436
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:21,572
One left through the front door,

437
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:24,617
and the other left through
the back door 10 to 15 minutes later.

438
00:28:25,117 --> 00:28:27,536
It never occurred to me
that it could've been two people.

439
00:28:28,537 --> 00:28:30,641
There was no car
or any security cameras by the back door,

440
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:33,250
so we couldn't have known this.

441
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:36,045
Oh, by the way,
how did you get a hold of this?

442
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,632
<i>I was wondering
if there was anything else I could find,</i>

443
00:28:39,715 --> 00:28:42,235
<i>so I went back to the crime scene
before coming into work today.</i>

444
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:46,180
<i>And I saw a strange guy there.</i>

445
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:47,973
Look here!

446
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:52,395
What are you doing over there?

447
00:28:52,478 --> 00:28:53,771
Come down!

448
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:56,899
Come down from there, quickly!

449
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:58,234
<i>Who was he?</i>

450
00:29:00,861 --> 00:29:03,322
Cho Dohyun, Male, 27 years old.

451
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:05,467
<i>He recently graduated from college,
currently unemployed.</i>

452
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:07,171
<i>And his hobby is playing with his drone.</i>

453
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:09,620
Come on, move your butt
out of the way, man. I can't see!

454
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:10,579
I can see now! I can see!

455
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:11,943
<i>If I were to be more specific...</i>

456
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:13,392
<i>his hobby is to secretly
record apartment buildings</i>

457
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,251
<i>or motels at night.</i>

458
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:17,545
<i>And to record sexual intercourse
or nude scenes.</i>

459
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:18,879
He's a pervert.

460
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:21,424
On the night of the murder,

461
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:23,968
<i>He was enjoying his perverted hobby...</i>

462
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:25,970
<i>when his drone broke
and fell somewhere.</i>

463
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:27,221
I'm fucked.

464
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:37,481
<i>When he followed the GPS on his drone,</i>

465
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:40,085
<i>He found out it had crash landed
onto the roof of the body shop.</i>

466
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:47,199
<i>So he thought he would come back
the next day when it was bright out.</i>

467
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:49,618
<i>The next morning,
when he came back to the body shop,</i>

468
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:51,370
<i>there was a police line set up.</i>

469
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,707
<i>He couldn't get past the police line
to retrieve his drone,</i>

470
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,059
<i>so he was hanging around the place.</i>

471
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,793
That's when I found him today.

472
00:29:58,878 --> 00:30:00,355
After retrieving the drone from the roof,

473
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:02,149
I checked the drone's recordings
just in case.

474
00:30:02,173 --> 00:30:03,507
There was a lot of porn.

475
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:05,342
Then at the end, this came on.

476
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:07,178
Jongguk.

477
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:09,804
Good job.

478
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:11,849
That pervert was just so gross

479
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:13,392
that I charged him for violating

480
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:15,853
the Special Act on the Punishment
of Sexual Violence Crimes.

481
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:17,145
Got it.

482
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:43,214
Seonha, you're late.

483
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:47,760
You should've come right after school,
you fucking whore.

484
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,554
Fuck, how could you make me wait?

485
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:52,632
Why are you doing this to me?

486
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:54,767
I told you I don't know anything.

487
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,935
Aww, shit.

488
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:57,579
What do you mean you don't know anything?

489
00:30:57,603 --> 00:31:00,763
If you don't even know who did this to me,
who else would know, you crazy bitch?

490
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:02,953
Tell me quickly
before I actually kill you.

491
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:05,069
Who did you ask to do this to me?

492
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:07,947
Hurry up and tell me, you fucking bitch!

493
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,365
Huh?

494
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:12,701
Hey, I said hurry up and tell me!

495
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:15,496
Who was the asshole
you asked to do this? Shit!

496
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:19,208
Fuck. I'll be back tomorrow, Seonha.

497
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,043
Got it?

498
00:31:27,383 --> 00:31:31,470
YONGTAN HIGH

499
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:40,521
Hey! Hey, what the... What are you doing?

500
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:44,316
What the...

501
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,860
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

502
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:47,027
I'm fine.

503
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:52,366
Hey, what are you doing right now, huh?

504
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:58,289
Apologize to her.

505
00:31:58,706 --> 00:31:59,832
Jaebum.

506
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:02,939
It's really not a good idea
for you to get close to Ok Chanmi.

507
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:16,932
Are you all right?

508
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:18,016
Yeah.

509
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:34,158
Dad, I'm sorry.

510
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:35,576
No, you shouldn't be, Seonha.

511
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:37,494
There's nothing for you to be sorry about.

512
00:32:37,578 --> 00:32:40,080
I mean, you've done nothing wrong.

513
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:43,584
Dad, can I...

514
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:46,921
Can I transfer to a school far away,
where no one knows me?

515
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:49,858
I mean, why should you have to transfer
when you haven't done anything wrong?

516
00:32:49,882 --> 00:32:51,759
Just wait it out, Seonha.

517
00:32:51,842 --> 00:32:54,094
He said he'll come back tomorrow.

518
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:58,515
That devil Sa Junggyeong told me
he'll even come to our house tomorrow.

519
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,645
I really don't know what to do.

520
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:06,023
I wish I could kill him.

521
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:10,527
Seon... Seonha, listen to me.

522
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:14,323
I've made another re-request.

523
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:17,159
This time, he might actually kill him.

524
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,580
I mean, I didn't actually mean

525
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:24,083
that he'd kill Sa Junggyeong for real.

526
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:27,419
I meant that he'll punish him
till he's nearly dead.

527
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,923
Nearly dead, so that he won't ever dare
to approach us, ever again.

528
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:33,509
- Is that true, Dad?
- Of course.

529
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:37,680
I... I've made another request to him.

530
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:40,140
So don't worry, Seonha.

531
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:44,228
Soon, that wretched bastard Sa Junggyeong

532
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,815
will be gone forever.

533
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:49,733
Is that really going to happen?

534
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:51,110
Yes, Seonha.

535
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:52,993
He'll definitely be punished
this time around.

536
00:33:53,862 --> 00:33:56,262
To the point where he won't even be able
to have his chin up.

537
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:07,251
I just can't stand it anymore, Dad.

538
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:16,635
It's okay. It's okay.

539
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,852
YOUNGSTRONG TIRE

540
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:02,930
You're here.

541
00:35:04,183 --> 00:35:05,350
Hey, Sa Junggyeong.

542
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:07,620
At the soonest, it'll be tomorrow
or the day after that.

543
00:35:07,644 --> 00:35:09,104
Ji Sooheon's going to attack you.

544
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:10,188
What?

545
00:35:11,982 --> 00:35:13,692
Hey, are you sure about that?

546
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:16,096
I heard it at the convenience store
near Min Seonha's home.

547
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:18,642
I heard what Min Seonha
and her father were talking about.

548
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:21,742
Last time,
it was the photography dark room,

549
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:23,118
so where will it be this time?

550
00:35:23,202 --> 00:35:24,846
Will it be at the school
I've transferred to?

551
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,038
Or maybe on the street?

552
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:28,016
What the fuck? How can I be prepared
if I don't know where he'll assault me?

553
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,792
The hunter decides where he'll hunt.

554
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,044
That's why it's called a trap.

555
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:33,212
So where will it be?

556
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:35,005
At the RV park you're currently living in.

557
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:44,306
That bastard Ji Sooheon will follow you

558
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:46,225
to try and find a place to attack you.

559
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:49,561
Where else would you be alone at night?

560
00:35:50,312 --> 00:35:51,355
The RV park.

561
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:54,942
That's the perfect place to attack you.

562
00:35:56,777 --> 00:35:59,029
Then my cousin
and his friends can hide near the RV

563
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:02,258
and once that bastard Ji Sooheon shows up,
they'll attack him and crush his toes.

564
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:03,617
They can pop all his teeth out.

565
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:05,327
- Am I right?
- No.

566
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:07,931
No matter what, you can't beat him up.

567
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:11,376
Your cousin and his friends
can't show up either.

568
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:13,585
Instead...

569
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:17,232
Sa Junggyeong, you're going to have
to take the beating.

570
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:19,133
What?

571
00:36:19,716 --> 00:36:21,218
I have to get beaten up again?

572
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:24,096
Are you out of your mind? Seriously.
Hey, you bastard.

573
00:36:24,805 --> 00:36:27,086
Do you think what you're saying
makes any sense right now?

574
00:36:38,193 --> 00:36:40,070
Damn.

575
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:44,116
Don't go home
after your class ends tomorrow.

576
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:46,326
What I mean is...

577
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:49,121
don't go back to the RV.

578
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:52,207
Okay.

579
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:16,398
SEOUL

580
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:13,330
Excuse me.

581
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:15,040
Slightly to the left.

582
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,750
Like this?

583
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,335
No, that's too much.

584
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,176
Yes, I think that's good.

585
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:29,179
I think we have to turn it
slightly more to this side.

586
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:30,430
Here?

587
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:32,933
A bit more.

588
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:35,394
- How's this?
- A little more.

589
00:38:37,604 --> 00:38:38,647
How's that?

590
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,232
Yes, that's good.

591
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:43,694
Damn, this kid thinks he's my boss now?

592
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:14,766
CAMERA_03

593
00:39:33,493 --> 00:39:34,745
Ji Sooheon.

594
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:38,790
You're dead.

595
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:51,928
I need to apologize.

596
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:53,221
I really owe you an apology.

597
00:39:53,305 --> 00:39:56,350
Are you telling me to drive
this car right now?

598
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:59,853
This car? Even I can recognize
how big and expensive it is.

599
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:03,023
Sorry, I couldn't find a practice car.

600
00:40:03,982 --> 00:40:06,234
- All cars are the same.
- Uh, hold on. Hold on.

601
00:40:07,778 --> 00:40:10,280
For today, let's just practice driving
slowly and braking.

602
00:40:11,114 --> 00:40:14,076
I'm sorry, I don't think I can do it.
Can we just go, please?

603
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,219
If you can't do it now,
you'll be traumatized

604
00:40:15,243 --> 00:40:16,763
and never be able to drive again
in the future.

605
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:17,907
Come on, let's switch seats.

606
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:25,212
Come on.

607
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:26,421
Let's just practice braking.

608
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:34,596
Now, step on the brake.

609
00:40:36,973 --> 00:40:38,683
- It's fine.
- Okay.

610
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:39,767
Again.

611
00:40:40,227 --> 00:40:42,104
Slowly, just do it slowly.

612
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:46,942
Now, brake.

613
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,238
Ah, sorry.

614
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:52,823
It's okay. You're doing great.

615
00:40:52,906 --> 00:40:55,575
Don't step on the break so suddenly.
Do it gradually.

616
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:58,412
Try to remember how it feels on your feet.

617
00:40:58,495 --> 00:40:59,871
- Okay.
- Try that again.

618
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:05,085
There you go.
Keep your foot on the accelerator, slowly.

619
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,045
There you go.

620
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:08,463
Keep going.

621
00:41:08,922 --> 00:41:10,632
Now, the brake, slowly.

622
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:15,554
Oh, good job.

623
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:16,847
That's it.

624
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:20,243
Keep your foot on the brake
and move the gear to P to park.

625
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:23,520
- P to park.
- There you go

626
00:41:25,355 --> 00:41:26,481
Wow, my hands are shaking.

627
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:29,359
Let's go again.
Move the gear to D to start again.

628
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:30,735
Huh? So soon?

629
00:41:34,072 --> 00:41:35,072
What?

630
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,783
Sorry.

631
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:39,703
I just remembered when you first taught me
how to hold a firing pose.

632
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:41,663
Remember what you told me?

633
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:43,957
Hold your gun out. Relax your shoulders.

634
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,250
Keep your chin tucked.

635
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:47,794
Put it down. Hold your gun out.

636
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:50,422
Stop lying.
When did I ever tell you to do that?

637
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:51,505
You did!

638
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:53,675
Wow, see? Only the victim remembers.

639
00:41:55,427 --> 00:41:57,721
So move your gear back
to D to drive and start.

640
00:41:58,847 --> 00:41:59,847
Huh?

641
00:42:00,265 --> 00:42:01,433
Start.

642
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:02,809
Move the gear to D.

643
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:04,478
D.

644
00:42:15,614 --> 00:42:17,282
Tell me the truth.

645
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:19,618
Why are you trying to learn
how to drive all of a sudden?

646
00:42:20,785 --> 00:42:21,785
Why?

647
00:42:22,704 --> 00:42:24,104
Is there something wrong with that?

648
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:25,957
It just felt abrupt.

649
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,521
It's the middle of the semester,
and we're not even on a break.

650
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:31,796
Do you want the truth?

651
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:33,506
Yeah.

652
00:42:36,343 --> 00:42:39,679
I'm going to drive my brother's murderer
to the mountains and bury them.

653
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:44,706
Soon, I'm going to catch the culprit

654
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:48,688
who killed my brother.

655
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:53,568
I'm going to ask the killer
why they did it.

656
00:42:53,652 --> 00:42:56,321
And I'm going to get
an apology out of them.

657
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:01,660
If I can't forgive them even then,
I'm going to kill them.

658
00:43:03,703 --> 00:43:05,664
I figured I'd probably need a car
for that.

659
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,707
So, am I...

660
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,335
your accomplice?

661
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:12,337
You're not an accomplice.

662
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,380
All you did was teach me how to drive.
That doesn't make you an accomplice.

663
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:17,759
But now I know all about your plan.

664
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:20,123
Then why don't you go
to the police station and report me?

665
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:25,892
I guess I don't have a choice then.

666
00:43:29,521 --> 00:43:31,201
I guess I'll have to tell you
a secret too.

667
00:43:32,065 --> 00:43:33,108
A secret?

668
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:40,115
What did it feel like for you

669
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:44,047
when your twin disappeared
from this world?

670
00:43:46,621 --> 00:43:47,872
That came out of nowhere.

671
00:43:52,836 --> 00:43:54,254
I was a twin too.

672
00:43:57,549 --> 00:43:58,800
Are you serious?

673
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:00,051
Really.

674
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:03,346
When I was 14,

675
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,540
during the summer vacation
of my first year in middle school,

676
00:44:08,893 --> 00:44:10,103
he suddenly died.

677
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:15,774
He was

678
00:44:16,943 --> 00:44:17,943
the younger twin.

679
00:44:20,905 --> 00:44:22,198
He was sick.

680
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:24,701
He had a bad heart.

681
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:28,830
He suddenly died of a heart attack.

682
00:44:33,335 --> 00:44:35,003
We looked exactly the same.

683
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,008
Only my family could tell us apart.

684
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:42,677
That's how similar we looked.

685
00:44:49,142 --> 00:44:50,560
After my younger brother died,

686
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:54,939
it was really weird for about a year.

687
00:44:57,525 --> 00:44:58,943
Whenever I looked in the mirror,

688
00:44:59,778 --> 00:45:01,279
I thought I could see him.

689
00:45:02,614 --> 00:45:05,367
Honestly, it felt really surreal

690
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:10,330
to know that the person closest to me
had disappeared from the world.

691
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:14,125
I think I know how you felt.

692
00:45:18,713 --> 00:45:19,713
But...

693
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:22,234
at some point, in the summer
of my second year of middle school,

694
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:23,385
it all became fine again.

695
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:27,931
A world that seemed so surreal to me
gradually started feeling more real.

696
00:45:28,515 --> 00:45:29,724
Did you get over it?

697
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:32,060
I don't know.

698
00:45:34,145 --> 00:45:35,145
Whatever it was...

699
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,192
I got used to feeling
like there was someone else there.

700
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:42,362
Feeling like someone else was there?

701
00:45:43,947 --> 00:45:45,800
Do you feel like your twin brother
is there beside you,

702
00:45:45,824 --> 00:45:46,991
just like he used to be?

703
00:45:47,492 --> 00:45:48,952
It doesn't feel quite like a twin.

704
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:50,955
After a year,
I started to acknowledge and accept

705
00:45:51,496 --> 00:45:53,832
that my younger brother had died.

706
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:56,459
It's hard to explain, but...

707
00:45:57,085 --> 00:46:00,380
In any case, I feel like I'm not alone,
and that there's someone else next to me.

708
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:05,218
Maybe you feel that way after having coped

709
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:07,817
with that feeling of loss and separation.

710
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:14,060
Your secret's safe with me.

711
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:15,936
Same.

712
00:46:16,646 --> 00:46:18,189
I'll keep your plan a secret.

713
00:46:18,273 --> 00:46:19,441
I'm being serious.

714
00:46:19,524 --> 00:46:20,775
I'm being serious too.

715
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,737
Even now,
I feel like there's one more of me.

716
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,238
This is really a secret.

717
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:28,158
All right.

718
00:46:32,245 --> 00:46:33,705
Now that we've shared our secrets,

719
00:46:33,788 --> 00:46:35,832
I guess we'll have to get back
to driving practice.

720
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,042
Get in. Let's go.

721
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:42,213
SHIN DONGHYUK ORTHOPEDICS

722
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:27,008
Ah, why?

723
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:28,718
That's not true.

724
00:47:39,395 --> 00:47:40,772
Of course I'm alone.

725
00:47:41,314 --> 00:47:43,691
You never know. Ji Sooheon might be
watching you right now.

726
00:47:43,775 --> 00:47:45,443
Don't even try to check outside.

727
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:49,197
I get that,

728
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,966
but what should I do
if he tries to attack me now?

729
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,618
He's probably not prepared yet,
so he won't attack you right now.

730
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:56,472
He's probably checking to make sure
the RV park is a good place to attack you.

731
00:47:56,496 --> 00:47:57,848
That's probably all he's doing right now.

732
00:47:57,872 --> 00:47:59,266
He's trying to judge
whether it's the place

733
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,851
where you'll be alone as much as possible.

734
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:01,876
Without being noticed.

735
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,044
<i>Wow, fuck.</i>

736
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:05,296
I'd be fucked if he rushed in right now.

737
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,881
My brothers aren't here beside me.

738
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:08,091
Hey.

739
00:48:08,591 --> 00:48:10,426
Don't overreact and just stay calm.

740
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,220
You need to make him believe

741
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:13,739
that no one else is going to come
visit you at the RV park.

742
00:48:13,763 --> 00:48:15,306
<i>All right.</i>

743
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,065

Ms. Shin has...

747
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:42,435
passed away.

- What?

757
00:50:31,776 --> 00:50:34,028
<i>Sooheon's cell phone seems to be off.</i>

758
00:50:34,112 --> 00:50:35,798
<i>Could you go downstairs
and check to see if Sooheon's there?</i>

759
00:50:35,822 --> 00:50:37,532
Yes, I'm on my way.

760
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:43,579
Sooheon! Sooheon!

761
00:50:53,798 --> 00:50:55,359
<i>The person you dialed cannot be reached...</i>

762
00:50:55,383 --> 00:50:56,801
What do I do?

763
00:51:10,064 --> 00:51:12,191
Hey, Chanmi, what's up?

764
00:51:19,824 --> 00:51:22,076
She passed away?

765
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:25,580
Oh, no.

766
00:51:27,707 --> 00:51:28,750
Sooheon?

767
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:30,626
You can't reach him?

768
00:51:30,918 --> 00:51:32,295
He's not at the gym?

769
00:51:33,463 --> 00:51:34,881
I have no idea.

770
00:51:34,964 --> 00:51:36,174
Hold on a sec.

771
00:51:36,924 --> 00:51:38,843
Ajung, Ajung.

772
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:40,553
Yeah, Soyeon.

773
00:51:40,636 --> 00:51:42,847
- Do you know where Sooheon is right now?
- Huh?

774
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:46,309
His mother just passed away,
but they can't reach him.

775
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:47,685
What?

776
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:49,187
Chanmi.

777
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,730
Ah, there's no way Ajung would know.

778
00:51:51,314 --> 00:51:53,399
What should I do?
Who should I be asking right now?

779
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:56,402
Jaebum.

780
00:51:57,153 --> 00:51:58,821
Did you call Jaebum?

781
00:52:03,743 --> 00:52:05,828
Chanmi, calm down.

782
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:07,580
Are you saying...

783
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:10,249
Sooheon's mother passed away,

784
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,460
but that you're not able
to reach him right now?

785
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:20,009
Chanmi, I'll come to you.
Just try to find out what's going on.

786
00:52:21,052 --> 00:52:22,887
Yeah, I'm heading out right now.

787
00:52:30,853 --> 00:52:32,831
- Soyeon, what should we do?
- What? What's going on?

788
00:52:32,855 --> 00:52:35,667
I think Sooheon is here right now,
and that's why his cell phone is off.

789
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:36,877
<i>Hey guys, can I have your attention?</i>

790
00:52:36,901 --> 00:52:38,670
<i>- Here comes something interesting.</i>
- What's this?

791
00:52:38,694 --> 00:52:40,071
Sa Jung...

792
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:42,448
WHAT? IS THIS A REAL?
LMAO

793
00:52:42,532 --> 00:52:43,783
What do you mean he's there?

794
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:46,751
Why would Sooheon go
to Sa Junggyeong's place?

795
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:51,498
Hey, Ajung.

796
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:52,959
Hey.

797
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:55,378
Did you go talk to Min Seonha's dad?

798
00:52:58,381 --> 00:53:00,091
Did you relay the request to Sooheon?

799
00:53:00,508 --> 00:53:02,677
- Because of the money?
- Yeah.

800
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,263
I'm sorry. I didn't know
it would end up like this...

801
00:53:21,362 --> 00:53:24,323
Where's Sa Junggyeong right now?

802
00:53:24,407 --> 00:53:25,884
That bastard Gi Osung
is waiting for Sooheon

803
00:53:25,908 --> 00:53:27,427
to assault Sa Junggyeong
on his livestream.

804
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:29,370
Agh, it's a trap! Damn it.

805
00:53:29,453 --> 00:53:31,831
So where's Sa Junggyeong right now?

806
00:53:31,914 --> 00:53:33,749
- I don't know.
- Sa Junggyeong lives alone.

807
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:35,751
Min Seonha's dad told me this.

808
00:53:35,835 --> 00:53:37,271
He told me Min Seonha
was once forcefully dragged

809
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:39,338
to Sa Jungyeong's place.

810
00:53:39,422 --> 00:53:42,302
Since Sa Junggyeong's foot is injured,
he probably lives near his school.

811
00:53:43,509 --> 00:53:45,344
Since he transferred to Hankyung High...

812
00:53:45,803 --> 00:53:49,348
Jaebum and Chanmi,
you guys head to Hankyung High now.

813
00:53:49,432 --> 00:53:51,410
We'll try to figure out
where Min Seonha was dragged to.

814
00:53:51,434 --> 00:53:53,114
- Okay, keep us posted.
- Okay. Be careful.

815
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:05,615
Who is it?

816
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:10,036
Ah, how can I help you?

817
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:13,539
Can we please speak to Seonha?
We need to ask her something.

818
00:54:13,623 --> 00:54:15,124
This is urgent.

819
00:54:21,005 --> 00:54:22,215
There he is.
