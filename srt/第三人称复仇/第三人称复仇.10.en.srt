(gasps)

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,048
That's it!

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,427
Ji Sooheon, you bastard! You're doomed.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,803
You son of a bitch!
(breathes roughly)

5
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:15,181
(grunts)
Fucking son of a bitch.

THE REAL FUN BEGINS NOW!!! LIVESTREAM

7
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,477
Wow, with the crutches.

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,895
Don't worry. The hero will win eventually.

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,230
I agree. Sa Junggyeong's legs
are injured after all.

10
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,150
-Right.
-JUNGGYEONG: <i>Stop it, you motherfucker!</i>

11
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,651
-Fucking shit, you motherfucker!
-(all grunt)

12
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,778
Wow, did he really block that?

13
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,156
(Junggyeong pants)

14
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,198
Fuck.
(grunts)

15
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,533
(exhales deeply)

16
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,326
NAKJUN: <i>Oh, oh, oh!
He's taking it off! He's taking it off!</i>

17
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,454
(suspenseful music)

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,209
(whooshing)

19
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,922
(breathes roughly)

20
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,632
THE REAL FUN BEGINS NOW!!! LIVESTREAM

21
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,718
(breathes roughly)

22
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,889
JAEBUM: Osung.

23
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,515
Was your livestream a success?

24
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,600
Fuck.

25
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,811
(breathes roughly)

26
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,775
(pants)

27
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,778
(exhales deeply)

28
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,321
(chuckles lightly)

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,577
REVENGE OF OTHERS

30
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,460
TWENTY MINUTES AGO

31
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,254
Yeah, we're heading towards
where you told us to go.

32
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,839
Uh...

33
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,383
Yeah, we just passed
the convenience store.

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,136
Left turn, left turn.

35
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,770
Yes, if you go straight from there,
you'll see the RV.

36
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,980
Oh, okay. Thank you, Seonha.

37
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,732
Of course.

38
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,068
-Oh, no. This is all because of me.
-(hurried breathing)

39
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,320
No Seonha, this isn't your fault.

40
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,948
Those demons Sa Junggyeong and Gi Osung
are the ones to blame.

41
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,324
(Ajung sighs)

42
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,744
Chanmi will be able to get to Sooheon
before something bad happens, right?

43
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,040
(breathes deeply)

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,179
(breathes roughly)

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,724
-CHANMI: Sooheon!
-(Sooheon gasp)

46
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,643
(whispering)
Sooheon!

47
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,070
(sniffles)

48
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,366
(somber music)

49
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,956
(sobbing)

50
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,670
(siren blaring)

51
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,053
(whooshing)

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,103
Seok Jaebum.

53
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,606
I won't forgive you for this.

54
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,859
(siren blaring in distance)

55
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,072
Shit.

56
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,452
JUNGGYEONG'S COUSIN: You!

57
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,037
(frustrated sigh)

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,915
What is this?
That wasn't that bastard Ji Sooheon!

59
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,167
The police are here. Go, now.

60
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,543
Fuck, hang tight.

61
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,836
(tires screech)

62
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,964
(siren blares)

63
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,259
Fuck.

64
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,184
(sighs)

65
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,852
Gi Osung.

66
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,231
I guess you have some explaining to do?

67
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,734
(sighs)

68
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,905
JUNGGYEONG: Fuck.

69
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,532
Hey, Seok Jaebum.

70
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,576
Were you the one who smashed my foot?

71
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,869
I know it wasn't you, huh?

72
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,038
I guess you were waiting for someone else?

73
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,249
Do you have a death wish, you bastard?

74
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,961
(grunts)

75
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,421
Who was it?

76
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,715
The one you were waiting for?

77
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,634
You know who he is, don't you?

78
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,888
Stop it.

79
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,600
The livestream is over.

80
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,060
You guys need to come with me
to the police station.

81
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,104
Gi Osung just had to screw up like this.

82
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,105
You.

83
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,774
Hand me that mask.

84
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,861
What are you doing?
I asked you to hand over the evidence.

85
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,239
Hurry up and get out of there.

86
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,700
This RV needs to be preserved
for evidence.

87
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,456
(sighs lightly)

88
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,166
FUNERAL HALL

89
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,294
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

90
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,716
(somber music)

91
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,814
(somber music continues)

92
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,449
It was Gi Osung
who planned the incident last night.

93
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,118
He had several assistants
to put together his livestream,

94
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,330
including Sa Junggyeong,
his cousin, and his friend.

95
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,539
GI WANGDO, HEAD OF YONGTAN POLICE STATION

96
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,167
Sa Junggyeong's cousin and his friend
have criminal records.

97
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,084
(sighs)

98
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,086
I let the five people involved
with the livestream incident

99
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,588
go back home on the condition

100
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,922
that they come
to the station this morning.

101
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,591
What's wrong with them?

102
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,844
Why the hell are they playing cops
and robbers? On a livestream?

103
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,138
Sir. This wasn't a game.

104
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,890
They had a clear intention
to catch the culprit

105
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,601
and reveal his identity
to their fellow students.

106
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,061
Yeah, I know!

107
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,189
Osung set a trap to catch the culprit,

108
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,899
and he had set up the camera, right?

109
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:03,154
Gi Osung seems to know a lot
about these recent cases.

110
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,572
(sighs)

111
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,741
Are you implying that

112
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,494
there's a clear connection
to the body shop incident?

113
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,079
That is what I suspect.

114
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,165
I'll report to you
after the investigation.

115
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,257
(sighs)

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,842
Detective Jin.

117
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,969
What?

118
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,180
Do you remember the guy
who was wearing the mask?

119
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,223
Seok Jaebum?

120
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,516
He's the only son of the owner
of Seungpil Group.

121
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,725
A grandson of a chaebol.

122
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,604
-So?
-He's here with 2 lawyers.

123
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,064
(sighs)

124
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,733
Let's go.

125
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,489
(sighs lightly)

126
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,327
I'm Detective Jin Sojeong.

127
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,037
I'm Mr. Seok's lawyer.

128
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,582
-Good morning.
-Why don't we head inside?

129
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,669
Sir, I'd like to be questioned alone,
if possible.

130
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,004
Ah, you don't have to do that.
No need to feel pressured.

131
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,589
We'll just be there to listen in.

132
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,674
It's not anything
to be concerned about anyway.

133
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,633
Of course.

134
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,803
Since it's not a big deal,
I'd like to be questioned alone.

135
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,513
Would that be okay, Detective?

136
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,181
Yes.

137
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,433
(chuckles)

138
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:22,316
JAEBUM: I've known that Sa Junggyeong
lives in that RV since last month.

139
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,402
How?

140
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:28,448
Because I've seen him smoking
in front of his RV while driving.

141
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,868
-Do you have a license?
-Yes.

142
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,538
I'm not a minor.

143
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,417
Then did you drive to the RV
with your car?

144
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,960
No, I took a taxi.

145
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,546
Because I had been drinking
at a nearby park.

146
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,591
I was watching the livestream there

147
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,384
when suddenly Sa Junggyeong came on.

148
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,970
So I assumed that Gi Osung

149
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,514
was staging a hero act
with the livestream.

150
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:58,811
That's when I suddenly felt
this strong urge to punish Sa Junggyeong

151
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,730
just as the hero would.

152
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,857
(inhales deeply)
You know the hero, right?

153
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,027
The hero who crushed Sa Junggyeong's foot
earlier this semester.

154
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,702
Anyways, I didn't want to lose
the chance to claim the title,

155
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,579
so I took a taxi and headed to the RV.

156
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915
What about the mask?

157
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,127
Do you always carry a mask with you?

158
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,755
No, of course not.

159
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,758
I found it on the road.

160
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,760
-The mask?
-Yes.

161
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,762
I thought of that as part
of playing a hero.

162
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,348
So I put the mask on and headed to the RV.

163
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,061
I trusted that Osung would help me out
if things went wrong.

164
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,147
Do you still believe
that the livestream incident

165
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,316
was a part of a hero make-believe?

166
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,110
(exhales deeply)

167
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,196
I mean...

168
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,199
I could never have imagined

169
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,576
that I'd see Osung
make a facial expression like that.

170
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,206
After taking my mask off,
Osung looked very surprised at first.

171
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,500
Then he became extremely mad.

172
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,586
That was the moment when

173
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,881
I thought maybe
this wasn't actually a prank.

174
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,758
That's what crossed my mind.

175
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,177
Oh, by the way, Detective.

176
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,096
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

177
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,641
Will this be considered a crime?

178
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,727
(light scoff)

179
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,442
We're trying to figure out right now
whether it will be or not.

180
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,611
Ah.

181
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,697
I see.

182
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,116
(sighs)

183
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,663
Jaebum, could you tell me about the reason

184
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,456
why you took a year off from school?

185
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,671
(Jaebum exhales deeply)

186
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,133
Well, that's not really related
to what happened last night,

187
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,467
but I'll tell you.

188
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,054
I was involved in a traffic accident.

189
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,683
I was in the hospital for half a year.

190
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,768
I even lost all of my memories.

191
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:16,240
I wanted to get revenge
on the guy who did this to my foot.

192
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,535
It's not a crime to think that, is it?

193
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,955
Did you not understand what I said?

194
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,499
I'm asking how you knew
the hero was going to come to your RV.

195
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,959
(scoffs)

196
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,129
Detective, how would you know
when a fish would come to bite your bait

197
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,130
while you're fishing?

198
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,383
You just leave the bait and wait.

199
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,135
What was the bait?

200
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,638
The bait?

201
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,599
Junggyeong,

202
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,434
you couldn't have been the bait.

203
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,519
You had already been punished

204
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,812
and even transferred
to a different school.

205
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,980
Why would he come back
to punish you again?

206
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,358
(chuckles)
Well...

207
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,400
Min Seonha.

208
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,028
I know you've been harassing her again.

209
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,491
If you started harassing her again,
the hero would come back for you.

210
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,160
That was the bait, wasn't it?

211
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,245
(scoffs)

212
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,123
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

213
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,502
How did Gi Osung get involved with this?

214
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,379
Gi Osung was the one who approached me
about it. About catching the hero.

215
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,297
Why did he want to catch the hero?

216
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,174
Has the hero done anything to Gi Osung?

217
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,301
I don't know about that.
(inhales deeply)

218
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,594
But in any case, Gi Osung told me

219
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
it would be fun to do a livestream
and asked me to join.

220
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,140
So Gi Osung knows who the hero is?

221
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,058
(light chuckle)

222
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,894
Because he was planning to unmask
the hero on his livestream.

223
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,940
(chuckling)
I said I have no idea.

224
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,820
Why was your gangster cousin
there with you during the livestream?

225
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,863
The vehicle that was used
for the livestream belongs to him.

226
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,741
He was just helping a cousin.

227
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,499
Don't you feel like Gi Osung used you?

228
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,795
(scoffs)

229
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,299
I'm not so sure about that.

230
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,392
I think I was being careless.

231
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,020
This is the last time
I would ever do something like this.

232
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,439
I'm not here for your apology.

233
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,190
I need you to tell us
what really happened.

234
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,192
We don't think this was a prank.

235
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,028
I just wanted to become popular
with the other kids.

236
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,613
Do you think the other kids enjoyed it?

237
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,699
What?

238
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,908
I'm asking if you thought the other kids

239
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,785
would enjoy you revealing
the hero's identity.

240
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,454
The kids love the hero.

241
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,915
But what you did could've put him
at risk of being arrested.

242
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,420
Wouldn't that have caused the other kids
to blame you for causing his arrest?

243
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,965
The result would have been
the opposite of what you had wanted.

244
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,718
I'm pretty sure
you had that figured out already.

245
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,429
(sighs)
I didn't consider that possibility.

246
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,807
You just wanted to hand
the hero over to us,

247
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,852
even if it meant
that you'd risk getting blamed for it.

248
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,897
(chuckles)
Come on.

249
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,774
(sighs)
That's just not true.

250
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,485
What did you think about Seok Jaebum
putting on a mask?

251
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,404
-And coming to the RV?
-You should ask him about that.

252
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,572
I'm asking what you thought about it.

253
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,032
Of course,
I had no idea that would happen.

254
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,283
It made things more fun though.

255
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,576
(inhales deeply)

256
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,286
That's why I'm saying
that the livestream was just for fun.

257
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,997
It didn't seem like you were
enjoying it though, in the livestream.

258
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,250
Your expression was priceless
when you took Seok Jaebum's mask off.

259
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,169
Your face looked really mad.

260
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,047
I was just really shocked is all.

261
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,799
Who were you expecting to see?

262
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,134
Whose face did you want to reveal on air
when you took that mask off?

263
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,928
I didn't have anyone in mind.

264
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,890
I believe you already know about
Park Wonseok's murder case, yes?

265
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,017
Since you were in the same school,
same year?

266
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,018
Of course I do.

267
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,770
And I believe you're already familiar
with Ju Hyeokgeon's case,

268
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,854
the juvenile delinquent, correct?

269
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,733
Since you went to the same middle school
as Ju Hyeokgeon,

270
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,861
and your study café receipt
was found at the crime scene?

271
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,196
Yes, I'm aware of that.

272
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,449
We believe these cases
are connected to each other.

273
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,952
(inhales sharply)
In both of the murder cases,

274
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,497
the victims were punished by the hero.

275
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,001
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

276
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,504
No, I think you know perfectly well
what I'm talking about.

277
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,130
(scoffs)

278
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,385
Me?

279
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,096
Ah.

280
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,264
I do know.

281
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,558
I know about all three of those cases.

282
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,188
Besides that, what else would I know?

283
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,190
Are you trying to make me out
to be a scapegoat?

284
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,068
What you wanted was to hand the hero
over to the police,

285
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,820
since we failed to arrest the culprit.

286
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,073
It may have seemed like
you were trying to reveal who the hero was

287
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,993
to the students through the livestream,
but actually you wanted the police to see.

288
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,369
Stop talking nonsense.

289
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,789
And once the police arrested the hero
from Sa Junggyeong's case,

290
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,294
the hero would be under investigation
for all the other cases as well.

291
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,588
(suspenseful music)

292
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,094
Have I revealed too much of your plans?

293
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,182
This is a pretty common trick
criminals use to distract the police.

294
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,434
Are you telling me

295
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,438
I'm a suspect in both murder cases?

296
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,399
(scoffs)

297
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,318
(sighs)

298
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,490
I personally believe

299
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,328
Ji Sooheon's the killer.

300
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,041
(sighs)

301
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,126
(suspenseful music)

302
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,810
GO GO STADIUM MEMBERS

303
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,911
I'm here to pay my respects.

304
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,829
(sighs)

305
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,739
May your mother rest in peace.

306
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,450
I know things will be hard for you,

307
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,536
but I hope you're able
to find some peace of mind.

308
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,579
Thank you.

309
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,039
My deepest condolences to you.

310
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,334
(silently)
Thank you.

311
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,678
REST IN PEACE

312
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,929
Please have some food before you leave.

313
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,347
It's okay, thank you.

314
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,099
Honey, let's go.

315
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,225
I wish you all well.

316
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,526
NEUNGWHA HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

317
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,113
Maybe we should've stayed longer.
There weren't that many people in there.

318
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,033
My presence would've only
made him feel uncomfortable.

319
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,993
You think so?
(inhales deeply)

320
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,162
Anyways, I feel bad for Ji Sooheon.

321
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,040
He's completely alone in this world now.

322
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,216
Come on, let's have some lunch too.

323
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,970
(grunts)

324
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,723
Sooheon.

325
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,767
I know you probably
don't have much of an appetite,

326
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,268
but you have to eat something.

327
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,103
Okay. You guys eat up, too.

328
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,356
Thank you for helping me out.

329
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,986
We don't know much
about what to do at a funeral.

330
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,322
So if there's anything you have in mind,
just let us know.

331
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,324
Okay, sounds good.

332
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,201
Let's eat.

333
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,288
Ah, Jaebum.

334
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,958
Do you know the people who were just here?

335
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,754
Yes, they're cops.

336
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,258
That woman was the police officer
who raided Sa Junggyeong's RV last night.

337
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,218
Who was the man?

338
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,136
He's probably a cop as well.

339
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,846
That's just overkill.

340
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,473
The cops followed you to the funeral?

341
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,933
They're here to pay their respects.

342
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,062
Were you okay at the police station?

343
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,856
I'm sorry I got you involved in that.

344
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,316
Nah, it's nothing.

345
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,027
I told them it was out of curiosity,

346
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,279
and they couldn't find anything
to charge me with.

347
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,866
How did you explain the mask to them?

348
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,828
I just told them I found it
on the side of the road near the RV.

349
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,871
(scoffs)
And did they believe you?

350
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,166
Well, that's what I told them.
What else could they do?

351
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,711
Let's talk about that some other time.

352
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,508
Let's eat.

353
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,677
(chomps)

354
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,428
(sighs lightly)

355
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,433

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,411
(dramatic music)

361
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,310
Thank you guys

362
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,520
for all your help.

363
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,742
Actually,

364
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,078
Park Wonseok is here too.

365
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,295
Well, I guess you could say
I was close to Park Wonseok.

366
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,507
But I never knew where his ashes were.
I've never been here before, either.

367
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,301
I'm sorry, Chanmi.

368
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,011
(slight chuckle)
No worries.

369
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,095
Where is he?

370
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,141
Let's go together to pay respects.

371
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,268
Uh...

372
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,103
Yeah? Shall we then?

373
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,148
DATE OF BIRTH APR 12TH, 2004
PARK WONSEOK

374
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,025
DATE OF DEATH DEC 23RD, 2021

375
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,276
(Ajung sniffles)

376
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,319
(sobbing)

377
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,320
Ah, shit.

378
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,738
I know that photo.

379
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,824
He showed it to me,
saying he looked great in it.

380
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,411
Why in the world can't the police
manage to catch the killer?

381
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,580
Are they even investigating it?

382
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,791
We may not know who did it,

383
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,127
but if the suspect managed
to play that video in the auditorium,

384
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,797
shouldn't they have already arrested
the suspect by now?

385
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,298
What are they doing? Seriously.

386
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,178
Chanmi.

387
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,515
Do you and Sooheon know something?

388
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,984
We have a suspect

389
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,986
in mind.

390
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:19,987
Seriously?

391
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,411
The person who I think did it is...

392
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,955
Gi Osung.

393
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,542
Gi Osung?

394
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,751
Gi Osung?

395
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,422
I'm pretty sure of it.
It's more than a hunch.

396
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,550
But I haven't shared it
with the police yet.

397
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,260
What's keeping you?

398
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,929
It's because his father
is the head of the police station.

399
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:50,183
Oh, actually, it's because
I don't have definitive evidence yet.

400
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,729
I also feel like I won't feel satisfied

401
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,356
if I just hand him over to the police.

402
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,486
Are you sure it's Gi Osung?

403
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,863
I'm almost certain.

404
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,576
I'm sure this goes without saying,

405
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,829
but let's just keep
this to ourselves for now.

406
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,955
Of course.

407
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,123
Don't worry.

408
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,958
You don't need to worry about me either.

409
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,376
Okay.

410
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,549
-Hey, what are you looking at, stop, huh?
-Damn.

411
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,925
-(indistinct chatter)
-Hey! It's the masked Jaebum.

412
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,177
-Oh, yeah.
-(laughs)

413
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,554
You're late for class.
That's exactly what a hero would do.

414
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,638
(grunts)

415
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,683
I had to help Sooheon place
his mother's urn in a columbarium.

416
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,645
Oh. I see.

417
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,358
You're a real hero
for helping a friend in need.

418
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,777
-I'm off.
-Okay.

419
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,330
We need to talk.

420
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,048
Seok Jaebum.

421
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,972
I'm not going to treat you
as a friend anymore

422
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,724
since you've crossed the line.

423
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,228
I don't care about
what you've said to the police,

424
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,146
but I hope we can be frank
with each other.

425
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,567
On the night of the livestream,

426
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,444
you ran into Ji Sooheon near the RV,
didn't you?

427
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,613
That's why you wore Ji Sooheon's mask

428
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,781
and went into the RV
instead of him, isn't it?

429
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,324
Do I even have to answer your question

430
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,992
when you already seem to have
an answer you want to hear?

431
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,828
Don't be a coward. Tell me.

432
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,832
You met up with Ji Sooheon
and wore his mask.

433
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,378
Why were you helping Ji Sooheon?
Why did you betray me?

434
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,963
Betray you?

435
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,714
Seok Jaebum, had it not been for you,

436
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,425
I would've caught Ji Sooheon.

437
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,888
OSUNG: <i>He would've said something
while beating Sa Junggyeong up in the RV.</i>

438
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,056
JUNGGYEONG: Please, no. It wasn't me.

439
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,183
OSUNG: <i>He wouldn't have known
he was on a livestream.</i>

440
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,101
(groans)

441
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,894
He would've said something like,

442
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,564
"you need another beating
since you haven't learned your lesson."

443
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,442
He would've crushed Sa Junggyeong
for Min Seonha's sake.

444
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,734
(both groan)

445
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,902
-Did you like that?
-(screams)

446
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,529
OSUNG: <i>That was all supposed
to be livestreamed.</i>

447
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,739
Seok Jaebum,
why are you getting in my way? Why?

448
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,491
I didn't want Ji Sooheon to get caught.

449
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,118
(scoffs)

450
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,078
(exhales)

451
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,204
Ah.

452
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,207
I knew it.

453
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,917
You two met up that night.

454
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,210
If I'm being more specific,

455
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,796
I didn't want Ji Sooheon
to be caught by you.

456
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,715
What did Ji Sooheon ever do for you?

457
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,634
Has he done more for you than I have?

458
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,721
And you still have the nerve to betray me?

459
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,514
(scoffs)

460
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,224
You think you've done a lot for me?

461
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,519
You think you've treated me well?

462
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,396
(scoffs)

463
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,731
(soft laugh)

464
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,150
(sighs)
Ugh, I guess that's just how it goes.

465
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,611
There's no point in being nice to people.

466
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,530
Ugh, am I really that clueless?

467
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,784
I told you everything
you couldn't remember

468
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,661
and helped you recover.

469
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,455
And now you have the audacity
to question what I've done for you?

470
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,664
Don't you remember
you came to me for help,

471
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,875
asking all kinds of questions?

472
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,293
Was the time and effort
I put into you all for nothing?

473
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,878
That was probably your way

474
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,757
of manipulating me
and planting what you wanted me to think.

475
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,304
Why did you give me pictures
of just me and Park Wonseok?

476
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,556
JAEBUM: <i>Wasn't that your way</i>

477
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,685
<i>of making me think I was dating
Park Wonseok before I lost my memory?</i>

478
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,645
(inaudible)

479
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:26,358
<i>I know there were other photos
of you, me, Park Wonseok, and Gwon Sejin.</i>

480
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,859
Don't you think you're overreacting?

481
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,277
Your imagination
must be popping off right now.

482
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,987
Answer my question.

483
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,200
What was my intention in only
giving you photos of you and Park Wonseok?

484
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,705
It was to make sure you could remember.

485
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,542
The relationship you had
with Park Wonseok.

486
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,212
That's what's important.
The other two people don't matter.

487
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,506
(sighs)
What is it you want me to remember?

488
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,634
Are you trying to get me to recognize
the memories you've cherry-picked for me?

489
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,386
At this point,
you probably won't even believe me

490
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,222
even if I tell you the truth.

491
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,642
(sighs)

492
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,769
So I'll give you a clue.
(sighs)

493
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,230
Your family's company building.

494
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,066
The building next to the horse track.

495
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,694
The building where you jumped from
to commit suicide.

496
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,779
Well,

497
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,699
after all, you survived
and ended up in a coma instead.

498
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,828
Seok Jaebum.

499
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,081
And even though you've betrayed me,

500
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,501
you'll soon come to appreciate
what I've done for you.

501
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,877
You'll come back to me,

502
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,046
knowing that I'm the only ally
you can count on.

503
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,800
Once you remember
what happened at that building.

504
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,303
(suspenseful music)

505
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,257
(light music)

506
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,843
SOOHEON: Can you tell me something?

507
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,637
What do you want me to tell you?

508
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,680
I don't care about the topic.

509
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,932
Just...

510
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,893
-I just want to hear someone talking.
-Hmm.

511
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,936
How about a YouTube video?

512
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,939
That's fine.

513
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,816
Just talk about anything.

514
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,485
Okay.

515
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,029
Then I'm just going to tell you
something random, yeah?

516
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,155
Okay.

517
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,115
Hmm.

518
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,492
Okay.

519
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,993
(inhales deeply)

520
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,996
It was during winter break
of my second year of middle school.

521
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,539
I was planning to meet up
with my older brother

522
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,707
after a long time apart.

523
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,669
Since I was living in Busan,
and he was living in Seoul,

524
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,171
we decided to meet
somewhere in the middle.

525
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,923
Uh, Daejeon. It was in Daejeon.

526
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,007
(chuckles)

527
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,010
The thing is, it was a pretty cold day,
but even still,

528
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,345
he suddenly showed me his belly,

529
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,596
saying he wanted me
to check out his six-pack.

530
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,557
He said he'd been working out really hard
and got a six-pack.

531
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,684
(laughs)

532
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:10,146
But I couldn't see any muscle
no matter how hard I looked.

533
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,648
It was completely flat.

534
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,902
But when I looked more closely,
I noticed there was something there

535
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,112
about the size of a quarter.

536
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,322
Whether it was muscle or not,
I don't know.

537
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,576
It looked like a flat surface
with thin circular tiles,

538
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,370
-like a jade mat or something.
-(chuckles)

539
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,705
(laughs)

540
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,332
That's why I started calling him
Jade Mat from that point on.

541
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,209
You know how our last name means jade?

542
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,170
So, I changed his name on
my phone to Jade Mat

543
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,005
and called him that
whenever I sent him a message.

544
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,298
(chuckles)

545
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,883
He begged me to change it,

546
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,512
so I decided to be generous
and changed his name back to Ok Chankyu.

547
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,014
(both chuckle)

548
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,809
(breathes deeply)

549
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,311
(light music)

550
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,400
(chuckles)

551
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,819
The sun's about to set.

552
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,700
(soft chuckle)

553
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,994
(light music continues)

554
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,297
CHANMI: It looks like it's cooked.

555
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,632
SOOHEON: I think so. I'll try one.

556
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,011
CHANMI: It's hot.

557
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,555
(chomps)

558
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,641
Hmm. Hey, have some. Have some.

559
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,310
-(laughs)
-Mmm.

560
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,853
Delicious.

561
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,941
(utensils clatter)

562
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,496
This is the photo my brother sent me.

563
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,622
He told me he had taken it

564
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,123
while he was on a date
with his girlfriend.

565
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,210
Like this?

566
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,003
Yeah.

567
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,590
He told me Ajung was his girlfriend
then shared this photo with me.

568
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,091
But Ajung said they weren't actually
dating each other.

569
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,969
-That it was just a fake relationship.
-Oh.

570
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,305
She told me she's allergic to clams.

571
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,599
But...

572
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,726
Ah...

573
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,236
even though he said it was his girlfriend,

574
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:26,324
I wonder if the person
he was actually dating

575
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,117
was one of the people in this photo.

576
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,495
I've never heard of anything
like that before.

577
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,622
(scoffs)

578
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,291
Just something I was thinking about.

579
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,296
Maybe one of these four guys
might know something?

580
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,383
If that's the case...

581
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,969
Seok Jaebum has lost all his memories...

582
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,430
Gwon Sejin is out of reach
since he left for the United States...

583
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,059
My older brother can't tell us
anything about it...

584
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,147
So the only one left is Gi Osung.

585
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,358
Are you saying Gi Osung's
the only one who can tell us?

586
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,653
I guess he's both a suspect
and a witness at the same time.

587
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,322
We need to find a way to get him to talk.

588
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,702
(both sigh)

589
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,208
I shouldn't have brought it up.

590
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,794
Let's just eat for now. Eat.

591
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,296
Okay.

592
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,007
(clatters)

593
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,259
Eat up.

594
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,807
-(knocking)
-WANGDO: <i>Come in.</i>

595
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,321
Why are you taking away
my phone all of a sudden?

596
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,116
Isn't it obvious?

597
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,410
I promised you I won't ever do
another livestream anymore.

598
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,454
What's going on with you recently?

599
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,581
Have you lost your mind?

600
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,292
At the police station,
the guys are talking about

601
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,252
whether they should look
into my own son as a murder suspect.

602
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,048
Meanwhile, my very son
is playing pranks and imitating crimes!

603
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,052
Is this what I get for trusting you?

604
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,264
Stop getting involved
in all this weird nonsense.

605
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,475
I forbid you to go anywhere else
but school and home.

606
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,186
Where's your answer?

607
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,272
-Yes, father.
-Now go.

608
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,237
(sighs)

609
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,039
(grunts)

610
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,295
(clatters in distance)

611
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,638
(gasps)

612
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,933
(sighs lightly)

613
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,689
(suspenseful music)

614
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,782
(gasps)

615
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,661
(gasps)

616
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,037
(grunts)

617
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,417
(suspenseful music continues)

618
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,812
(gasps)

619
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,233
(suspicious music)

620
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,215
(breathes deeply)

621
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,054
(sighs)

622
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,938
Who are you?

623
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,984
(sighs)

624
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,994
(inhales deeply)

625
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,998
-Uh, Jaebum.
-Hey.

626
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,877
-I'm not late, am I?
-No, I just got here early.

627
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,962
I'm sorry I asked to meet up
so early in the morning.

628
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,423
No worries. It's fine. What's up?

629
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,009
I have a favor to ask you.

630
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,469
(chuckles awkwardly)

631
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,471
Seems like every time we meet,
I'm asking for a favor. Sorry.

632
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,430
(sighs lightly)

633
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,890
In that case,
let me ask you for a favor first.

634
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,059
Stop saying you're sorry. Please.

635
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,102
(laughs)

636
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,646
Okay, done.

637
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,772
(chuckles)

638
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,649
So, what is it? Tell me.

639
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,944
Ah, uh...

640
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,990
It's about Gi Osung.

641
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,159
Gi Osung?

642
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,786
Yeah.

643
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,424
Have you thought
more about that clue I gave you?

644
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,344
Did you remember anything?

645
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,098
That employee training building.

646
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,686
Does it have something to do
with Park Wonseok?

647
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,687
Ooh.

648
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,313
Whoa, what else?

649
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:58,698
Osung, I promise I'll trust what you say,
so can you just tell me the truth?

650
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,074
You're going to trust me?

651
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,827
(scoffs)

652
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,495
I will.

653
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,373
You're the only person who can tell me
the truth now.

654
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,001
Please.

655
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,878
(scoffs)

656
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,964
I'm just so frustrated.

657
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,799
Please, Osung.

658
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,303
Jaebum.

659
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,639
You've been good about solving
all the riddles up until now.

660
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,601
You're so close,
but your explanations still fall short.

661
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,936
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

662
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,523
You figured out it wasn't
a car accident, right? That's correct.

663
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,192
It wasn't a car accident.

664
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,612
You remembered that you tried to kill
yourself at the stables, right?

665
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,531
It wasn't the stables.

666
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,534
It was the employee
training building next to it.

667
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,746
Do you realize that tomorrow
will mark a year

668
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,122
since the incident happened?

669
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,957
April 22nd.

670
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,503
We went horse riding together that day
because it was school foundation day.

671
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,547
So I jumped from

672
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,884
the employee training building.

673
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,261
You're right about falling from the roof
of the employee training building.

674
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,305
But that wasn't something
you decided to do on your own.

675
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,434
What do you mean?

676
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,144
Someone

677
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,689
pushed you off from the roof
of the building, and you fell.

678
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,072
Are you serious?

679
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,115
I thought you said
you were going to trust me?

680
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,493
You said you were going to trust
what I told you.

681
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,913
If you don't believe me,
we can just stop here.

682
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,207
I trust you.

683
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,251
I trust what you're saying.

684
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,879
Who do you think

685
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,132
pushed you off the rooftop?

686
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,230
Was it Park Wonseok?

687
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,940
(inhales deeply)

688
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,483
Correct.

689
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,446
You've solved all the riddles.

690
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,949
It was Park Wonseok.

691
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,660
The one who put you in a coma.

692
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,414
Your parents were busy sweeping it
under the rug

693
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,708
because they thought
you had tried to kill yourself.

694
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,252
But it was Park Wonseok who did it.

695
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,586
(sighs)

696
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,754
How...

697
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,966
how do you know
it was Park Wonseok who did it?

698
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,720
I saw him with my own eyes.

699
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,221
You saw him?

700
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,642
-If you did, why...
-Why didn't I report him to the police?

701
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,103
Why didn't I tell your parents about it?

702
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,442
Because Park Wonseok saw me as well.

703
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,319
That means...

704
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,238
Hey, Seok Jaebum, Gi Osung.

705
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,365
What are you guys doing here?

706
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,575
(shaking)

707
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,660
Go back to class, now.

708
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,547
(exhales deeply)

709
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,014
(door closes)

710
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,607
Mom, have you been reunited with Soomin?

711
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,524
DATE OF BIRTH JULY 2ND 2002
JI SOOMIN

712
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,609
DATE OF DEATH MAR 18TH 2019

713
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,526
DATE OF BIRTH DEC 3RD 1974
SHIN YOOKYUNG

714
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,903
Soomin, are you with Mom?

715
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,159
I'm jealous of you guys.

716
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,543
Wow, that's so pretty.

717
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,920
Really?

718
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,129
Hey, Ji Sooheon.

719
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,172
YONGTAN HIGH
READING & DEBATE COMPETITION

720
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,799
Hey, long time no see.

721
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,135
I heard about your mother.

722
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,554
I couldn't be there to pay my respects

723
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,265
because I was held up
at the police station, thanks to you.

724
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,811
-I hope you understand.
-(sighs)

725
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,023
You.

726
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,735
I guess you dragged
Seok Jaebum into it too.

727
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,030
You may have escaped this time
thanks to him,

728
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,615
but time's ticking for you.

729
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,201
(sighs deeply)

730
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,328
I feel so sorry for you.

731
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,414
You'll have no one to visit you
once you're in jail.

732
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,750
(breathes deeply)

733
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,381
(grunts)

734
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,549
-(grunts)
-Leave me! Shit!

735
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,134
Sooheon, calm down, calm down, okay?

736
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,689
NAKJUN: Huh, huh? Hey, Sooheon.

737
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,023
-Sooheon!
-What's going on?

738
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,191
Sooheon, Sooheon!

739
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,276
SOYEON: Sooheon.

740
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,277
-Wake up, Sooheon.
-Sooheon, Sooheon.

741
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,945
-SOYEON: Hey, Sooheon. What's going on?
-NAKJUN: Sooheon, Sooheon, Are you okay?

742
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,655
-DEOKHYEON: What's going on?
-ALL: Mr. Jo!

743
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,865
DEOKHYEON: Tell me what's going on!

744
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,950
-Sooheon, are you all right?
-Sooheon! Hey, Sooheon, wake up!

745
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:53,868
-Ji Sooheon!
-Ji Sooheon!

746
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,035
SOYEON: Wake up!

747
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,078
-DEOKHYEON: Sooheon, Sooheon.
-NAKJUN: Sooheon, are you all right?

748
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,329
SOYEON:
Hey! Hey, what's going on with you?

749
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,831
Hi, this is Yongtan High School...

750
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,166
Open your eyes.

751
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,211
OSUNG: <i>It was Park Wonseok.</i>

752
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,047
<i>The one who put you in a coma.</i>

753
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,844
(dramatic music)

754
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,270
What happened?

755
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,938
He was fighting Gi Osung
when he suddenly passed out.

756
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,190
-What should we do?
-(gasps)

757
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,357
-(Deokhyeon grunts)
-Where are you going, sir?

758
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,235
To the nearest hospital.
Get out of the way. Move.

759
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,154
You need to go to Woosung Hospital.
He has a brain tumor.

760
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,489
There's a doctor there
who's taking care of him.

761
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,531
You need to go there.

762
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,657
Call Woosung Hospital,
and you, get in the ambulance.

763
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,909
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

764
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,372
(grunts)

765
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,877
AMBULANCE
119 EMERGENCY

766
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,505
Everyone, go inside. Go inside, everyone.

767
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,258
Sooheon...

768
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,594
has a brain tumor...

769
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,637
(sniffles)

770
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,349
(sighs)

771
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,559
DESIGNATED MEETING TIME
BY MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE

772
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,477
MEETING TIME: 12:00 - 14:00
17:30 - 20:00

773
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,394
ENTRANCE TO THE FACILITY IS LIMITED
TO VISITING HOURS

774
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,312
WE ASK FOR YOUR COOPERATION

775
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,690
I believe we met at the funeral, no?

776
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,067
Yes, we did.

777
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,151
It seems you already knew that Sooheon

778
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,153
was coming to this hospital
and that he was sick?

779
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,616
Is Sooheon okay?

780
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,076
I don't believe his life
is at risk right now.

781
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,202
(sighs)

782
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,413
Sooheon will be asleep
for the next 24 hours.

783
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,249
So don't worry about him and go home.

784
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,583
I'll call you once he's awake.

785
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,961
Thank you, sir.

786
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,337
See you later.

787
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,839
Excuse me, doctor.

788
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,096
Will Sooheon really

789
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,682
die because of this?

790
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,475
His condition might become critical
at some point,

791
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,270
or it might stay the same as it is now.

792
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,438
What do you mean it might stay
the same as it is now?

793
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,107
Are you asking when the end might be?

794
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,693
It's just like what life is like
for the rest of us.

795
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,070
We do our best and keep moving along.

796
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,156
That's what's important. Trying our best.

797
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,959
(sighs)

798
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,850
Go back to class, now.

799
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,560
(grunts)

800
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,607
What happened after Park Wonseok saw you?

801
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,944
What kept you from reporting him
to the police?

802
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,654
Tell me the truth.

803
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,740
(sighs)

804
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,491
Okay, I wasn't going to,
but I'll tell you what you want.

805
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,118
You really should thank me.

806
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,120
I had to save myself.

807
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:47,041
Park Wonseok knew one of my weaknesses
and had me in a bind.

808
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,126
(scoffs)

809
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,587
You didn't report him
for fear of him revealing your weakness?

810
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,422
Jaebum.

811
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,759
Reporting him
wouldn't have changed anything.

812
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,220
Besides, you fell into a coma
after falling from the rooftop.

813
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,058
And Park Wonseok
is no longer a part of this world.

814
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,394
That's why I told you.

815
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,064
Not to get too close with Ok Chanmi,
Park Wonseok's younger sister.

816
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,318
But you didn't listen to me
and you became close with them anyway.

817
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,278
Jaebum.

818
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,280
I deserve better.

819
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,948
Park Wonseok.

820
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,662
Why did Park Wonseok do that to me?

821
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,871
I have no clue.

822
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,957
It was between you and Park Wonseok.

823
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,839
(breathes deeply)

824
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,593
(breathes shakily)

825
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,270
I did some research online during class.

826
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,856
Brain tumors can be deadly.

827
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,441
If you get surgery,

828
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,236
you might live.

829
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,988
Why didn't he tell us he was sick?

830
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,200
If he hid it from us,
does that mean it's serious?

831
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,369
(sobbing)
Why is this happening

832
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,456
to Sooheon?

833
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,125
I can't believe it either.

834
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,545
Call Chanmi again.

835
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,091
AUTOMATED VOICE (on cell phone):
<i>The number you dialed is...</i>

836
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,927
Her cell phone's off.

837
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,388
(sighs)
Seriously, what's going on?

838
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,852
(somber music)

839
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,607
OSUNG: <i>Who do you think</i>

840
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,277
<i>pushed you off the rooftop?</i>

841
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,862
(sighs)

842
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,906
<i>It was Park Wonseok.</i>

843
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,366
(sighs deeply)

844
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,326
<i>The one who put you in a coma.</i>

845
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,375
(exhales deeply)

846
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,211
(inhales deeply)

847
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:03,093
(dramatic music)

848
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,852
I feel like I'm losing my mind!

849
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,104
JAEBUM: <i>I get the feeling that
I did something that I didn't do.</i>

850
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,940
<i>And for things that I did do,
I have no memory of them.</i>

851
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,192
Who are you?

852
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,194
Was I the one

853
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,529
who killed Park Wonseok?

854
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,615
(dramatic music)

855
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,296
(both laugh)

856
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,510
Wow, that was a great meal.
Wow, I'm so full.

857
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,303
-Did you enjoy that?
-Yes.

858
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,721
-(grunts)
-(laughs)

859
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,056
It was so delicious!

860
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,182
Good.

861
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,977
(inhales deeply)
Wow, it's really such a nice day.

862
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,145
Ah!

863
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,481
(exhales)

864
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:02,486
It feels good to be out here with my sons.

865
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:06,240
You chose the right day to go out.

866
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,658
(chuckles)

867
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,204
How long has it been since we all
went out on an outing like this?

868
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,003
Mom?

869
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,589
Soomin?

870
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,843
Mom!

871
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,262
Soomin?

872
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,138
Soomin?

873
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,641
(sobbing)

874
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,518
Mom!

875
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,728
Mom!

876
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,606
(sobbing)

877
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,110
(breathes heavily)

878
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,738
(breathes deeply)

879
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,574
(exhales deeply)

880
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,511

00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:16,226
Ok Chanmi was in the ambulance with you
and brought you to the hospital.

883
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,186
Ok Chanmi?

884
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,898
Yes, it was fortunate
that I was able to see you right away.

885
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,691
What?

886
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,193
I thought you told her
about the brain tumor.

887
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,695
It seemed like
she already knew everything.

888
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,948
Ah, yes.

889
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,409
If you feel something's off,
come see me right away.

890
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,161
Yes, sir.

891
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,413
-Take care.
-Thank you, sir.

SENT A VIDEO

CHANMI (on cell phone):
<i>Sooheon, are you okay?</i>

902
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,248
<i>I guess you're probably awake
if you're watching this video right now.</i>

903
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,175
I'm going to give it all up.

904
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,512
CHANMI (on cell phone):
<i>I had come to Seoul</i>

905
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,515
because I was frustrated
and wanted to catch the murderer.

906
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,475
Only to realize that it's all in vain.

907
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:45,190
I can't do anything for my brother,
or rather, Park Wonseok anymore.

908
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,944
<i>My brother...</i>

909
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,738
<i>tried to kill</i>

910
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,366
<i>Seok Jaebum.</i>

911
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,160
<i>Jaebum survived,</i>

912
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,246
<i>but that doesn't change the fact
that my brother tried to kill him.</i>

913
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,164
<i>Also...</i>

914
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,083
Sooheon.

915
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,546
<i>It's time for you to stop working
on my brother's case as well.</i>

916
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,881
<i>It's time for you
to go back to your own life.</i>

917
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,509
<i>I don't think I should keep pursuing this.</i>

918
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,388
This will be the last time
I'll be in touch with you,

919
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,849
so you shouldn't reach out to me either.

920
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,810
<i>Take your mind off this case.</i>

921
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,397
I hope you're able
to enjoy your life more.

922
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,650
I'm sorry for everything.

923
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,029

Hey.

00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,313

I saw the suspect running away.</i>

00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,799
The murderer was wearing a pair
of white sneakers with red shoelaces.

White sneakers with red shoelaces.

980
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,720
I don't recall anyone else wearing
those shoes other than Ji Sooheon...

981
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,556
Then are you saying the suspect
is pretending to be like Ji Sooheon?

982
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,604
JUNGGYEONG:
Did you fucking lose your phone?

983
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,273
Why haven't you been answering?

984
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,608

after all the shame I had to go through?

992
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:34,432
Listen, you bastard!

993
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,475
Didn't you tell me Ji Sooheon
is behind all this?

994
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,976
Now, look what a mess you've made.

995
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,145
Hey, what are we going to do
about Ji Sooheon?

996
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,563
We gotta kill him, don't we?!

997
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,107
Fuck, just hold your horses.

998
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,066
(scoffs)

999
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,567
I have a plan in mind.

1000
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,946
Hey, you bastard, you think you're
gonna kill him by just talking about it?

1001
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,697
Get Ji Sooheon and bring him to me.

1002
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,867
-Are you out of your fucking mind?
-(scoffs)

1003
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:53,910
Hey,

1004
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,995
do you have a death wish?

1018
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:47,464
Did you tell Ok Chanmi that Park Wonseok
tried to kill Seok Jaebum?

1019
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,923
I told Seok Jaebum that yesterday.

1020
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,759
Well, that was quick.

1021
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,220
And Seok Jaebum doesn't know about it?

1022
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,973
Even though Park Wonseok
tried to kill him?

1023
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,641
Of course he doesn't know.

1024
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,393
He has absolutely no memories.

1025
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,520
I think you made up that story

1026
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,483
to frame Seok Jaebum
as Park Wonseok's killer.

1027
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,234
You crazy bastard.

1028
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,820

-You killed Park Wonseok, didn't you?
-You're crazy!

1033
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,666
I'm done listening to your nonsense.
Get out already!

1034
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,335

1035
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,545
