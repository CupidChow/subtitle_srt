1
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:06,772
Don't you have something to tell us?
About this fake nude photograph?

2
00:00:06,796 --> 00:00:08,965
We've checked everyone's messages.

3
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:12,093
- Seo Dayeon, you're the original source.
- God.

4
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:14,937
Im Seungwu, that damn bastard!
I told him not to share it with anyone!

5
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:17,765
Did you create it?

6
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:19,433
What have I ever done to you?

7
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:22,353
I didn't make it.
I got this from Ok Chanmi.

8
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:23,436
What?

9
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:24,814
Ok Chanmi?

10
00:00:24,897 --> 00:00:28,526
I'm really sorry about spreading it,
but I got this from Ok Chanmi!

11
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:29,609
Unlock your phone.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,705
- Wow, did Ok Chanmi do this for real?
- Did Ok Chanmi really do this?

13
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:42,331
Is she out of her mind?

14
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:43,725
- Ok Chanmi's coming!
- Ok Chanmi, Ok Chanmi.

15
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:44,667
There she is.

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,430
Hey, hey, Ok Chanmi, Ok Chanmi, Ok Chanmi.

17
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:52,550
Why did you do that?

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,594
You crazy little...

19
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:15,322
What?

20
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:16,782
Ji, Ji Sooheon?

21
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:18,034
Hey, it's Ji Sooheon.

22
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:19,118
What's going on?

23
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:22,288
Is Ji Sooheon dating Ok Chanmi?

24
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,085
Why are they leaving together?

25
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:34,717
Hey! Let me go! I said let me go!

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,219
Going back there won't do you any good.

27
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:38,947
If it were you,
would you just suck it up and take it?

28
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:41,640
Take the blame for something
you didn't do and get slapped for it?

29
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:42,909
Why should I let everyone believe

30
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,036
that I was responsible
for something like that?

31
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,728
Shit!

32
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:47,289
What gives you the right to hold me back?

33
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:48,874
Because you're not understanding
what I told you.

34
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:50,858
- What?
- I warned you.

35
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:53,277
I told you to go back
to the school you came from.

36
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:54,486
What?

37
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:55,654
This isn't the end of it.

38
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:58,058
Things will only become more
unbearable and unfair for you.

39
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,034
Just go back to your old school.

40
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:16,341
Chanmi.

41
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:18,385
What are you doing here ditching class?

42
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,014
I wanted to ask you something.

43
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,517
We can talk in the classroom.

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,185
Don't pay attention to everyone else.

45
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:27,895
Can you show me your cell phone?

46
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:31,982
Chanmi, I didn't even think
that you made the picture

47
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:34,902
and I sent it to Im Seungwu,
that bastard, as a joke.

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,406
You should have told me that you made it.

49
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,159
Dayeon, don't be sorry.

50
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:44,078
You didn't do anything wrong.

51
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,331
Can I just see your phone?

52
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:50,042
Because the nude that you said
you received from my number

53
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:53,546
got deleted on my end.

54
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:02,572
OK CHANMI
COACH TOLD ME TO RUSH SO I CAME

55
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:03,949
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT HERE ;(
OK CHANMI I'M ON MY WAY

56
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:07,977
- Yesterday at 5:27...
- It's true that you sent it to me.

57
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:10,835
By the way, did something happen
between you and Kook Jihyun?

58
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:14,692
I've never ever called someone
a hypocrite in my entire life.

59
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,654
What do you mean?

60
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:20,340
Hey, why don't you just pretend
you're crazy

61
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:22,658
and act like nothing happened.
Just come back to class.

62
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:50,895
REVENGE OF OTHERS

63
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:57,484
Chanmi,

64
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:00,154
what in the world happened?

65
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:02,323
A nude?

66
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,158
What's going on?

67
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,410
Did something happen
between you and Kook Jihyun?

68
00:04:09,622 --> 00:04:13,834
The truth is, I didn't faint that day
in the auditorium because I was dizzy.

69
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,504
Somebody hit me
over the head with a brick.

70
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,965
What? A brick?

71
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,801
Who? Who would do such a thing?

72
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:26,680
I think this person knocked me out
then unlocked my phone with my finger.

73
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:29,576
If they had sent out a message
at that point,

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,536
nobody would ever figure out
that it wasn't me who had sent it.

75
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,645
So are you saying that

76
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,314
Kook Jihyun did it?

77
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,278
Uploading her own nude
to frame you is a little too...

78
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:47,785
Oh, wait, Chanmi,
what do you think of this?

79
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:52,376
WASH YOUR HANDS PROPERLY
FOR AT LEAST 30 SECONDS

80
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,209
I'm starving.

81
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:02,049
Why did you take Ok Chanmi with you?

82
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:04,677
I needed to break her arms
to calm myself down.

83
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,529
Because you were going to break
an innocent person's arms.

84
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:07,993
What makes you think she's innocent?

85
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,429
Why are you defending her
after seeing what she did?

86
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:11,743
Do you really think someone would
be stupid enough

87
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,370
to do something
that would expose them so easily?

88
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:14,270
Spreading something
through a messaging app

89
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:15,646
among a small group of students?

90
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:18,750
Don't you think it would be extremely easy
to track down who the original source was?

91
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:19,942
Are you...

92
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,444
trying to protect Ok Chanmi?

93
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:25,281
Why?

94
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:26,573
I mean...

95
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,951
I'm just telling you the truth.

96
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:31,036
Oh, I'm hungry.

97
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,057
These kids are so lame.

98
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:53,981
Have they really never seen
a fake nude before?

99
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:55,686
So annoying.

100
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:01,942
Why is Jaebum hanging out with that girl?

101
00:06:19,752 --> 00:06:21,545
Chanmi, the approval just came through.

102
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,273
- Oh, really? They said it was okay?
- Yeah.

103
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:25,108
They said they called the Principal
directly to get the approval.

104
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:27,009
That's amazing.

105
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:30,012
- I'll go and check in a bit.
- Awesome, thank you.

106
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:31,847
Oh, it's nothing.

107
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:33,849
I'll get you lunch next time.

108
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:35,726
Where will you take me to eat?

109
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:39,229
Thank you for granting me permission, sir.

110
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:41,857
I hope you find your bag.

111
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,943
Mr. Yoon, please help him
with whatever he needs.

112
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,612
Yes, sir. Of course.

113
00:06:47,154 --> 00:06:49,090
In that case, Jaebum,
best of luck with everything.

114
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:51,200
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- Okay then.

115
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:54,244
Now...

116
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:56,181
Did you say you misplaced it
somewhere near the auditorium?

117
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:59,041
Sometime between
five and six o'clock yesterday?

118
00:06:59,124 --> 00:06:59,958
Yes.

119
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,603
You do know that no one's allowed
to watch these recordings

120
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:02,961
without permission, right?

121
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,172
Yes, Mr. Yoon, I apologize.

122
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:07,091
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.

123
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:08,943
What I mean is, just don't let
the other students know you saw this.

124
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,094
Of course.

125
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:14,807
Press this if you want to fast forward.

126
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:17,827
And let me know once you're done.
I'll be in the room next door.

127
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,551
- Ok Chanmi, you're late.
- Yeah.

128
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:04,106
Hey, Jihyun, everyone's been talking
about some nonsense.

129
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:09,027
I know they're saying it's real nude
when It's obvious that it's fake.

130
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:12,739
Not that, there's something
else that's really ridiculous...

131
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:13,866
Ridiculous?

132
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:15,909
What's ridiculous?

133
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:21,874
Ugh, what is it?

134
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:26,462
Tell me later.

135
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,103
Remember, the words "even",
"still", "much",

136
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:35,888
"far", and "a lot" add emphasis.

137
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:39,516
This next type of question
is one that many of you continue to miss.

138
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,518
So let's go over it together.

139
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:49,193
Take a look at this sentence.

140
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:51,487
The noun is important here.

141
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,865
You might have noticed
that the noun is plural.

142
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,703
Ugh, what's with you two?

143
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,055
What were you going to tell me earlier?

144
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,956
Did that Ok Chanmi
leak another photo of me?

145
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:09,296
This is annoying the hell out of me. Shit.

146
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:10,964
So what is it?

147
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:13,318
Um, there's a rumor going around
that you and Gi Osung from class 4

148
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:14,676
are living in the same house.

149
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,678
That doesn't even make any sense, right?

150
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,764
People are saying
that you and Osung are siblings.

151
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,047
Isn't that just so ridiculous?

152
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:22,559
Did...

153
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:24,435
Did...

154
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:27,564
Ok Chanmi also start that rumor?

155
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,651
I don't think so. It didn't spread
through the messaging app.

156
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:32,402
I think it spread by word of mouth.

157
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,032
There's Gi Osung.

158
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,284
Hey, Kook Jihyun!

159
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:42,371
We need to talk.

160
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:56,218
You should have coaxed her gently.

161
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:57,403
Ok Chanmi leaked this to everyone
at school

162
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:58,488
because you went batshit crazy on her!

163
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:00,681
Didn't you see that she was
the one who started it?

164
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,933
It's a nude. A nude!

165
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,285
How could I not do anything about that?

166
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,662
I know you were probably
the one who started this

167
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:06,788
and that she reacted
by spreading this around.

168
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:08,732
Weren't you the one
who said you took care of it?

169
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:11,233
You said she'd keep her mouth shut!

170
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,236
Is this what you meant
by keeping her mouth shut?

171
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:15,112
What are you going to do now?

172
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:16,989
What do you mean?

173
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:19,324
That bitch Ok Chanmi is basically dead.

174
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:22,972
I'll make her leave this school
with her tail between her legs.

175
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:24,746
Just like that bastard Sa Junggyeong did.

176
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,914
This crazy little...

177
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:28,875
Hey! Do you even understand
what I'm saying right now?

178
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,396
Are you really going to admit
we're siblings?

179
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,260
Is there anything
in that hollow head of yours?

180
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:37,426
You moron, it'll just get worse
if we don't say anything at this point.

181
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:40,429
You deal with Ok Chanmi,

182
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:42,854
so that she doesn't cause
us any more trouble.

183
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:47,352
Shit.

184
00:10:47,436 --> 00:10:50,076
I can't believe one crazy bitch
is going to embarrass me like this.

185
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,489
Relax.

186
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:01,033
Okay, that's better.

187
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:02,868
Good, good, Captain.

188
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:16,423
How did it go?
Did you watch the security footage?

189
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:18,383
Yeah, I did.

190
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:19,968
So who was it?

191
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:24,514
Who was the person
that came into the auditorium that day?

192
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,649
No one else was in there.

193
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,361
What do you mean no one else was there?

194
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:39,196
Didn't you say
you saw the security footage?

195
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,742
I saw you enter the auditorium,
but no one else was there.

196
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:44,993
Huh?

197
00:11:45,243 --> 00:11:46,244
How is that possible?

198
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:48,688
There are only two surveillance cameras
near the auditorium.

199
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:51,792
Maybe this person knew
there was a blind spot.

200
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:55,295
Anyways, you were the only person
in the recording.

201
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,798
Since you were attacked
behind the stage curtains,

202
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:00,121
it doesn't show up
in the indoor security footage either.

203
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:12,062
Yes, Dad. I just came
through the front entrance.

204
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:16,233
Yes, I'll be right there.

205
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:22,364
Oh, yes, Senator.

206
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,760
Your district falls
within my jurisdiction,

207
00:12:25,784 --> 00:12:28,065
so there's no reason
why something like that would happen.

208
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:30,330
Yes, yes, yes,

209
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:33,250
I'll make sure to manage things
in a way that is suitable to you.

210
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,420
I hope you'll continue to lead us.
Yes. Have a wonderful day, goodbye!

211
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:41,341
Look who's here. My son, how are you?

212
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,265
You must be worn out
from all your studies, no?

213
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:46,406
You know we can always talk at home.
What brings you all the way here?

214
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,973
So, what's going on?

215
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:50,284
This isn't something
we can talk about at home.

216
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:53,108
Then what? Is this something
that can be discussed at a police station?

217
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,814
Yes.

218
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,399
Really?

219
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:59,151
Okay, then. Tell me what's going on.

220
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,402
Kook Jihyun...

221
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:02,654
I mean, Jihyun.

222
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,549
This is something I wanted
to tell you for Jihyun's sake.

223
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:05,824
For Jihyun's sake?

224
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:10,704
Go on. What is this concerning?

225
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:13,957
There's a transfer student
from Busan in Jihyun's class...

226
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,437
and there's a lot of issues
between the two of them.

227
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:21,506
So, what can I do if you tell me about it?

228
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,926
I think everything will be resolved
if you send her back to her old school.

229
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,450
I also think this will be easy to do.

230
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,015
Go on.

231
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:34,060
She's living in a residence
that's breaking the law.

232
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:39,024
GIVE IT YOUR ALL.
THE SWEAT WILL DO YOU GOOD.

233
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:41,026
KOOK JIHYUN NEW MESSAGE

234
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,486
Right? Right?

235
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:26,863
It was such bullshit.

236
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:29,783
Wow, that's legit.

237
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,243
What's legit?

238
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,994
She just gave it away.

239
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:40,502
Is that the bitch?

240
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:43,773
Doesn't she look exactly
like the way I described her?

241
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:45,841
Yeah, you're right.
Her face makes me want to vomit.

242
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:47,634
Come on.

243
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:49,261
Don't be such a pussy, come here.

244
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,847
- Come over here!
- Kook Jihyun, are you serious?

245
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:53,908
Isn't this something you and I
should talk about?

246
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,518
Hey! Conversations are for people
to engage in.

247
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,538
A despicable creature like
you doesn't have the right

248
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:00,522
to address a human being like me.

249
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:04,985
It's time you learned your lesson today.

250
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:19,708
Okay, one, two, body.

251
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,212
Harder, hit harder!

252
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,010
You've got a great punch. Truly gifted.

253
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:31,761
Now.

254
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:06,504
<i>I guess it will end like this,
suddenly and in less than a second.</i>

255
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:15,430
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
do it, do it, do it!

256
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:16,556
Come on!

257
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,160
Glare at me all you want,
it won't help you.

258
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:20,202
Hey, look at that, look at that, look!

259
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:21,227
Shit!

260
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:26,775
You psycho! Ah, shit!

261
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:30,111
Hey! Hey!

262
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,367
Ah, fuck!

263
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,510
- Stand up, stand up!
- Huh?

264
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:39,079
I told you, stand up!
Fuck, let go of me. Get up!

265
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:40,205
Shit.

266
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:41,748
Damn it.

267
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:47,337
You all worked your asses off.
Time to recharge.

268
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:49,673
Hanwoo beef barbecue is on me.

269
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:51,049
Let's go.

270
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:53,051
- Kook Jihyun, you're the best!
- Nice!

271
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:40,492
NO PARKING

272
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:57,717
STAY SAFE

273
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:03,223
Sooheon, is that you?

274
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:05,642
Oh, hello, sir.

275
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:06,911
We received a call saying that some girls

276
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,311
were fighting in the parking lot.

277
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:09,437
Ah.

278
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:13,191
I also heard them fighting,
but no one was here when I arrived.

279
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,527
Seems like they're already done.

280
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,464
Please watch who comes in and goes out
of the parking lot more carefully.

281
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:19,715
How am I supposed to keep watch
when they come crawling in

282
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:20,925
through the pedestrian entrance?

283
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:23,243
They can't expect me
to have my eyes on it 24/7.

284
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:25,954
I've had enough, seriously.

285
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:30,041
Sir, you should head back downstairs.
I'll take care of the rest.

286
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,960
Sooheon, is that really okay with you?

287
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:33,729
Yes, of course.
You should head back downstairs, sir.

288
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:34,796
Thank you.

289
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:38,633
Hah, maybe I should weld that door shut.

290
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:55,733

294
00:21:01,382 --> 00:21:02,592
Oh, hello, sir.

295
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,969
This was just a prank
that some kids are pulling on me.

296
00:21:05,053 --> 00:21:06,488
I'll take them all down
and clean up over here.

297
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,389
That's not the issue right now.

298
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:09,515
Excuse me?

299
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,601
The police came by a while ago.

300
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:13,564
They found out
that you were living here somehow

301
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:17,273
and asked me why I had a minor
on the premises.

302
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,776
So what should I do?

303
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:21,319
You need to leave right now.

304
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:22,922
Or else my permit will be revoked,

305
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:24,786
and all the other residents
will have to leave.

306
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:26,908
Go on and pack up your things right away.

307
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,661
Sir, it's already so late, how can I...

308
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,121
Can I please stay just for the night?

309
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:33,849
The cops said they'd come back
later tonight to check in again.

310
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:35,291
They left me no choice.

311
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:39,337
The other kids
are posting strange photos of you.

312
00:21:39,837 --> 00:21:41,106
And it looks like
you're getting into fights.

313
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,298
Just look at your face.

314
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:44,182
I knew I shouldn't have
let a minor live here.

315
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,635
But you kept begging me...

316
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,720
You have to pack up your things now.

317
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:50,431
Sir, sir, sir!

318
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,710
SMOKE FREE BUILDING

319
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,957
Did you watch everything at the rooftop?

320
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,335
How embarrassing.

321
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:21,379
Just erase it from your memory.

322
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,343
Oh.

323
00:22:27,427 --> 00:22:28,511
Thanks.

324
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:33,659
Since you gave me back my wallet,
I guess you can leave, yeah?

325
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:34,809
Where...

326
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,395
are you going to sleep tonight?

327
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:39,856
Why do you even ask?
It's none of your business.

328
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:41,983
You have nowhere to sleep.

329
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,651
I can look for something.

330
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:47,030
There are 24-hour saunas,
comic book cafés,

331
00:22:47,113 --> 00:22:48,448
internet cafés,

332
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:52,327
and regular 24-hour cafés...

333
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:55,038
- Plus...
- All the places you just mentioned

334
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:57,582
don't allow minors to stay overnight.

335
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:59,292
Yeah, I know, but...

336
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,919
Maybe I can reach out to my friend.

337
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:04,106
- Since when did you have any friends?
- So what do you expect me to do?

338
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,131
Ah...

339
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:07,008
I mean, what you should do is...

340
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:10,303
I mean...

341
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,263
- That.
- Huh?

342
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:30,782
Got it.

343
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:33,076
Be careful.

344
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,285
Damn.

345
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,079
How did they manage
to get it this high up?

346
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:39,082
They're quite talented.
They would be great in a circus.

347
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,876
- Let's go.
- What?

348
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,628
Go? Go where?

349
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:45,630
Let's go to my place.

350
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:47,673
What?

351
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:09,987
What's wrong?

352
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,799
You already snuck in here once
before when I wasn't home, right?

353
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:13,533
Oh, yeah...

354
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,302
All living spaces
are more or less the same,

355
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:35,012
so everything's pretty self-explanatory.

356
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:45,523
But you'll need to use the shower
and restroom in the gym downstairs.

357
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:47,316
That's the one downside.

358
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,278
The bathroom and shower
were outside in the dorm as well.

359
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:52,572
Of all the places I've lived in so far,

360
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:53,882
this is by far the biggest
and finest room.

361
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,450
Uh...

362
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,911
We, do have a washing machine
in the gym...

363
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:02,373
but just know
it's probably full of men's jerseys.

364
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:03,666
Oh, that's no problem.

365
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:05,168
I can always go to a laundromat.

366
00:25:05,251 --> 00:25:06,544
Okay.

367
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:08,212
In that case...

368
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:10,965
But hey...

369
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,718
Yeah, feel free to ask me anything.

370
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:15,678
What should I do when I'm hungry?

371
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:16,888
Huh?

372
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:19,765
I haven't had anything to eat since lunch.

GOGO STADIUM

374
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:02,683
I feel so bad.

375
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,227
Won't it be uncomfortable?

376
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,310
I'll be fine.

377
00:26:08,064 --> 00:26:09,065
Here.

378
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:11,609
Put this on, if you need one.

379
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:14,129
We have tons of these
since we're in a martial arts gym.

380
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:15,196
Ah...

381
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,159
I guess I did do
some martial arts earlier, huh?

382
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,658
Thanks.

383
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,911
But hey, shouldn't I be
the one sleeping down here?

384
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,121
I'm totally fine, really.

385
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,582
Head upstairs and rest.

386
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:28,459
Okay.

387
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:30,378
Get some rest.

388
00:27:33,566 --> 00:27:34,650
OK CHANKYU
LOL FOR REAL

389
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:35,734
YOU'RE DOOMED
OK CHANKYU

390
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:38,904
I GOT THE TOP SCORE ON MY KOREAN TEST

391
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:40,668

She was crying all night.

396
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:08,035
So I went to the convenience store
and got her some canned food.

397
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:10,686
I usually leave some food out at night,
but I didn't yesterday.

398
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,313
So that's who she's been looking for.

399
00:28:12,897 --> 00:28:13,981
What's her name?

400
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:15,482
Thor.

401
00:28:15,983 --> 00:28:16,859
Thor?

402
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:19,528
That guy with the hammer from the movie?

403
00:28:21,822 --> 00:28:24,784
I found her hiding over there
on a stormy night.

404
00:28:25,284 --> 00:28:26,911
That's when I met her.

405
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:29,413
So Lunch at school and Thor at home?

406
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,083
Thor?

407
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:36,253
Oh, her looking back at me
really made me happy.

408
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,881
Let's head to school.

409
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:42,309
- Aren't you going to eat breakfast?
- I don't usually have breakfast.

410
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,720
Oh, really?

411
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:46,472
I didn't know that, so...

412
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:50,393
I prepared a little breakfast
as a way to pay my share.

413
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:52,019
Breakfast?

414
00:29:04,907 --> 00:29:06,367
Agh, it's hot! Hot!

415
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,175
Dig in.

416
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:34,937
- Hmm.
- Taste buds don't lie.

417
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,301
You can't help but smile
when you eat something delicious.

418
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:44,113
Hmm. It's crazy good!

419
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:47,950
- This is really good.
- Isn't it?

420
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,119
Hmm.

421
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:05,986
Did you spend a lot of money
at the convenience store

422
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,595
getting all these ingredients?

423
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:09,238
I told you it was my share of the rent.

424
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:10,741
It doesn't seem
like you have a part-time job.

425
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:13,976
I've applied for a job, but I guess
they don't have any openings yet.

426
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:15,227
You're being waitlisted?

427
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:17,248
Is it a really cushy job or something?

428
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:19,607
I don't know about that, but...

429
00:30:19,815 --> 00:30:21,585
all I know is that I really need
to work there.

430
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:22,693
What's the job?

431
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:29,366
Ok Chanmi!

432
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:32,536
Hey! How are you?

433
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,979
- Are you just heading over now?
- Yeah. You look comfortable.

00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,241

435
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:43,464

- Bye!

OK CHANMI! 5TH PERIOD

437
00:31:01,482 --> 00:31:03,567
What's this? God, is this a joke?

438
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:06,195
So I can get hit over the head
with a brick again?

439
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,917
Listen closely to what I'm about to say.

440
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:22,586
I didn't make that nude.

441
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,381
And I never told anyone about you
and Gi Osung being siblings.

442
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:28,926
But I guess you're still going to
keep messing around with me, huh?

443
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:31,637
Getting me kicked out of my dorm,

444
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,490
posting fake nudes of me
all over the place,

445
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:35,224
and beating me up with your posse.

446
00:31:35,975 --> 00:31:40,855
No matter what bullshit you throw my way,
I'm never going to leave this school.

447
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:42,606
Fine.

448
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,730
This will be the start
of a long, long relationship.

449
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:46,277
Yeah?

450
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,903
Psycho.

451
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:52,366
And I'll make sure
to return this thing you left for me.

452
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:53,825
Yeah?

453
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:56,954
- What are you talking about?
- Huh? What?

454
00:31:57,037 --> 00:31:58,515
Are you trying to pretend
like you've lost your mind?

455
00:31:58,539 --> 00:31:59,748
Ugh, whatever...

456
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:12,261
Hey, Class President Gi Osung!

457
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:18,017
Is it true that you
and Kook Jihyun are siblings?

458
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:20,412
Is that the reason why you guys
come to school separately?

459
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:21,687
That little...

460
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:24,189
Hey, Tae Soyeon.

461
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:25,274
Watch your mouth.

462
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:27,943
Hey, I'm just genuinely curious.

463
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:29,069
Who's the older sibling?

464
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:31,131
I know there's always a younger
and older sibling even between twins.

465
00:32:31,155 --> 00:32:32,406
Didn't I tell you to stop?

466
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:34,658
Are you having fun?

467
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:36,948
Don't you have any manners?

468
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:38,579
God, that startled me.

469
00:32:38,996 --> 00:32:40,456
I'm just jealous is all.

470
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,666
You're both good students and all,

471
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,543
but why do you two
have different surnames?

472
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,964
I get that you're different genders,
but why different surnames?

473
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:52,009
You're a Gi, and she's a Kook.

474
00:32:53,135 --> 00:32:55,304
I was just curious about it.

475
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:58,015
You're usually such a show-off,

476
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:03,395
but I had no idea you two
were hiding this from everyone.

477
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:06,857
You're both pretty snobby,

478
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:09,501
but now that you guys messed up,
it kind of makes you more human.

479
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:12,379
I might even start getting fond of you.

480
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:14,365
Later.

481
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,592
Aw shit, that's good.

482
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,436
Oh.

483
00:33:44,937 --> 00:33:47,815
This is my cousin and his friend.

484
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:50,192
Hey, Sa Junggyeong,
have you lost your mind?

485
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:52,903
What are you doing visiting me at school?

486
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:55,030
Watch your tone, you piece of shit...

487
00:33:58,242 --> 00:34:00,411
Fine. I'm sorry to come looking
for you at school,

488
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:03,664
but you're not taking any action.
It was starting to make me feel antsy.

489
00:34:04,623 --> 00:34:05,833
This isn't what we agreed on.

490
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,602
I told you I'm looking into it,
so just hold on.

491
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:09,646
Ugh, how much longer? How much longer
are you going to make me wait?

492
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,670
Hey!

493
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:14,025
Didn't you promise me you'll find the guy
who did this to my foot?

494
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:17,070
Gi Osung, you're supposed to catch him.
Why haven't you done anything about that?

495
00:34:17,094 --> 00:34:18,574
Hurry up and track down that bastard.

496
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:28,188
Sa Junggyeong.

497
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:29,857
Are you out of your mind?

498
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:32,682
Are you forgetting how nervous
you used to be around me?

499
00:34:32,985 --> 00:34:34,745
Should I remind you
of how that used to feel?

500
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:38,574
Hey, little boy.
You better watch your mouth.

501
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:40,367
You're making a big mistake right now.

502
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:43,495
This toddler is all talk and no action.

503
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:45,497
- Watch it!
- Hey, hey, hey.

504
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:47,291
Don't.

505
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:54,006
What did the cops tell you?

506
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:56,759
I don't know, fuck!
They haven't told me anything.

507
00:34:56,842 --> 00:34:57,968
Those sons of bitches.

508
00:34:58,677 --> 00:34:59,720
Hey!

509
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,990
Isn't that something
you should be asking your dad?

510
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:03,098
Why are you asking me that?

511
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:05,618
Isn't that why I got so upset
and came all the way here?

512
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:07,019
Fine. Just go.

513
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:09,551
If you've transferred schools,
don't ever come back here.

514
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:17,029
Wow, that asshole pisses me off to no end.

515
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:18,530
Junggyeong.

516
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:20,866
Why are you so afraid of that little shit?

517
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:22,743
That little shit pisses me off too,

518
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:24,912
but I can't do anything to him.

519
00:35:26,288 --> 00:35:27,928
I'll get wrecked if I do anything to him.

520
00:35:28,248 --> 00:35:29,291
Fuck.

521
00:35:31,877 --> 00:35:34,713
Goal!

522
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:35,940
- Hey, you try shooting it.
- Pass it to me.

523
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:37,275
Sa Junggyeong, you've still got it.

524
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:39,259
Watch how your big brother does it, okay?

525
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:40,779
- Shoot!
- Wow, you're seriously the same.

526
00:35:40,803 --> 00:35:43,472
Shit.

527
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:45,599
Here, give it to me. Give it to me.

528
00:35:45,682 --> 00:35:47,893
Now, this is how you play basketball!

529
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:50,455
- Watch! Watch!
- Hey, hey, Junggyeong, it's your turn.

530
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,773
- Junggyeong, one more time.
- Keep it moving and woosh!

531
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:54,900
Ah, this is it.

532
00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:56,795
- That's what I'm saying! Yes!
- Did you see that?

533
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:58,546
This shit is a piece of cake,
even with a broken leg.

534
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,156
- He's really good.
- Excuse me...

535
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,658
Excuse me!

536
00:36:03,784 --> 00:36:06,120
I'm sorry, but this is our school gym.

537
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,690
You shouldn't be jumping on this floor
wearing dress shoes.

538
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:10,499
Are you kidding me?

539
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,376
Hey.

540
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,254
Why are all the punks
at this school so disrespectful?

541
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:17,047
You, come here. Say that one more time.

542
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:18,632
Huh?

543
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:20,425
Why can't we do what we're doing? Huh?

544
00:36:20,676 --> 00:36:21,676
Tell me.

545
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:24,304
Why can't we do it? Tell me.

546
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,930
Why?

547
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:27,975
This gym isn't open to just anyone.

548
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,518
This piece of shit!

549
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:31,520
Hey!

550
00:36:31,895 --> 00:36:33,605
What do you mean by anyone? Tell me!

551
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:36,066
- Anyone? You asshole.
- Please stop.

552
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:42,531
Is it part of this school's tradition
to produce disrespectful pieces of shit?

553
00:36:42,656 --> 00:36:44,783
Should we teach this guy a lesson?
Say it again.

554
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:47,828
I said, say it again,
you son of a bitch! Huh?

555
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:50,372
Why don't you just leave?

556
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,418
This motherfucker!

557
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:02,342
Are you okay?

558
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:06,263
Stay out of this.

559
00:37:06,346 --> 00:37:08,348
Say that again, you asshole!

560
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:10,809
Motherfucker, you son of a bitch!

561
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:13,020
You son of a bitch!

562
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:14,271
Die...

563
00:37:16,857 --> 00:37:18,358
You bastard. Fuck you! You...

564
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:26,867
You!

565
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:30,537
Come here. Come here. You piece of shit!

566
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:34,249
Wow, shit. Come here!

567
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,643
What are you doing, you shithead?
Get over here!

568
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,586
You son of a bitch!

569
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:43,884
Sooheon!

570
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:04,839
OK CHANMI! 5TH PERIOD
AUDITORIUM!! COME, OR ELSE!

571
00:38:04,863 --> 00:38:07,324
The auditorium fifth period...

572
00:38:07,824 --> 00:38:10,118
You're going to get in trouble again
for being late.

573
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:11,453
Hurry up and change.

574
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:16,418
Tell coach that I'm not feeling well
and that I went to the nurse's room.

575
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,085
Huh?

576
00:38:24,424 --> 00:38:25,759
Oh, right.

577
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:27,882
Isn't there supposed to be
an event for the seniors?

578
00:38:28,303 --> 00:38:30,973
Why did they insist on it
being the fifth period?

579
00:38:46,488 --> 00:38:47,688
MONK BEOBRYEON'S QUICK Q&amp;A

580
00:38:51,952 --> 00:38:55,289
MONK BEOBRYEON'S QUICK Q&amp;A
FOR SENIOR STUDENTS

581
00:38:56,832 --> 00:38:58,709
The atmosphere is very lively
at this school.

582
00:38:58,792 --> 00:38:59,793
Yes, it is.

583
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:02,480
Should I mirror your laptop screen
so that you can project your video file?

584
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:03,523
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, yes.

585
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:04,423
What's the Wifi setting?

586
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:06,186
Ah, do you mean the password for the Wifi?

587
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:13,056
MONK BEOBRYEON'S QUICK
Q&amp;A FOR SENIOR STUDENTS

588
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,226
It's my pleasure to greet
you all here at Yongtan High.

589
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,645
My name is Beobryeon.

590
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:22,899
Thank you so much for the warm welcome
and for being here today.

591
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:24,419
Now that your teenage years
are coming to an end,

592
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:26,278
you must all have quite a bit
on your plate

593
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:27,696
as students. Isn't that right?

594
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:32,075
That's why I've planned
a Q&amp;A session today.

595
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,827
So before we start the session,

596
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,039
I've prepared this video of our temple
for you all to watch today.

597
00:39:37,456 --> 00:39:39,416
In order for our emotions
to be on the same level,

598
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,960
I've prepared a beautiful
video of the four seasons.

599
00:39:42,044 --> 00:39:44,838
Let's start by watching this video.
Here we go.

600
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:01,730
What is this?

601
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:04,816
Wait, this isn't...

602
00:40:05,442 --> 00:40:06,860
- What?
- What's going on?

603
00:40:06,943 --> 00:40:08,737
Is that a guy?

604
00:40:09,404 --> 00:40:10,655
Chankyu.

605
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,494
Isn't that Park Wonseok?

606
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,538
Yeah, look!

607
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:25,712
- It's Park Wonseok!
- Isn't that him, Park Wonseok?

608
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,483
Over there, over there,
over there, over there.

609
00:40:28,507 --> 00:40:29,800
Isn't that a suicide?

610
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,718
How would I know?

611
00:40:31,802 --> 00:40:33,345
What's going on?

612
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:38,141
Did he fall off from above?

613
00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:39,810
Students, now.

614
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:42,312
You all need to go back
to your classrooms.

615
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:45,107
Head back now and watch your step...

616
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:47,025
Don't be alarmed, now.

617
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:49,069
Move out slowly.

618
00:40:51,029 --> 00:40:54,032
Don't push each other. Don't run. Now.

619
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:07,504
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

620
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:13,510
It seems like it was
taken from a cell phone.

621
00:41:13,593 --> 00:41:15,178
Considering the angle,

622
00:41:15,262 --> 00:41:17,222
it seems like it was taken
from ground level.

623
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:19,724
Because of the angle,
we can't see who pushed Park Wonseok.

624
00:41:19,808 --> 00:41:23,186
We can't see the culprit's face,
just the feet.

625
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,664
Why would this person choose
to release it now

626
00:41:24,688 --> 00:41:25,915
in front of all the other students?

627
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:27,542
Why didn't they disclose this
from the beginning?

628
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:28,626
And why would they show this
in the auditorium

629
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,526
where all the students were gathered?

630
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:31,903
So this is now a murder case,
not a suicide.

631
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:33,029
Right.

632
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:35,615
Since the murder
has been filmed and released,

633
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:38,618
I don't feel good about the fact
that all the students saw this together.

634
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:42,346
Well, the person who took it
couldn't be the culprit, could they?

635
00:41:42,873 --> 00:41:44,666
Oh, I guess they could've been
an accomplice.

636
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:47,043
Do you think Ok Chanmi
was in that auditorium too?

637
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:49,921
I hope she didn't see this.

638
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,299
It wasn't a suicide.

639
00:41:52,382 --> 00:41:54,277
He's not the type of person
who would commit suicide.

640
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:55,677
We have to catch the suspect.

641
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,512
You need to find the murderer!

642
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:00,557
Detective Hyun,

643
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,893
head over to the school to investigate

644
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:06,521
how the monk's presentation could
have been intercepted with this video.

645
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:07,957
Make sure you inspect
the network thoroughly.

646
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:10,181
Yes, ma'am, I'll make sure
no one else enters the scene.

647
00:42:11,234 --> 00:42:12,486
You don't have to go!

648
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:14,249
That's not our case. Why do you even care?

649
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,240
Why are you even watching this?

650
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:18,450
Captain!

651
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:19,951
It's a homicide case.

652
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:21,578
It doesn't concern us.

653
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:24,289
Go do your work
and find some missing kids.

654
00:42:24,372 --> 00:42:26,124
It's a homicide case, murder.

655
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:28,102
But I have prior experience
working on homicide cases.

656
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:29,479
Have you forgotten about
the serious mistake you made

657
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,863
to end up here in this department?

658
00:42:33,256 --> 00:42:34,883
Captain.

659
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:37,969
This case was assigned to us
by the criminal division.

660
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:40,323
The case was initially classified
as a cut-and-dried suicide case.

661
00:42:40,347 --> 00:42:42,325
But the problem is that
it was improperly classified and dismissed

662
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:44,076
from the beginning when it should have
been considered a homicide.

663
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,062
- We need to investigate this!
- Hey, Jin Sojung!

664
00:42:47,646 --> 00:42:49,439
You're about to cross the line.

665
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:52,525
I never meant to say

666
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,378
that the criminal division intentionally
misclassified this case.

667
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:55,487
Oh, whatever.

668
00:42:55,904 --> 00:42:58,740
Don't create any trouble!
Stop starting things!

669
00:43:13,296 --> 00:43:14,548
<i>Oh, my goodness, look!</i>

670
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:16,275
This is the case that was
previously concluded as suicide

671
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:17,610
by the women
and juvenile investigation division.

672
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:21,179
As the homicide division,
we will investigate this case quickly.

673
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:27,602
Come in.

674
00:43:30,981 --> 00:43:32,774
Did you call for me, sir?

675
00:43:33,483 --> 00:43:35,026
The video from the auditorium.

676
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:37,028
I mean, the Yongtan High homicide case.

677
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:40,112
It's a homicide case. I'll hand it over
to the homicide division right away.

678
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:43,326
- Captain Yang.
- Yes, sir.

679
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:47,330
Why do you think I've called
Detective Jin to come along with you?

680
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:48,290
Excuse me?

681
00:43:48,373 --> 00:43:50,333
- Detective Jin.
- Yes, sir.

682
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:54,004
You'll be the chief investigator
for the Yongtan High homicide.

683
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:56,501
Investigate it swiftly
and make sure you're thorough.

684
00:43:57,215 --> 00:43:59,134
Yes, sir.

685
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:31,041
OK CHANMI! 5TH PERIOD
AUDITORIUM!! COME, OR ELSE!

686
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:33,043
Who are you?

687
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:52,729
Oh...

688
00:44:57,609 --> 00:44:59,903
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

689
00:44:59,986 --> 00:45:01,696
If it's about me staying here,

690
00:45:02,238 --> 00:45:03,573
I'll be leaving soon.

691
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:05,075
No, it's not about that.

692
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,410
The coach says it's fine
for you to stay here too.

693
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:08,828
So you can just stay.

694
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:11,206
Thank you.

695
00:45:12,749 --> 00:45:15,349
I'll just be here for a few days
until I find a new place to live.

696
00:45:15,418 --> 00:45:16,544
Ah...

697
00:45:17,462 --> 00:45:19,089
I'm totally fine with it,

698
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:21,424
so just make yourself at home.

699
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:22,801
Thank you.

700
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,844
I'll head inside then.

701
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
Hey...

702
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,308
Are you sure you're okay?

703
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:31,810
What?

704
00:45:32,477 --> 00:45:34,604
What we saw in the auditorium today.

705
00:45:38,024 --> 00:45:40,902
Wasn't it just as shocking
for everyone else?

706
00:45:41,236 --> 00:45:43,029
But he's your twin brother.

707
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:46,035
The fact that you saw that
with your own eyes...

708
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:48,868
I'm fine.

709
00:45:50,745 --> 00:45:52,848
I've been imagining that scene
over and over inside my mind,

710
00:45:52,872 --> 00:45:55,083
so it's something
I was already familiar with.

711
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,004
I'm off to bed now.

712
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,464
Okay.

713
00:46:49,471 --> 00:46:50,471
Hey, Osung,

714
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:53,057
did you wait long? Sorry about that.

715
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:54,309
It's fine.

716
00:46:54,392 --> 00:46:57,312
So why did you want to meet up at night?

717
00:46:58,146 --> 00:46:59,826
You mentioned it was about the auditorium?

718
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:02,126
Did you want to talk about the video of
Park Wonseok's death?

719
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,151
Yes.

720
00:47:03,902 --> 00:47:06,488
The video at the auditorium
was very shocking.

721
00:47:07,822 --> 00:47:09,407
I wonder who was responsible for that.

722
00:47:10,408 --> 00:47:11,451
Who?

723
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:14,996
The person who killed him?
Or the person who released the video?

724
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:17,766
What? I guess I didn't realize
it would be two different people.

725
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:19,918
Well, the both of them
are sons of bitches.

726
00:47:23,922 --> 00:47:26,424
Why did you do that to Ok Chanmi?

727
00:47:29,177 --> 00:47:30,386
What?

728
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:32,347
In the auditorium.

729
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:34,307
In the auditorium?

730
00:47:35,433 --> 00:47:37,519
Huh? What do you mean, Jaebum?

731
00:47:39,229 --> 00:47:40,229
Osung.

732
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,649
If you won't be honest with me,

733
00:47:43,483 --> 00:47:45,401
then our conversation right now
is meaningless.

734
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,154
Why do you think I came here
to meet you at night?

735
00:47:49,322 --> 00:47:51,324
Jaebum, what do you mean?

736
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:53,034
What's wrong with Ok Chanmi?

737
00:47:53,618 --> 00:47:55,787
- What do you mean, at the auditorium?
- Osung.

738
00:47:57,705 --> 00:47:58,832
I'm disappointed in you.

739
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:14,861
Looks like you're not wearing them today.

740
00:48:15,557 --> 00:48:18,434
These sneakers. The ones I gifted to you.

741
00:48:18,518 --> 00:48:21,118
These are really rare in Korea
because they are a limited edition.

742
00:48:23,273 --> 00:48:24,858
Here's a better view of them.

743
00:48:38,663 --> 00:48:39,664
Osung.

744
00:48:40,373 --> 00:48:42,625
Why don't we be honest
with each other from now on?

745
00:48:42,709 --> 00:48:44,335
Why did you do that to Ok Chanmi?

746
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:45,879
You even used a brick.

747
00:48:47,297 --> 00:48:48,548
She was...

748
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:51,009
a nuisance to me.

749
00:48:51,092 --> 00:48:53,812
Hey, that's still no reason
to hit a girl over the head with a brick!

750
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:55,972
That's over the line, seriously.

751
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:58,591
That's not enough of a reason,
that she was a nuisance.

752
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:01,019
Tell me the real reason.

753
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:02,186
Jaebum!

754
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,582
You hit her head, knocked her unconscious,
and unlocked her cell phone.

755
00:49:04,606 --> 00:49:05,875
You're the one who sent
the nude photograph of Kook Jihyun

756
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:07,191
using Ok Chanmi's cell phone.

757
00:49:08,526 --> 00:49:09,861
Are you a sociopath?

758
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:11,446
- Huh?
- Ok Chanmi.

759
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:15,159
I just wanted her
to leave this school willingly.

760
00:49:15,241 --> 00:49:16,993
Why are you so afraid of her?

761
00:49:17,076 --> 00:49:18,494
I told you. I just hate her!

762
00:49:19,537 --> 00:49:21,289
She gets on my nerves.

763
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:22,665
Osung.

764
00:49:26,669 --> 00:49:27,795
Listen carefully.

765
00:49:29,464 --> 00:49:32,300
I won't tell Ok Chanmi that you're the one
who hit her over the head.

766
00:49:33,301 --> 00:49:35,511
I'll just assume she fell
on her own and move past this,

767
00:49:36,763 --> 00:49:37,889
on one condition.

768
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:41,225
Never mess with Ok Chanmi ever again.

769
00:49:42,268 --> 00:49:44,228
If you do so much as nudge her,

770
00:49:44,312 --> 00:49:47,857
I won't ever want to see you again,
and I'll release this video.

771
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:50,860
Can you keep this promise?

772
00:49:53,154 --> 00:49:54,154
Yes...

773
00:49:55,823 --> 00:49:56,991
I'll trust you.

774
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:00,536
Come on, let's go.

775
00:50:04,582 --> 00:50:06,542
I'll give you a ride home.

776
00:50:06,626 --> 00:50:08,628
Ok Chanmi really does get on my nerves!

777
00:50:10,004 --> 00:50:12,215
Do you know
why she transferred to this school?

778
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:16,594
Ok Chanmi's his twin.

779
00:50:17,595 --> 00:50:19,180
She's Park Wonseok's twin sister.

780
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:22,892
I'm serious. I saw it on her cell phone.

781
00:50:22,976 --> 00:50:24,536
I saw a photograph
of the two of them together,

782
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,062
and the messages between them.

783
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,942
Ok Chanmi is his twin sister.

784
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:44,956
COUNSELING OFFICE

785
00:50:46,332 --> 00:50:47,750
Hey, I'm off.

786
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:49,252
Okay, see you tomorrow.

787
00:50:49,335 --> 00:50:50,253
See you.

CONVENIENCE STORE

789
00:50:54,132 --> 00:50:55,717
Hey, Whitehead?

790
00:50:56,551 --> 00:51:00,179
What's wrong with you?
You were so lively earlier today.

791
00:51:00,346 --> 00:51:01,764
Quit your bullshit.

792
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,599
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

793
00:51:03,683 --> 00:51:05,727
- What is this?
- Hurry up and come with us!

794
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,812
Hey!

795
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,024
You bitch!

796
00:51:11,107 --> 00:51:13,568
Hey, hey, get up, get up, yeah.

797
00:51:13,651 --> 00:51:15,004
Look at her putting on a show.
Come here, you.

798
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:16,029
Get up now.

799
00:51:19,574 --> 00:51:21,325
Stand up.

800
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:22,660
I said, stand up!

801
00:51:22,744 --> 00:51:25,288
You!

802
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:27,915
She's so annoying!

803
00:51:45,391 --> 00:51:46,476
Jaebum!

804
00:51:46,976 --> 00:51:48,352
What are you doing there?

805
00:51:48,436 --> 00:51:51,189
Oh, Osung, hey, those sneakers up there...

806
00:51:53,441 --> 00:51:55,985
Osung, your shoes...

807
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,528
Ah.

808
00:51:57,612 --> 00:52:00,299
I wore them today because it seemed like
you were upset about it yesterday.

809
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:01,803
Anyways, what's up with the sneakers?

810
00:52:03,618 --> 00:52:05,203
What kind of lunatic did that shit?

811
00:52:06,746 --> 00:52:10,750
Jaebum, if you want to get a closer look,
it's always better to take a photo.

812
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:20,384
Huh? This is...

813
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:23,554
Huh? It's a limited edition.

814
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,848
Pretty rare in Korea.

815
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:29,769
Wow, who the hell would hang
these pricey sneakers up

816
00:52:29,852 --> 00:52:31,145
in a tree like that?

817
00:52:33,981 --> 00:52:36,150
This world is full of crazy people.

818
00:52:37,902 --> 00:52:39,362
Isn't it, Jaebum?

819
00:52:48,371 --> 00:52:50,623
- That was Park Wonseok, right?
- You mean, in the video?

820
00:52:50,706 --> 00:52:51,975
Does that mean he was killed
and that he didn't kill himself?

821
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:53,960
- Right.
- Who did that?

822
00:52:54,043 --> 00:52:56,796
I could've sworn I saw
somebody kicking him out of the window.

823
00:52:56,879 --> 00:52:59,382
I don't feel safe in this school anymore.

824
00:52:59,465 --> 00:53:00,299
TO. OK CHANMI I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW.

825
00:53:00,383 --> 00:53:01,217
SHOOTING RANGE, 1ST PERIOD

826
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,620
- Wasn't that Park Wonseok?
- Hey, stop, you're scaring me.

827
00:53:04,095 --> 00:53:06,180
Do you know someone
that knows Park Wonseok?

828
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:07,723
Who killed him?

829
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:09,100
He bullied me all semester.

830
00:53:09,725 --> 00:53:11,203
Ah, I thought he had
killed himself until yesterday,

831
00:53:11,227 --> 00:53:12,270
but now he was murdered?

832
00:53:12,353 --> 00:53:14,981
So does that mean the murderer
is still among us?

833
00:53:15,064 --> 00:53:16,566
That's what I wanted to tell you.

834
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,609
Who do you think it is?

835
00:53:18,693 --> 00:53:20,444
How did he fall from there?

836
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,073
Who did it? There was another man.

837
00:53:28,995 --> 00:53:30,705
We've received...

838
00:53:30,788 --> 00:53:32,832
an official letter
from the police department.

839
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:35,585
<i>They will investigate
the homicide case</i>

840
00:53:35,668 --> 00:53:38,963
<i>that took place at this school
during the second semester of last year.</i>

841
00:53:39,088 --> 00:53:45,178
<i>They say they'll have to investigate
the students and secure school assets.</i>

842
00:53:45,261 --> 00:53:46,780
<i>That's why we can expect
to see people here</i>

843
00:53:46,804 --> 00:53:48,848
<i>from the police department
for the time being.</i>

844
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:52,351
Baseless rumors will spread.

845
00:53:53,019 --> 00:53:56,939
To keep everyone calm
and to help them focus on their studies

846
00:53:57,023 --> 00:53:58,024
as much as possible,

847
00:53:58,107 --> 00:54:00,610
I would like to ask
for your support, everyone.

848
00:54:01,194 --> 00:54:02,570
Yes, sir.

849
00:54:09,285 --> 00:54:11,662
So are you saying that
it was technically possible

850
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:14,081
to intercept the monk's video
with another video?

851
00:54:14,165 --> 00:54:16,667
Yes, it's pretty simple to do
if you know the Wifi password.

852
00:54:17,126 --> 00:54:18,961
So that means
one of the many students here,

853
00:54:19,045 --> 00:54:23,049
who might have had the password,
could have done it?

854
00:54:23,716 --> 00:54:26,010
- Yes, that seems to be the case.
- Like this?

855
00:54:29,013 --> 00:54:30,139
If that's the case...

856
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:33,142
could anyone have access to the password?

857
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:35,394
The teachers don't have
the password memorized.

858
00:54:35,478 --> 00:54:36,747
It's written on the back of the router,

859
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:38,451
so we tend to check for it
when we need it.

860
00:54:43,486 --> 00:54:45,071
DEADLIFT

861
00:54:54,497 --> 00:54:55,998
So the person sat there

862
00:54:56,457 --> 00:54:59,585
and silently played the video
from their cell phone?

863
00:55:11,681 --> 00:55:13,224
What's for lunch today?

864
00:55:16,644 --> 00:55:17,770
What's with her?

865
00:55:21,899 --> 00:55:24,277
This lunatic...

866
00:55:26,529 --> 00:55:27,863
Did you see that?

867
00:55:27,947 --> 00:55:29,824
What's this?

868
00:55:29,907 --> 00:55:31,677
- I think I can do better than that.
- Give it a try.

869
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:33,452
Hey, one more time, one more time.

870
00:55:33,536 --> 00:55:35,329
I'm asking you one more time.

871
00:55:35,413 --> 00:55:37,748
Please don't bring up
the murder case if you can help it.

872
00:55:38,124 --> 00:55:40,060
Also, don't go around saying
this person did this,

873
00:55:40,084 --> 00:55:42,044
or that person's being suspicious.

874
00:55:42,128 --> 00:55:44,064
You might end up getting written up
in the police report

875
00:55:44,088 --> 00:55:46,358
even if you were just joking around,
so don't spread any baseless rumors.

876
00:55:46,382 --> 00:55:48,467
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

877
00:55:48,551 --> 00:55:50,678
- And Ok Chanmi.
- Yes?

878
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:52,072
Chanmi, don't go
to your first period class,

879
00:55:52,096 --> 00:55:53,198
and head to the counseling office instead.

880
00:55:53,222 --> 00:55:56,017
- During the first period?
- Yes, you should go now.

881
00:56:00,396 --> 00:56:02,940
They set up a temporary police office
in the counseling office.

882
00:56:03,774 --> 00:56:06,374
But this all happened before
Ok Chanmi transferred, so what gives?

883
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:23,377
COUNSELING OFFICE

884
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,014
The bell rang a while ago
and she's still not here.

885
00:56:35,097 --> 00:56:36,349
PATH/FUTURE JOURNAL

886
00:56:36,432 --> 00:56:39,432
Maybe we put too much pressure on her
by summoning her as the first witness?

887
00:56:41,604 --> 00:56:42,813
The homeroom teacher told me

888
00:56:42,897 --> 00:56:44,648
he was going to tell Ok Chanmi
to come here.

889
00:56:48,235 --> 00:56:51,947
Maybe Ok Chanmi is already too deep
into the case?

890
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:47,503
TO. OK CHANMI I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW

891
00:57:47,586 --> 00:57:48,626
SHOOTING RANGE, 1ST PERIOD
