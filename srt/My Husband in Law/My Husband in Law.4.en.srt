1
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
Whoa! What are you doing?

2
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,000
They're real soulmates.

3
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,360
- Let me. - Whoa!

4
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,599
Thian, No!

5
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,160
If I force my husband to sleep with me,

6
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,480
which law will I have to break?

7
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,720
Moei.

8
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,999
I know you aren't that stupid

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,119
not knowing how she feels about you.

10
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,160
Mom.

11
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
Moei isn't a girl I love.

12
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,600
Moei, what the heck are you playing?

13
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,840
You want to catch a cold?

14
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,799
- I ordered you to read, not set them aside. - I will.

15
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
This is just the beginning.

16
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,600
If you want to work with me,

17
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,600
you have to be hard-working and patient.

18
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,839
How can you get in here?

19
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Look. I bought your favorite.

20
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,960
I got some for your wife too.

21
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,680
I'll do anything.

22
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,520
I can even be your mistress.

23
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,760
Hey.

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
Why are you so stubborn?

25
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
It's because I love you.

26
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,160
No, Yada.

27
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,480
Yada. Stop it.

28
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Yada.

29
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,920
Stop it.

30
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,720
Get out.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,560
We're happily married.

32
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,880
My wife wouldn't like it

33
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,920
if you came here again.

34
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,760
It's over. You should leave.

35
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,720
I don't believe

36
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,520
that you and this kid

37
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,760
are a real couple.

38
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
How about now?

39
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
Do I need to prove again?

40
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,120
Moei.

41
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,240
Moei.

42
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,240
Thanks.

43
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,480
Don't get ahead of yourself, Moei.

44
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,360
Never forget why you're here.

45
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,200
You're just a body-shield.

46
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,880
Got it?

47
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Snow.

48
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,000
Have you eaten?

49
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,200
Where's your boss?

50
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,640
Why did she leave hungry?

51
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,880
Is she mad at me?

52
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,680
Maybe she jumped off a bridge and died.

53
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
No, Moei wouldn't be that stupid.

54
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,440
(Where are you? Why aren't you at work?)

55
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,440
Where are you?

56
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,240
Why aren't you at work?

57
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,480
She must have run away.

58
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,920
Did you do something to upset her?

59
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,600
You're so right. I bet he did.

60
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,200
I didn't. Damn you.

61
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,440
Believe him?

62
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,520
Why so many group chats?

63
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,920
I sent it to wrong group.

64
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,480
You have 15 minutes.

65
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,280
If you don't show up, you're in trouble.

66
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,359
You're good.

67
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,960
You managed to contact me.

68
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,400
I only searched your name on Facebook.

69
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,000
Say what you came to say.

70
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,360
Leave my husband alone.

71
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,680
I believe de made it very clear last night.

72
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,840
You just kissed.

73
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,040
Thian and I have done so much more.

74
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,440
How do you know

75
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,000
that Thian and I have only kissed?

76
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,240
You're not with us 24 hours.

77
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,120
And stop telling me what wild things

78
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,720
you and Thian have done.

79
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,159
That's all in the past.

80
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,840
Right now,

81
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,280
I'm his lawful wife.

82
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,160
I guess I don't need to put up a sign

83
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,880
announcing who exactly owns Thian.

84
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,080
I'm warning you for the last time.

85
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,080
Don't ever come to our house again.

86
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,559
I won't just call the police next time,

87
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,800
I'll throw boiling water on you too.

88
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,880
It's time for you to open your eyes.

89
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Pull yourself together.

90
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Where are you?

91
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,920
Yes, Chet.

92
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm ready.

93
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,160
Based on Hammoc's performance during the past few weeks,

94
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,760
it's likely the profits won't meet our expectations.

95
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,640
We need to have the board vote on it.

96
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,840
What the Hammoc's future shall be,

97
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
let the majority of the board decide.

98
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,520
Don't we have other ways, Thian?

99
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,800
No one wants this to happen, Chet.

100
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,120
But this is how business goes.

101
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,360
I'll take care of it from this point forward.

102
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,760
Please keep this a secret for the time being.

103
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
All right.

104
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,400
- What's going on with Thian's computer? - I don't know.

105
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
What are these weird characters?

106
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't do anything with it.

107
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,200
Move. Let me pass.

108
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,040
- I can't reboot it. - What do we do?

109
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,119
What's happening?

110
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,640
We wanted to show you something,

111
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,440
but this is what we found.

112
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,280
Look.

113
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,040
Some weird characters are running.

114
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,200
I stole…

115
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,960
Your files…

116
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
Thian.

117
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,879
Your computer's been hacked.

118
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,999
- Hacked? - What?

119
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,040
Yes.

120
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,440
- But... yeah. - Where did it go?

121
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,960
Where did it go?

122
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,280
Does it mean...

123
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,320
someone really hacked into our internal database?

124
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,359
It's a type of spyware called Keylocker

125
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,240
which was sent to Thian's inbox.

126
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,080
When Thian clicked on it,

127
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,680
the program started running.

128
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,840
Everything you typed in

129
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,280
was sent to the hacker.

130
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,880
That's how he found out your log-in and password.

131
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,920
Wow.

132
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,680
That's high-tech.

133
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,280
Could you retrieve all the files?

134
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,960
Damn.

135
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,960
- Did you hear? - Hey.

136
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,879
Is it true Thian's computer was hacked?

137
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,600
- Yes. - Yes.

138
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,920
Will it affect our company?

139
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh my god.

140
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,599
Something bad has happened.

141
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,040
- What is it? - What? What is it?

142
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,640
A computer in Architect Department was hacked.

143
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,319
- I heard they lost all their data. - Oh, god.

144
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,040
I see now. Karma is getting Thian once and for all.

145
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,559
- Is that right? - Of course!

146
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,600
What's the situation?

147
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,800
The hacker only got Thian's computer.

148
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,200
What important information did it hold?

149
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,160
It had the project bidding against TW and the Dawei project.

150
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,000
Can't the files be retrieved?

151
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,720
I'm trying to find a way to retrieve them.

152
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,880
Retrieve the Dawei project first.

153
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,080
Do the best you can.

154
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,400
- We need to submit it to the engineers. - Yes.

155
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,680
It never happened in our company before.

156
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,680
- I know. - What should we do?

157
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,240
We're keeping an eye on Thada.

158
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,960
He's also a shareholder of TW, our competitor.

159
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Tomorrow at 10, you have a meeting with the shareholders at TPC.

160
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,880
In the afternoon,

161
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,120
you are meeting with Mr. Chumpon regarding the concession.

162
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,880
Hello, Mr. Thada.

163
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,040
I am Natheerin.

164
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,720
Don't leave just yet.

165
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,800
I'm Thiarawat's wife.

166
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,640
I know what you want.

167
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,920
You know what I want.

168
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,240
What about you?

169
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,360
I can't tell you now.

170
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,320
After you succeed in the auction,

171
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,160
you can then contact me

172
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,480
and we can talk.

173
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,680
By the way,

174
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,480
I left my name card in your suit pocket.

175
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,559
What have you got?

176
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,040
Your department's cameras went down for 20 minutes.

177
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,440
Can I see the footage at the hallway?

178
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,560
Of course.

179
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,760
Oh.

180
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,920
Oh, it's you.

181
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,680
I'm sorry I didn't see you.

182
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,320
When will you stop this mind game?

183
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,840
I chased you away and insulted you, but you won't give up.

184
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,520
Please tell me what I have to do

185
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,280
for you to leave me alone.

186
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,680
Jeez.

187
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,600
You're so mean.

188
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,560
I can be even meaner.

189
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Karma will soon get you for being mean to me.

190
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,280
Good luck with that.

191
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,799
That is so obvious.

192
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,080
It must be Yada's doing.

193
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,400
- Let's get her. What are we waiting for? - Whoa.

194
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,759
This is all the footage we have. It's not evidence.

195
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,240
We can't do anything.

196
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,880
- Beer. - Hmm?

197
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,440
From now on, stand guard at our department

198
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,480
and keep your eye out for Yada.

199
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,960
- Got it. - Nott.

200
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,640
- Yes. - Retrieve the security footage as soon as possible.

201
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,959
- Toon. - Yes.

202
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
Keep an eye on Yada and report back to me.

203
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,080
Okay.

204
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,600
I have to catch her red-handed.

205
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,680
- Do you think Yada is behind it? - Yes.

206
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,280
I saw Yada leaving our department

207
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,760
near the time of the incident.

208
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,440
We should persuade Mr. Thada to sell his shares

209
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,920
as soon as possible.

210
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,680
I know you made Moei as your assistant.

211
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,640
But I don't think that's enough.

212
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,440
I think it's more than enough.

213
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm doing everything, but Yada won't leave me alone.

214
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,880
I'm not asking you for a favor.

215
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,680
This is an order.

216
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,560
You and Moei need to be clingier.

217
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,080
Only then will Mr. Thada completely believe

218
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,280
that he will never have you no matter how hard

219
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,240
he throws his daughter at you.

220
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,400
- He'll leave you alone. - But Mr. Baramee...

221
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,240
This is no longer a personal matter, Thian.

222
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,440
The company is at stake now.

223
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,680
Hey.

224
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
Where have you been?

225
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,000
I went to the temple to get rid of bad luck.

226
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,720
Did you consider my kiss a bad luck?

227
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,040
What kiss?

228
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,960
Get back to work.

229
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,000
(Hammoc Employee Evaluations)

230
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,920
They are closing down Hammoc?

231
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,840
How do you expect me to calm down?

232
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,880
If they close down the company, that means

233
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,320
I will be unemployed.

234
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,880
It might not be true.

235
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,360
I have bills piling up, you know, for my house,

236
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,360
for my car,

237
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,760
and my life insurance fee.

238
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,640
Come on. Please don't cry.

239
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Tum.

240
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,200
What's going on?

241
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,040
This is a big deal.

242
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,000
You can't tell anyone for the time being.

243
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,840
It could lead to chaos.

244
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,360
Kob. Tum.

245
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,000
Is it true Hammoc will be closing down?

246
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,720
How did you find out?

247
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,760
I overheard you, Tum, and Moei.

248
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,040
Is it true?

249
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,840
- Chad! - What?

250
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,120
Tell us right now.

251
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,000
Is our company going bankrupt?

252
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,360
Wait.

253
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,520
Is Hammoc going bankrupt?

254
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
How did you know?

255
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,680
Well…

256
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Well…

257
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,800
Moei.

258
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,400
- Come here. - Wait, Thian.

259
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,960
What's the rush?

260
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,080
We may fall down the stairs.

261
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,640
Oh.

262
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,200
Did you look in my folder?

263
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,840
I didn't mean everyone to find out.

264
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,920
You didn't mean it and it caused so much trouble.

265
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Gosh!

266
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to.

267
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,520
By the way,

268
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,880
Are you really closing down Hammoc?

269
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,960
Moei.

270
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,880
I don't have the power to close down Hammoc.

271
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,840
Mr. Baramee and the board are the ones with the power.

272
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,200
Tell your friends

273
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,319
that instead of making a fuss about it,

274
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,680
they should work harder

275
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,080
or do whatever it takes

276
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,160
to prove we shouldn't close Hammoc down.

277
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Yes.

278
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,040
Please be quiet.

279
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,480
I'd like you all to do one thing.

280
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,680
Export all important files out of your computer.

281
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,080
Don't keep them in one place.

282
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,640
How did it happen, Thian?

283
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,879
It has never

284
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,320
happened in our company before.

285
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,519
He's right.

286
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,880
We have tight security.

287
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,240
Exactly.

288
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,679
How did it happen?

289
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,080
All this time, everything has always been

290
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,160
peaceful in TPC.

291
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,360
Excuse me.

292
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,640
Excuse me.

293
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Hey.

294
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,439
It's her I was telling you looking down on Moei and us the other day.

295
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,560
It's her.

296
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,080
All Hammoc staff,

297
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,720
I'd like to introduce you to Kaofang.

298
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,040
She's an accountant

299
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,760
who will be helping you all.

300
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,720
Excuse me.

301
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,800
Why do we need her

302
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,320
since I am Hammoc's accountant?

303
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
Yes. Why?

304
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,320
Because all of you work for our company.

305
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,479
What do you mean?

306
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,720
I don't get it.

307
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,000
- We already have Goong. - That's right.

308
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,240
They don't trust us, that's why.

309
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,480
Am I right, Mr. Thiarawat?

310
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,600
I see…

311
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,040
you were Hammoc's former head

312
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,480
of the interior department.

313
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,240
You were saying

314
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,040
everything had been peaceful all this time.

315
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,600
You're implying

316
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,720
"until the day Hammoc joined us"?

317
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,200
You think we're responsible for your computer being hacked.

318
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,800
Don't be too alarmed.

319
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
You don't need to say.

320
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,080
It's obvious what's on your mind.

321
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,879
You're pressuring us to resign, aren't you?

322
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,360
If I wanted you to resign,

323
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,000
I would have presented your performance to the board.

324
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,920
All of you would have been fired.

325
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That's right.

326
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,160
I am sure you all are aware

327
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,320
of how bad the situation of your company is.

328
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,160
I only need to examine.

329
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
And it's only fair

330
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,720
that the examiner is not someone from your company.

331
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,360
- Kaofang. - Yes.

332
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,000
- Take a seat. - Yes.

333
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,000
What should I do, Kang?

334
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,360
If Hammoc really closes down,

335
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,240
will I be able to find a new job?

336
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,719
Come here. It will be okay. There, there.

337
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,680
I guess you should be prepared for the worst though.

338
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,680
Is your messed-up childhood the reason you like stepping on others?

339
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,480
How inhumanly cruel.

340
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,120
You really have no sympathy for those who are struggling.

341
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,719
I'm not stepping on anyone.

342
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,359
I only want you to accept the truth.

343
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
What truth?

344
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,920
You can't count then chickens before they're hatched.

345
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,520
We're tough. We won't go down easily.

346
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,440
If this is how you comfort yourselves,

347
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,000
be my guest.

348
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,960
Anyway,

349
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,080
keep up, will you?

350
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,760
Right.

351
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,000
You can do it!

352
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,120
"You can do it", your ass. Leave already.

353
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,520
I had you looked up.

354
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,120
I was quite surprised

355
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,280
you're capable than I thought.

356
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,000
How much do you want?

357
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,240
Name your price.

358
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,120
I haven't thought about it.

359
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,120
It won't be cheap though.

360
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,880
That won't be a problem.

361
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,240
Besides the money, however,

362
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,840
I also need something from you.

363
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,080
What is it?

364
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,240
Right now, Hammoc,

365
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,040
the company I'm working for,

366
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,080
is about to be closed down by TPC.

367
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,399
If I can get a hold of TPC's classified intel for you,

368
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,440
you have to keep Hammoc running.

369
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
Do we have a deal?

370
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,680
I can easily make it happen.

371
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,160
I can persuade the board to keep your company.

372
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,320
You're doing this, however,

373
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,080
won't that mean you're becoming enemies with your husband?

374
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,400
Who said I married him because of love?

375
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,120
Your daughter

376
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
is to blame for this.

377
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,760
I had to sacrifice my single life

378
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,960
to marry Thian,

379
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,400
the man I don't love.

380
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,080
I am really surprised hearing this.

381
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Very well.

382
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,160
Since you're being straightforward,

383
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,800
so I will.

384
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,040
We are now officially

385
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,840
partners, Ms. Natheerin.

386
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,320
I'm not done.

387
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,560
There's one more thing.

388
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
I need from you.

389
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,920
But you have to keep this between us.

390
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,160
Keep your daughter away from my office,

391
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,040
and Thian.

392
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,640
To be honest,

393
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,720
I'm afraid that your daughter might ruin our plan.

394
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,600
It's a deal.

395
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,200
If you care so much about her,

396
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
why don't you take her home and babysit her?

397
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,200
I would have if she wasn't married.

398
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,120
How about now?

399
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,160
Do I need to prove it again?

400
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,920
I brought you home

401
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,720
yet you went out and caused trouble.

402
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,840
You're such a mess.

403
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,760
I guess Thian rejected you again.

404
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,960
Right?

405
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,599
You're so shameless.

406
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,120
I've never met anyone as shameless as you.

407
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,160
- Hey. - It hurts!

408
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,400
He even married a girl to get away from you,

409
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,480
but you still keep throwing yourself at him.

410
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,200
How pathetic.

411
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,440
You make me so sick.

412
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,440
I don't even want to breathe the same air.

413
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,440
I'll say this for the last time.

414
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,040
Let's go separate way.

415
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,440
I sure won't forget

416
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,200
to pray for you.

417
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,920
Wait.

418
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,320
Wait.

419
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,240
Thian.

420
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Thian.

421
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
I wonder

422
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,640
how long you think you can

423
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,880
ignore me.

424
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,240
I'm sure

425
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,040
you will be mine eventually.

426
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,880
Do you miss him that badly?

427
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Fine.

428
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,280
I'll give you a night you never forget.

429
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,640
Thian.

430
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Pon.

431
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,760
What did you do to me?

432
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,760
So you really can't remember a thing.

433
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,000
To be honest,

434
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,960
you're still as good as ever

435
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,960
even though we haven't slept together for some time.

436
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,680
You took advantage of me.

437
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,760
Did I really?

438
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,479
I suggest you think again

439
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,200
who started it last night.

440
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Thian.

441
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Thian.

442
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
I wonder

443
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,320
how long you think you can ignore me.

444
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
So?

445
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,880
Remember it now?

446
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,160
- Hmm? - Let go.

447
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,600
Let me go.

448
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,119
Want some more? Hmm?

449
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,960
Let go. Let go of me!

450
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,560
Get off of me!

451
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,000
You scum!

452
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,200
Evil prick!

453
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,360
Get out!

454
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,839
- Everyone is going. - It's your treat today.

455
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,039
- What the heck? Didn't you win the lottery? - Come on.

456
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,480
- Can I have 15 minutes? - Damn it.

457
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,440
I'd like to inform you all about upcoming projects this year.

458
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,200
- Must he do this now? It's lunch time - I'm hungry.

459
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,160
My stomach is growling.

460
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,840
I'm manly enough

461
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,160
not to take advantage of you.

462
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,120
I chose this time because I knew all of you would be here.

463
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,560
It won't take long.

464
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,040
I understand all of you've attended the company's orientation.

465
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,400
So you should know that our company operates all processes

466
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,960
from designing to construction.

467
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,160
Therefore, interior designers

468
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,040
will be divided into teams

469
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,960
to work on different projects accordingly.

470
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,160
This is a chance for you to prove

471
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,440
whether Hammoc should stay or leave.

472
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,120
What? What the hell?

473
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,640
Wait, Mr. Thiarawat.

474
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,840
I need to talk to you.

475
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,440
- Go ahead. - Normally, at Hammoc,

476
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,640
we work together as one big team.

477
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,560
We've never been split up before.

478
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,960
- So if I'd like to ask... - You can't.

479
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,240
You're aware of the current situation.

480
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,280
I'm actually giving all of you a chance.

481
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,080
I don't think you're in position to negotiate.

482
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,040
If you want to give us a chance,

483
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,400
you should give us time to adjust.

484
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,120
Hammoc and TPC employees work differently.

485
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,440
Kob, Hammoc and TPC are one now.

486
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,640
You're one of our many legs.

487
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,640
Why would we keep the leg if it's dysfunctional?

488
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
You have always been inside a safe zone,

489
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,400
but this is a battlefield.

490
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,280
Only fighters can survive.

491
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
Got it?

492
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,120
If you think you can bully us like you did to Moei, you're wrong.

493
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,680
What did I do?

494
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,680
Something gentlemen would never do.

495
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,760
Are you confused about something here?

496
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,760
This is a workplace,

497
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,760
not a kindergarten where you nurse little children.

498
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,480
If you care so much about her,

499
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,120
why don't you take her home and babysit her?

500
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,120
I would have if she wasn't married.

501
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,960
You like her?

502
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,040
I'd better not see you bully us or Moei again.

503
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,000
Even the nicest people have their limits.

504
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,079
- Tum, have you seen Kob? - No.

505
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,680
- Have you? - No.

506
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,560
- Goong, have you seen Kob? - No.

507
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,080
Where did he go? He's been gone for a while.

508
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,880
He went after Thian long ago. He's not yet back.

509
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,120
Did your husband push him off the building?

510
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,640
That's crazy.

511
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,600
Well, he's scary.

512
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,560
I knew you would be here.

513
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,160
Here. It will freshen you up.

514
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,120
- Thanks. - Sure.

515
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,320
Tum told me everything.

516
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,360
But you need to be patient.

517
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,480
Do I look impatient?

518
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,400
Well, that's what it seems to me.

519
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,280
I'm thinking of a way to deal with Thiarawat.

520
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,560
He may want to change the way we work,

521
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,840
but I will prove to him

522
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,160
how talented we all are.

523
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,720
You're the best.

524
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,639
If there's anything I can help,

525
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,880
please let me know.

526
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,080
Here you are.

527
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,280
I have a late meeting today.

528
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,600
You can leave without me.

529
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,840
Okay.

530
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Right.

531
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
Thian.

532
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,839
Don't forget to change your password

533
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,280
or you might get hacked again.

534
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,840
I will.

535
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Okay.

536
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,520
Hello?

537
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,920
Are you Ms. Natheerin?

538
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,920
Yes.

539
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm Matthana,

540
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,440
Mr. Thada's secretary.

541
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,440
We agree to keep our end of the deal.

542
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,640
- What's the matter? What's wrong? - Damn it.

543
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,120
Whoa.

544
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,240
Thian.

545
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,160
You think I was going to jump?

546
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,600
- What's the matter? What's wrong? - Damn it.

547
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,880
What's the matter, Thian?

548
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,640
This...

549
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,840
was on my screen.

550
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,080
Oh, it's long. You read it.

551
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,760
Gosh. Give me that. I'll read it.

552
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,200
"Only you can stop this game.

553
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,280
Come back to me

554
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,000
then I'll make it over,

555
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
my love.

556
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
I know you still remember that night

557
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,600
that we belonged together."

558
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,280
"That night that we belonged together"?

559
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,160
"That night that we belonged together."

560
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,600
I know, Thian.

561
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,000
Try to remember who you've slept with recently.

562
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,199
Moei, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to say it.

563
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,760
It's okay.

564
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,880
- I'm sorry. - Thian.

565
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,319
Thian, this is bad.

566
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
What is it?

567
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,439
Your building design showed up in another company.

568
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
What?

569
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,280
How come?

570
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,040
It really looks

571
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,880
99.99% similar to yours.

572
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,000
It's obvious that's your design.

573
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,280
They only made minor changes.

574
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,919
Don't tell me it showed up at...

575
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,040
TW.

576
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,120
Mr. Thada is a shareholder there.

577
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,920
That's obvious.

578
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,000
We saw Yada on the security footage.

579
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,840
And now TW has your design.

580
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,840
It's clear who's behind this.

581
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,520
My boss is satisfied with the master plan you sent us.

582
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,320
We didn't expect you to move this quickly.

583
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,960
Thank you.

584
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,160
I hope Mr. Thada

585
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
will keep his end of the deal.

586
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,280
The first half of the money

587
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,120
will be transferred to you tomorrow.

588
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,520
But right now, my boss

589
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,720
wants his hands on the project's BOQ

590
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,600
which TPC will use for the upcoming auction.

591
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,439
This is probably the last favor

592
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,440
we'll ask from you.

593
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,920
Then we will keep our end of the deal.

594
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,200
It won't be easy.

595
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,680
Piece of information that important

596
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,400
is only kept on the company's main server.

597
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,160
I can't use an employee's computer to hack into it.

598
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,519
The IT department will be able to identify

599
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,760
the ID of the computer used.

600
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,320
Are you saying you can't do it?

601
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,800
No.

602
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,960
I'm saying I need more time to prepare.

603
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,120
I don't want to leave any traces.

604
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,360
I understand.

605
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,640
But my boss needs it ASAP

606
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,360
and his words are final.

607
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,960
I hope you understand.

608
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,960
Moei.

609
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,360
What's so urgent

610
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,640
that you called us in the middle of the night?

611
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,200
As far as I know,

612
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,720
the board adjusted the company's structure

613
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,640
and…

614
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,640
Hammoc is not on the list.

615
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,000
- What? - What did you say?

616
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,400
Didn't Thian say he would give us a chance to prove ourselves?

617
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,400
This means he lied to us.

618
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,200
What a prick. He made himself look good,

619
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,960
but he knew we would be fired in the end.

620
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,520
So I guess you already have a solution. Am I right?

621
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,360
Yes.

622
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,200
Someone made me a deal

623
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,360
in exchange for keeping Hammoc in business.

624
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,880
Is this why you summoned this meeting?

625
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Yes.

626
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,520
Who did you make the deal with?

627
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,039
Mr. Thada.

628
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,400
Do you mean Mr. Thada, TPC's new shareholder?

629
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
Yes.

630
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,240
What do you have to do?

631
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,680
I have to get a piece of information

632
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,320
and give it to him.

633
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,280
What information?

634
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,760
You don't need to worry about that.

635
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,560
I'll take care of it.

636
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,880
That means you are stealing information.

637
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,880
Just like what happened to Thiarawat.

638
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,720
Are you saying

639
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,080
the hacker who hacked Thian's computer…

640
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,719
It was me.

641
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,760
Moei.

642
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,000
If he finds out, oh my god,

643
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,919
you'll be thrown into jail.

644
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,280
No. No way. I'm not okay with that.

645
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,439
Hang on, Tum.

646
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,800
Don't you trust me?

647
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,320
You know I'm good at this.

648
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,720
No one will ever find out.

649
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,720
Yeah, you are.

650
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,320
However,

651
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,240
I can't do this alone.

652
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,280
That's why I need your help.

653
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,360
But if you are too scared,

654
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,440
I understand.

655
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,640
I won't force you.

656
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,080
I'll do it.

657
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,880
Thank you, Kob.

658
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,720
I'll do anything

659
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,680
to keep Hammoc in business.

660
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,720
Okay, let's do it.

661
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,000
All right, I'm in.

662
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,480
We are all in now.

663
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,960
Let's complete this mission together.

664
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,520
What an adrenaline rush!

665
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,760
You're right, Kang.

666
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,560
Well, well, well.

667
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,920
He acted all powerful.

668
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,760
- But his data got stolen. - It serves him right.

669
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,519
Think about it. There are hundreds of employees,

670
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,840
but only he got hit.

671
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,960
This is clearly the work of God.

672
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,360
Keep your voice and laughter down, will you?

673
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,080
Why? Is someone eavesdropping?

674
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,879
Because if you make me laugh,

675
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,480
we might end up breaking every glass on this table.

676
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,480
This feels so great.

677
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,760
Stop it already.

678
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,960
Stop what? I know you're happy too.

679
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,159
- They say never hit a man when he is down. - Wait.

680
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,319
Old sayings are old-fashioned. Both of you are.

681
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,400
But I guess.

682
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,640
Thiarawat is having a hard time right now.

683
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,240
Doesn't he deserve it?

684
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,799
Now he can stop being cocky.

685
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,160
I actually wish…

686
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,720
for something worse to happen to him.

687
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,040
Keep it down. He's right there.

688
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,080
Whoa.

689
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,040
Do you think you can take me down by doing this?

690
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,640
Never.

691
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,840
I will soon prove

692
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,800
that you're wrong.

693
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,240
Go away.

694
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,280
Go away.

695
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,480
Go away.

696
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,560
Whoa.

697
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Moei.

698
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,200
Who were you talking to?

699
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,040
To myself.

700
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,880
- To yourself? - So what?

701
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,520
- What do you want? - Nothing.

702
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,520
I was just worried about you.

703
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,480
You were gone for too long so I came here to find you.

704
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,440
Whoa!

705
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,600
You think I was going to jump?

706
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,920
Are you crazy?

707
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,800
I didn't expect you to be suicidal either.

708
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,920
I would never hurt myself for a woman like Yada.

709
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,520
That's good.

710
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,160
Upon hearing that,

711
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,880
I feel more at ease.

712
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,120
By the way,

713
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,520
what are you going to do now?

714
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,120
Would you like some wine?

715
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,800
I don't want wine.

716
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,680
I want something else.

717
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,760
Be patient.

718
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,760
We need a foreplay.

719
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,760
You should know very well.

720
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,080
I don't need

721
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,920
any foreplay.

722
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,640
We have plenty of time.

723
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,960
A little patience

724
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,000
may lead to something better.

725
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,600
Here.

726
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,720
There he goes.

727
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,640
How many glasses will it take

728
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,120
for Yada to get drunk?

729
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,760
But Thian said she was a lightweight.

730
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,000
- A few drinks should do it. - I see.

731
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,480
Hopefully, Thian can make Yada confess.

732
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,880
Let me.

733
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,280
Are you trying to get me drunk?

734
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,440
You're cute when you're drunk.

735
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,600
Thian.

736
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,280
You're such a sweet talker.

737
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,440
This is why I can't get over you.

738
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,480
You know,

739
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,480
I was really happy

740
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,360
when you said you wanted to see me.

741
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,440
What changed your mind?

742
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,560
Since you seemed

743
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,520
to hate me earlier.

744
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,240
Hmm?

745
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,560
Well...

746
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,200
I'm the same as you, I guess.

747
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,640
The truth is I can't get over you either.

748
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,400
How about...

749
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,160
I give you a huge present tonight?

750
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,600
There she goes.

751
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,840
You spilled it all, man.

752
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,840
- Stop it. - Are you sure he is there

753
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,520
just to seek confession?

754
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,080
Shush! It's about to reach the climax.

755
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,360
Oh, Thian is such a badass.

756
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,040
What are you saying?

757
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,120
Wait.

758
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,360
What prank are you pulling?

759
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,520
You're suddenly speaking English to me.

760
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,800
Are you up to something? Hmm?

761
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,040
Hang on.

762
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,520
You sent me a note.

763
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,600
- Don't you remember? - Me?

764
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,600
That wasn't me.

765
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,320
You gotta tell me right now

766
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,560
which girl sent you a note

767
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,960
to flirt with you.

768
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,160
- Don't you know anything about it? - No.

769
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,400
Tell me right now.

770
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,800
Who else are you secretly dating besides me?

771
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,040
- What? - No.

772
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,600
Thian.

773
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,520
Come on, tell me.

774
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,080
Thian.

775
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,120
Thian.

776
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,279
- That was so close. - Hey.

777
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,000
- Hey. - So it wasn't Yada?

778
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,400
You saw her.

779
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,080
She didn't know anything.

780
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,920
Could she be acting?

781
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,240
She's too drunk for that.

782
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,840
Besides, she looked at me

783
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,200
all confused.

784
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,920
Oh, man.

785
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,560
If it wasn't Yada, who was it then?

786
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,879
Thian, think carefully.

787
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,840
Did you break anyone else's heart besides Yada's?

788
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,960
Yeah.

789
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,200
Think carefully.

790
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,240
Did you sleep with someone else?

791
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,160
Any other girls you didn't tell us about?

792
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,280
You didn't sleep with Gie, did you?

793
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,800
I'm just asking.

794
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,400
Thian.

795
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,000
You're home.

796
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,720
- Yes. - Have you eaten?

797
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,280
I have.

798
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,760
Why sleeping here? Go to bed.

799
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,200
What is this for?

800
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,000
Well, it's an energy drink.

801
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,440
I see that. I'm not blind.

802
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,600
Why are you giving it to me?

803
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,880
I know you're going to pull an all-nighter

804
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,080
for tomorrow's presentation.

805
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,320
And all of your work

806
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,160
were stolen.

807
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,680
Now you have to do it again.

808
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,400
So I brought you this

809
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,560
to keep you energized.

810
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,400
You seem to know everything.

811
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,840
Did Beer tell you this?

812
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,240
That is correct.

813
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,360
I wish you were this energetic at work.

814
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,600
Come on, Thian.

815
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,519
Your desk and mine are so close

816
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,319
that we nearly share the same desk.

817
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,520
I can see everything you do.

818
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,080
Here.

819
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,960
No, wait.

820
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,240
We need a toast.

821
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,480
Why?

822
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,520
- This has nothing to do with you. - What?

823
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,960
Of course, it does. I'm your assistant.

824
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,280
You aren't sleeping, neither will I.

825
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,560
We have to help each other.

826
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,800
Come on. Cheers.

827
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,120
Are you going to speed things up or slow me down?

828
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,880
It's me, Moei, of course, I'll speed things up. Come on.

829
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,920
Thian, aren't you drinking too fast?

830
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,040
Ready now?

831
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,320
So ready.

832
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,880
Let's do it.

833
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:12,000
(The security cameras will shut down in one minute.)

834
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,440
I know you're exhausted.

835
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,320
But please keep going.

836
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,760
(The security cameras will shut down in one minute.)

837
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,760
Wait.

838
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,000
The cameras are down again.

839
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,200
What?

840
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,320
It happened too often these days.

841
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,000
Yeah. Something seems off.

842
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,840
Okay. I'll check over there.

843
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,040
- Yes. I'll check over here again. - Okay.

844
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,760
You got hacked today.

845
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,000
You'll realize it again tomorrow.

846
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,560
I really feel bad for you, Thian.

847
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,160
He changed the password?

848
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,439
What is it, Moei?

849
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,720
Can you give me the new password?

850
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,040
Okay. Hold on.

851
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,760
Our next plan

852
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,800
is to install a program

853
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,800
that will allow me

854
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,760
to use my computer

855
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,400
to control his.

856
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,720
We need to hide the program somewhere

857
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,360
so he can't see it.

858
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,520
Once the program runs,

859
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,000
we'll be able to see everything via the internet

860
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,600
without risking going inside the office.

861
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,960
We need to reinstall a certain spyware

862
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,320
to have access to the new password.

863
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,560
The latest order we got

864
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,200
was to penetrate the company's server

865
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,640
which is very difficult.

866
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,320
We need several distant hacking methods,

867
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,840
in case things go wrong.

868
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,399
We'll be notified

869
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,200
when the IT department realizes that something is wrong.

870
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,000
I don't know how effective this plan will be.

871
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,120
All I know is Thian's computer

872
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,000
will have the honor of being our first guinea pig.

873
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,600
What are you doing?

874
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,560
Nothing.

875
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,360
I just…

876
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,840
I brought you some apples.

877
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,720
Thanks.

878
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,040
You're sleepy, aren't you?

879
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,280
Have some.

880
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,440
I'm too sleepy to eat.

881
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,000
Come on. It will wake you up.

882
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,240
Here. One more.

883
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,040
Too close maybe?

884
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,680
Am I ?

885
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,360
Moei.

886
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,360
Moei.

887
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,240
I know you're exhausted.

888
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,200
But please keep going.

889
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,920
I'll be right here cheering for you.

890
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,600
You're laughing.

891
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,640
You're sleep-laughing.

892
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,120
Only if you accept the love from me,

893
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,280
Love you, my Silly Boy.

894
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,320
Let me see your face, Silly Boy.

895
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,720
Cyber attack

896
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,240
or cyberwarfare

897
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,200
is defined as a country's operation

898
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,720
to take down

899
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,080
another country's network

900
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,120
with the purpose to destroy,

901
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,520
or immobilize their computer network,

902
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,600
or make it dysfunctional.

903
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,720
One simple example would be

904
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,480
hacking confidential data

905
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,000
by a hacker.

906
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,240
I guess you all must be wondering

907
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,999
why I'm talking about...

908
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,280
- Damn it! - ...something totally off-topic today.

909
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,080
Well, I'm not.

910
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,280
As love and war

911
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,960
are inseparable.

912
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,040
It's so easy to start,

913
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,880
but so hard to stop.

914
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,600
Oh, love and war,

915
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,280
I wonder when it all began.

916
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,000
It could possibly get started long ago.

917
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,640
That is right, I really thought so.

918
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,440
When one wish to seek for love,

919
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,360
One needs to reserve both mental and physical energy,

920
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,400
As one shall be constantly a battle.

921
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,000
So I wish all of you the best luck.

922
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,199
Is it my fault for me not loving you?

923
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,200
You can't force me to love you back.

924
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,320
I was born a manly man.

925
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,880
Never expected to get wooed by a woman.

926
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,880
A good lady should stay composed and never makes eyes at men.

927
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,640
One will only be precious with gracious manners.

928
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,800
Did Thian write this poem to get back at me?

929
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,600
He's clearly asking for it.

930
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,840
This is gonna be fun.

931
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:41,920
You got it.

932
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,160
Don't make such a fuss with just a little woo.

933
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,760
The more I shall do once you choose to walk away.

934
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,439
I'll do whatever it takes, if it can make you mine.

935
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,480
I suggest don't waste your time trying to stop me.

936
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,840
You can yell at me as you want,

937
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,840
Just please don't shut me out.

938
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,280
Your good look is just irresistible.

939
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,440
That's why I really want you to be mine.

940
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,400
Well, well, I'm on my way to propose to you.

941
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,240
So make sure you are not running away.

942
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,080
Only if you accept the love from me,

943
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,720
I'll soon be returning the files to you.

944
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,880
I love you, Silly Boy.

945
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,480
"Silly Boy."

946
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,399
Can I see your face, Silly Boy?

947
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,600
- Silly Boy. - Had your fun?

948
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,080
The show's over. Get back to work.

949
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,159
- Come on, the fun is over. - Hey, Ton.

950
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,240
Hey.

951
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,640
All of this must stop.

952
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,120
I'm done playing the victim.

953
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,040
What are you going to do?

954
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,879
The hacker girl is hiding in the dark.

955
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,320
But you're out in the open.

956
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,639
She sees everything you do.

957
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,960
I'll lure her out.

958
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,040
We need a plan.

959
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:13,880
"We"?

960
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,480
You mean us?

961
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,960
Of course.

962
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,960
Do you expect me to handle this alone?

963
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,080
- Yes. - Yes.

964
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:21,960
Yes.

965
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,040
That won't do.

966
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,120
You're my friends.

967
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,640
You're partly responsible.

968
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,800
What? That's unfair.

969
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,120
- Right? - Hey, man.

970
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,520
Are you saying you have a plan?

971
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,480
First things first,

972
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,880
we need our secret base.

973
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,800
How about your house?

974
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,040
- No. - Huh?

975
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,879
No one can find out about this, especially Moei.

976
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,200
Don't forget she's one of Hammoc.

977
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,919
We can't trust anyone.

978
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,200
Where should it be if not your house?

979
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,640
Not mine either. Gie won't allow it.

980
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,920
I'm serious. That's a big no.

981
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,280
No, don't look at me like that.

982
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,440
Not mine either. It's totally a bad idea.

983
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,200
I never know when my parents will pay a visit.

984
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,039
One day I wake up, and they were there.

985
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,840
Why did you move?

986
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,079
Guys.

987
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,120
What about…

988
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,840
Since you're all looking at me,

989
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,920
I guess we're using my room.

990
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,560
That's right.

991
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,200
- We're off the hook. - Yes.

992
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,320
These people work for Hammoc.

993
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,600
Oh, man. That's a lot.

994
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,280
How can we find the culprit?

995
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,200
We need to narrow down the suspects.

996
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,880
Beer.

997
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,040
Tell us what you found.

998
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,240
Sure.

999
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,600
The very first one

1000
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,000
is known as Chad or Suchad.

1001
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,199
He's Hammoc's CEO.

1002
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,639
He's a slippery prick who always bails on his staff.

1003
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,800
All he does is flirt with girls.

1004
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,400
Next,

1005
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,239
Korakot or Kob, head of the interior department.

1006
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,879
Comparing to our company, he's ranked as Thian.

1007
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:04,880
Watch it.

1008
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,680
Of course, you're more talented.

1009
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,280
Far beyond his level.

1010
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,560
Next is Mookda, or Kang,

1011
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,440
Hammoc's tomboy hottie.

1012
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,200
She's a talented e-sports player.

1013
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,280
She has won many awards.

1014
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,079
Next is Goong,

1015
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,879
Hammoc's accountant.

1016
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,200
She's great with numbers.

1017
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,560
Need to swap eight and nine.

1018
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,840
She always wins the lottery.

1019
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,519
She's the company's "maknae".

1020
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,200
- "Maknae"? - Don't you know?

1021
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,319
It's Korean.

1022
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,640
Maknae refers to the youngest member.

1023
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,479
Tum is a fan page admin

1024
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,200
of Big Bang, Lee Joon Gi,

1025
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,599
Gong Yoo, and Wanna One.

1026
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,120
She's got Photoshop skills.

1027
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,120
So she's tech-savvy.

1028
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,920
These people are our suspects.

1029
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,040
It's time we strike back.

1030
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,440
Beer, you're in charge of Goong.

1031
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,240
Use your charm to get intel out of her.

1032
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,360
Oh, goodness.

1033
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,520
I'm sorry.

1034
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,520
Watch where you're going.

1035
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:28,640
Here you go.

1036
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,800
I'm really sorry.

1037
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,440
- Here's for you. - Thank you very much.

1038
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,160
Try checking your e-mail.

1039
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,440
- Toon. - Yes.

1040
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,280
- Please give this letter to Mr. Thian. - Thank you.

1041
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,240
- Hey, look. - Whoa.

1042
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,080
What is this?

1043
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,440
It's so pink.

1044
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,520
Hey, Thian.

1045
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,840
Seeing your grumpy face, you must be stressed out.

1046
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,360
Girls are now afraid to get near you.

1047
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,800
You're working too hard.

1048
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,400
Or you fear you won't get your bonus?

1049
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,600
Do you realize how cute you are?

1050
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,960
I really wish you could smile more.

1051
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,800
Wait. Is that a smile?

1052
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,960
I know I'm making you want to smile.

1053
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,720
Wonder why I need to keep reminding you all the time.

1054
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,200
Your eyes are like shining stars.

1055
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,640
They seem like magnificent luring lights.

1056
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,680
I wonder who's the bride you're waiting for.

1057
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,280
As you never spare your eyes for anyone.

1058
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,280
I decide to ask you this question.

1059
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,520
Maybe you'd let me be the one.

1060
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:05,240
I beg you to please show me mercy.

1061
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,120
And open up to me, you're my only one.

1062
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,960
Here I confess, I fall for you.

1063
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:17,040
As long as I can see you, my love will always be true.

1064
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,040
You are my love at first sight.

1065
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,400
Will you please at least look at me?

1066
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,280
Stop pretending

1067
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:30,120
that you're happy being single.

1068
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,080
If you open up your heart and marry me,

1069
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,800
I'll surely take you to heaven.

1070
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,080
Please smile for me, Cutie Boy.

1071
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,600
Oh, wow.

1072
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,120
She really wants to marry you, man.

1073
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,640
Just tell her to propose already.

1074
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,560
Come on. She wrote you such a sweet poem.

1075
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,880
- Smile for her. - Yeah.

1076
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,279
She asked you to smile. So please smile.

1077
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,479
- Smile. - Smile. Come on.

1078
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,800
- Come on, do it. Big smile. - Come on, smile.

1079
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,960
Come on, guys.

1080
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,759
- Yeah, just smile. - Please smile.

1081
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,720
- Give us a smile. - There you go.

1082
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,040
- One more. One more. - That's enough.

1083
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,320
Happy now?

1084
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,880
Get back to work.

1085
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,400
- Go. - Okay.

1086
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,080
- You, too. - I know.

1087
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,400
Moei.

1088
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,920
Don't be so obvious.

1089
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,320
I know you're enjoying this.

1090
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,239
- You know me too well. - Let's go, guys.

1091
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,840
- Wait. - What now?

1092
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,520
Didn't you just tell us to get back to work?

1093
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,520
Who gave you this letter?

1094
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,000
The operator from downstairs.

1095
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,800
- Wait, Thian. Where are you going? - Thian.

1096
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,520
-Where're you going? - Let's follow him.

1097
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,120
- Wait, Thian. - What the heck?

1098
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,560
A messenger came to drop off the letter.

1099
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,280
Do you have his phone number?

1100
01:21:58,600 --> 01:21:59,800
No.

1101
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,640
Will he come again tomorrow?

1102
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,840
I'm not sure.

1103
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,880
I've never seen him before.

1104
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,919
He's not our regular messenger.

1105
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,040
Damn it.

1106
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,440
- This is useless. - What a pity.

1107
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,960
- Yeah. - We'll never know who he is.

1108
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,280
I really don't get it.

1109
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,920
I think the hacker works here.

1110
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,400
Just think about it.

1111
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,960
Besides Yada,

1112
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,119
who else in the company could be your enemies?

1113
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,280
Let me tell you. This won't be easy.

1114
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,360
Could it be

1115
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,120
- one of Hammoc staff? - Right.

1116
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,920
That's highly possible.

1117
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,519
Those people don't like Thian.

1118
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,480
- I agree. - That's enough.

1119
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,480
They might think I can't do anything about it.

1120
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,240
It's time we strike back.

1121
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,640
Seven, seven, seven.

1122
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,680
Seven, seven.

1123
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,520
Let me help you.

1124
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,200
Beer, you're in charge of Goong.

1125
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,360
Use your charm to get intel out of her.

1126
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,760
Copy that.

1127
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,080
Here.

1128
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,959
Oh. Here you are.

1129
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,320
- Thanks. - Oh, hold on.

1130
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,640
Just a second.

1131
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,600
Hello? What is it?

1132
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,560
I told you "two" is coming.

1133
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,840
Upper digits.

1134
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,280
I got golden numbers.

1135
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,840
Nott, you're in charge of Tum.

1136
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,200
It should be a piece of cake for an "Oppa" like you.

1137
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:39,440
Oppa, I love you.

1138
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:45,360
Oh, god. "Shall I take a picture for you?"

1139
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,960
This only means

1140
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,200
I'll be in charge of Kang, right?

1141
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,600
No.

1142
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,720
I see. You want me to keep an eye on Kob.

1143
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,200
You don't need to do anything. Just sit still.

1144
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,280
- Poor you. - Okay.

1145
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,440
I'll handle Kob myself.

1146
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,200
As for Kang,

1147
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,520
I know who can help us.

1148
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,400
Wait. Please wait.

1149
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,400
Hey.

1150
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,760
It's you.

1151
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,640
You're working quite late.

1152
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,600
You need you to find out

1153
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,040
whether Kang

1154
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,880
has something to do with my computer getting hacked or not.

1155
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,840
You have to keep it a secret.

1156
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,520
Shall we get some food?

1157
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,880
Shall we get some food? Let's go.

1158
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,520
I'll pay.

1159
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,600
What are you trying to do?

1160
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,760
You're suddenly trying to befriend with me.

1161
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,680
I remember how you were so rude to me.

1162
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,880
What's going on?

1163
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,080
Hello? The elevator is stuck.

1164
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,880
Kaofang!

1165
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:06,840
What the heck?

1166
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,639
Kaofang, wake up.

1167
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,680
What do I do?

1168
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,960
Oh god, look.

1169
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,320
I can't believe it.

1170
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,080
Just take a picture.

1171
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,880
Hey! Stop that.

1172
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,760
It's true I really want to date you,

1173
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:46,320
but you asked too much from me this time.

1174
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,640
I'm really sorry.

1175
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,960
We're left with one choice now.

1176
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,359
What about Kob?

1177
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,920
Maybe he is the hacker.

1178
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,880
How was it, Den? Got anything?

1179
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,160
Hello?

1180
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:17,840
Hello? Den?

1181
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,640
Why did you ask him to check my computer?

1182
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,640
What's wrong, Thian?

1183
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,040
I'll tell you this for the last time.

1184
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,800
- It wasn't us. - That's not Den.

1185
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,880
- No, he's not. - We are just salarymen.

1186
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,600
We're trying to make a living.

1187
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,160
We wouldn't do anything that stupid and risky.

1188
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,480
I hope you understand.

1189
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,840
We aren't the ones you should doubt.

1190
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,520
If it wasn't Kob, then who was it?

1191
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,560
How would I know?

1192
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,760
Yada is here.

1193
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,800
This is for you.

1194
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,279
Oh, Moei.

1195
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,280
I saw you were dozing off.

1196
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,519
So I brought you this.

1197
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,680
I guarantee its sourness, a real eye-opener.

1198
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:14,760
Oh.

1199
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,840
I'm wide awake now.

1200
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,080
- You are? - Yes.

1201
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,560
I feel alert now.

1202
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,080
- Good. No problem. - Thank you so much.

1203
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,760
It's good.

1204
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,919
By the way,

1205
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:37,040
where are Thian, Nott, and Beer?

1206
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,639
I haven't seen them since lunch.

1207
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,320
They went to…

1208
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,680
No one can find out about this, especially Moei.

1209
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,640
Don't forget she is one of Hammoc.

1210
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,440
We can't trust anyone.

1211
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,639
- So? - Uh...

1212
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,160
They went to see a client.

1213
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,400
Are you sure?

1214
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,000
I don't see any appointment on the schedule.

1215
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,760
It's an urgent meeting.

1216
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:12,160
Are you sure you're not lying to me?

1217
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:16,800
Of course not. Why would I lie to you?

1218
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,800
I think I should go

1219
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,080
and get some water. Okay?

1220
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,720
It's hitting me hard.

1221
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,840
Thian, when are you coming back?

1222
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,960
Your wife is asking about you three's whereabout.

1223
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,960
She won't leave me alone.

1224
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,839
I'm stressed out now.

1225
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,040
Come back quickly.

1226
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,600
Yes. I'm hanging up now.

1227
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,160
- Moei. - Toon.

1228
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,559
I didn't hear you coming.

1229
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,000
I'll get back to work now.

1230
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,119
Never mind. I'll go this way.

1231
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:13,720
Do you mean this way?

1232
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,240
Just tell me

1233
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,800
what Thian is really up to.

1234
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,240
Rest assured

1235
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,800
I'll keep my mouth shut

1236
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,240
that you told me about it.

1237
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:36,440
I see.

1238
01:30:36,441 --> 01:30:42,000
So TecTien is trying to identify the hacker.

1239
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,600
That explains why his friends were approaching us.

1240
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:45,760
Yes.

1241
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,279
Toon also said.

1242
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,280
TecTien is keeping his eye on the suspects.

1243
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,160
We have to be more careful.

1244
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:56,000
Anyway, they are several steps behind us.

1245
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,000
There's no way they can catch up.

1246
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,080
Don't underestimate them.

1247
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,880
Right now, he is the hare who's underestimating us, the tortoise.

1248
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:07,520
We should complete the mission.

1249
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,000
ASAP.

1250
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:44,920
Chet.

1251
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,320
Chet.

1252
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,320
Chet.

1253
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,640
- Want some water? - Yes.

1254
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,080
- Go ahead. - Yes, I need water.

1255
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,080
Chet.

1256
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,120
Hmm?

1257
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,360
What is it?

1258
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,520
It's your hand.

1259
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,320
What about it?

1260
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,720
It's on my butt.

1261
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:19,480
Whoa!

1262
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,919
- Nott, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. - It's fine.

1263
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,040
- I'm not... - Never mind.

1264
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,439
- I'm really not... - It's fine.

1265
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,799
Chet. Please listen.

1266
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,120
It's all right.

1267
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,280
It's fine. It's not a big deal.

1268
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,320
- Nott, wait. - Yes.

1269
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,039
- Okay. - Yes, it's okay.

1270
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,160
About the hacking incident,

1271
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:41,600
have you caught...

1272
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,959
Have you found the hacker?

1273
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,560
Not even close.

1274
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,360
We're clueless right now.

1275
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,520
Yada has an alibi.

1276
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,000
We have no idea who did it.

1277
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:55,640
Thian is very stressed out.

1278
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,599
You're in big trouble now, Thian.

1279
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,760
Wait, Nott.

1280
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,719
Where's Thian?

1281
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,400
- Where's Thian? - He's not here. He's gone to the toilet.

1282
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,639
- Damn it. - Hey.

1283
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,800
Wait, Nott. Hang on.

1284
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,999
What's the rush? You're too fast.

1285
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,440
Tell me what's going on.

1286
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,600
Yada is here.

1287
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,000
Where the heck is he?

1288
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,240
Oh, no.

1289
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,080
Oh my god!

1290
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,440
Thian.

1291
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,160
It was her, right?

1292
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,400
She asked you to do that to me.

1293
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,800
It was a misunderstanding.

1294
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,600
Oh my god!

1295
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,840
Thian.

1296
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,400
Why did you lie that night?

1297
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,080
Thian.

1298
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,760
Let's say we're even.

1299
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,480
You lied to me before.

1300
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,320
Stop.

1301
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,640
I said stop.

1302
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,840
- That's… - Do you know her?

1303
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,400
Tell me.

1304
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,720
Why did you say you missed me?

1305
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,279
Do you know how happy I was

1306
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,720
when you texted me saying you wanted to see me?

1307
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,280
I'm sorry

1308
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,800
for lying to you.

1309
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,200
It was a misunderstanding.

1310
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,760
Are we clear?

1311
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:59,160
No, we're not clear.

1312
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,360
It was her, right?

1313
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,600
She asked you to do that to me.

1314
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,400
Oh.

1315
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,720
- What's going on here? - Kaofang.

1316
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,080
Come with me.

1317
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,920
- Let go of me. - Just come with me.

1318
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,720
- We can talk here. - Let go of my daughter.

1319
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,560
What the hell are you doing here?

1320
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,520
Can you stay out of this?

1321
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,560
We're not at home.

1322
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,360
You can't throw a fit here.

1323
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,560
Are you aware you're ruining my reputation?

1324
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,160
Come on. Come with me.

1325
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,240
- We're leaving. Come. - Dad, let go of me.

1326
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,560
- I said come. Come with me. - I can walk by myself.

1327
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:41,720
Dad.

1328
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,840
What was that?

1329
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:48,760
All right. There's nothing to see here. Get back to work.

1330
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,920
Let's go.

1331
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,200
Hey, Thian.

1332
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,640
That was close.

1333
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,440
Well done, man.

1334
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,120
You nailed it.

1335
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:00,920
- Dad, let go. - Come with me.

1336
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,800
- Dad. - Just shut up and walk.

1337
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,040
Gosh.

1338
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,560
If you don't want your man to kill you,

1339
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,760
you must stop now.

1340
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,880
Dad, let go.

1341
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,039
You don't need to threaten me.

1342
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,040
I'm not scared.

1343
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:14,200
I'm not threatening you.

1344
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,120
Pondej told me whenever you stopped being his wife,

1345
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,520
he would kill you.

1346
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,960
You're so beyond repair.

1347
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,800
You're too obsessed with that guy.

1348
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,000
If you want to live,

1349
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,600
you have to keep being Pondej's woman.

1350
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,240
But if you want to die,

1351
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,000
just go to him, I won't stop you.

1352
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:42,360
Go!

1353
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,080
Tell me.

1354
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,199
Why did you say you missed me?

1355
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,200
I'm sorry

1356
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:07,640
for lying to you.

1357
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:09,960
It was a misunderstanding.

1358
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,920
Hey, Oyua.

1359
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,040
Oyua, my boy.

1360
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:21,680
Have you waited long?

1361
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,120
Get ready. One, two, three, go.

1362
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,960
Snow.

1363
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,920
Snow.

1364
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,760
You're hiding again.

1365
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,440
Come here. Come on.

1366
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,800
Why are you always hiding?

1367
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:40,120
Your bed is here.

1368
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,400
Stay here.

1369
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,280
Stay here. Gosh.

1370
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,880
- Snow. - What is there to eat?

1371
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,400
Why do you look so startled?

1372
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:51,360
It's nothing.

1373
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,639
How could it be nothing?

1374
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,080
I saw it. Don't deny it.

1375
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,520
Did you do something wrong?

1376
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,040
I wouldn't dare.

1377
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,840
I'm so terrified of you scolding me.

1378
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,280
I wish that was true.

1379
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,120
Are you almost done?

1380
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,200
Say, in half an hour.

1381
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,040
- Your delicious food will be ready. - Cook it faster.

1382
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:30,840
- I'm hungry. - Ten minutes then.

1383
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,080
You're unbelievable.

1384
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,320
You sounded like you knew.

1385
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,520
- Can you see them? - I'm still looking.

1386
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,480
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1387
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:16,400
Let's go all out today.

1388
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,920
- What the heck? - You're so loud.

1389
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:23,360
This tastes so bland.

1390
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:25,640
Hey. I see them now.

1391
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,200
Yeah. I see them, too.

1392
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:34,000
- What would you like to drink? - Water, please.

1393
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:35,920
- Hey. - What?

1394
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:39,160
Look where you are. No one orders water here.

1395
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,400
Man up.

1396
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,880
Give us two beers. -Yes.

1397
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,560
- Right away. - Yeah, two beers.

1398
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,240
Hey.

1399
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,920
Your man is looking at us.

1400
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,120
The reason you don't want to stay with me,

1401
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,960
is it because you hiding something?

1402
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:21,520
No one can ever stop what I'm planning to do.

1403
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:22,720
Who's that?

1404
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:24,840
Admin.

1405
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:28,280
Seeing your grumpy face, you must be stressed out.

1406
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,440
Girls are now afraid to get near you.

1407
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,040
Wait.

1408
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,920
This isn't where I left off.

1409
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,400
Whoa!

1410
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:37,440
What's the matter?

1411
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,919
I won't put up with this anymore.

1412
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,880
It's time you stop seeing me as your slave.
