1
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,280
I want the marriage certificate back.

2
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,320
If only you can translate it

3
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,839
within today by 6 pm.

4
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Deal.

5
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:53,360
And tonight, we will groom him

6
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,000
and offer him at your door, Master Moei.

7
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,959
If you agree to cooperate tonight,

8
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,679
you'll get forever love for free

9
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,480
with insurance of sustainability.

10
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,800
And a lifetime guarantee.

11
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,760
Since we got married,

12
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,880
we've never been on honeymoon.

13
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,480
So I could only bring you

14
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
to Myanmar.

15
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,719
If I don't marry her, I have to pay her ten million in alimony.

16
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,440
You can simply get married.

17
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,240
I have to get out of this

18
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
before he uses his body to pay off his debt.

19
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,720
On September 19th and 24th,

20
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,400
TecTien will no longer be a bachelor!

21
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,120
I brought some documents from accounting for you to review.

22
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
Give it to my assistant.

23
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,280
Moei can help you with them.

24
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,120
You call her by her nickname.

25
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,760
- Moei, here you are. - Is it urgent?

26
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,720
I am quite swamped with work today.

27
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,480
If you want it done today,

28
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,200
I don't think I can.

29
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,559
That's all right. I can come again tomorrow.

30
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
Okay.

31
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,999
You work really hard, Moei.

32
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,520
Do you have time for your family at all?

33
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,520
I heard that you're married.

34
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

35
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,880
I am married.

36
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
But,

37
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm getting a divorce soon.

38
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,760
Moei is divorcing her husband

39
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,520
so she can be with TecTien?

40
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,919
Thian, we can discuss this with reasons.

41
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,640
There's no need to get married.

42
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,200
Are you trying to get back at me?

43
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,280
Married?

44
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,280
What does she mean?

45
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,600
Of course.

46
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
Do you think you can get away easily after all the mess you've made?

47
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,120
Do you really think I'll just stand by

48
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,880
and let you get married?

49
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,200
I can't believe this.

50
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,760
What a shameless woman.

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,960
So what? Do you think you can cancel the wedding?

52
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,919
Do you think I'll just let you

53
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,040
have your way and get married?

54
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
Moei.

55
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,760
Work is hard enough.

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,800
Now you're giving me a hard time too?

57
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,560
What should I deal with first,

58
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,320
the work or the woman?

59
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,120
Whatever is convenient for you.

60
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
Luckily, you're my wife.

61
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,640
Soon, I won't be.

62
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Oh, my.

63
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,560
- That's nasty. - Yes.

64
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
- Is it really true? - Of course.

65
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,760
I heard it with my own ears.

66
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,880
- Wait, what's this about? - Right, what is it?

67
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm about to tell you now.

68
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,200
Moei

69
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,160
is planning to catch Tectien.

70
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,679
- What? - Really?

71
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,599
She's even going to divorce her husband to get him.

72
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,640
That only means.

73
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,600
Tectien can't be serious about her.

74
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,400
With that innocent face,

75
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,840
she's a manipulative one.

76
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,120
I thought so too.

77
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,680
We have to find a way to get rid of this immoral woman.

78
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,840
(Law of Marriage Act)

79
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
Coffee?

80
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,880
Not strong enough.

81
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,560
Just get me Red Bull.

82
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,920
(Void Marriage)

83
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,960
Here. Will this do?

84
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,439
- Thanks. - I'll put it here.

85

(Applying for Annulment)

86
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,320
Tum.

87
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,640
- Can you help me with something? - Sure.

88
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,320
What is it?

89
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,320
Can you contact Aunt Jee's lawyer in Phuket for me?

90
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,120
Oh, Tum.

91
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,960
What's the matter?

92
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,760
Aunt Jee's lawyer. You mean Thian's mom?

93
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,040
- Yes. - Hey!

94
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
No way!

95
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,680
Moei, what if I say something wrong

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,560
and it upsets her, and has me killed?

97
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,040
- What will you do? Just think about it. - Oh, gosh.

98
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,279
You know very well how powerful Thian's mom is in Phuket.

99
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,560
You know that, right?

100
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,600
Come on.

101
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,760
She won't do anything to you.

102
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,320
You're my friend.

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,919
- Right. - Please, Tum.

104
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,240
Please help me this time.

105
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,320
- Oh, Moei. - Please.

106
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,360
Won't you help me?

107
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,440
All right.

108
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,560
But why do you want me to contact her lawyer?

109
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,080
Since Thian wants to get married to clear his debt,

110
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
I have to protect myself.

111
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,480
I don't want to be a divorced woman after he's free of debt.

112
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
I need to get this marriage

113
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,240
annulled.

114
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,479
Do you think I'll just

115
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,800
let you have your way and get married?

116
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,960
I am sure that this time,

117
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,360
Moei will finally get to divorce TecTien.

118
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
But don't let anyone know about this plan.

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,240
All right, Kang?

120
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,079
I won't be here.

121
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,719
So you two have to take care of Moei.

122
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
Copy that, Sir.

123
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,440
Please just don't make it like your final words.

124
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,480
Listen.

125
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,080
If our plan succeeds this time,

126
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,239
it will be a great victory

127
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,080
over that egomaniac TecTien.

128
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,240
But

129
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
aren't you scared of Thian at all?

130
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,000
Why would I be?

131
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,760
Bring it on.

132
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,680
- Come on, baby. - I'm looking for Moei.

133
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,440
- Oh, speaking of the devil. - Have you seen her?

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,320
- No. - No.

135
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
Well, last time we played football.

136
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,319
Would you like to play something else this time?

137
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,040
Like skipping rope,

138
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,800
marbles, or frog race?

139
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,920
Where's Moei?

140
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,840
In the...

141
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,440
Well…

142
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,839
if you don't like those,

143
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,600
we have other games, like...

144
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,039
I said, where's Moei?

145
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,400
Moei is at…

146
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,080
Well, the thing is

147
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,920
she said she was sleepy.

148
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,360
So I

149
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,000
let her sleep in my room.

150
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,960
I'll go and get her now.

151
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
I'll get her.

152
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,280
Easy does it, okay?

153
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,320
Hey, Moei.

154
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,600
Moei.

155
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,720
Moei.

156
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,960
- Moei. - Hmm?

157
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,800
Get up, your husband is here.

158
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,400
Moei.

159
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,679
Moei, wake up.

160
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,239
Come on, get up.

161
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,440
If you don't, your man will get worked up.

162
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
Come on.

163
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,720
- Get up. - I know.

164
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,760
Come on, up, up.

165
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,080
When will this be over?

166
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,840
- There they come. - You're surely in trouble.

167
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,400
- We're almost there. - Where is your bag?

168
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,080
Why did you sleep here?

169
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,360
Well,

170
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,920
I was tired, so I took a nap.

171
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,320
- Have you eaten? - Yes.

172
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,960
Let's go home, you can sleep there.

173
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,720
Come on.

174
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,560
Tum.

175
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,160
Get back here.

176
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,280
I know, that's enough. I saw it, too.

177
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,800
Hey.

178
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,680
- Thian, it's fine. - Let me.

179
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,240
Thank you.

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,120
Come on.

181
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,880
Get on.

182
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Thian.

183
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Are you doing my reports for me?

184
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,920
Go to bed. I know you are tired.

185
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
- It's all right, I can... - I said go to bed.

186
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,840
Go on.

187
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,440
Why is he being so nice?

188
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,880
This is so unlike him.

189
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Thanks for writing reports for me.

190
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm going to see Kob off.

191
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,560
See you at the site.

192
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,960
- Kob. - Bye.

193
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,480
Come visit us sometimes, will you?

194
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,960
The Thai office may need you there.

195
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,720
But we're also short-handed here.

196
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,120
Not anymore.

197
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,560
You made the right decision to go back.

198
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,280
I can only hope that

199
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
I made the right decision.

200
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
Moei,

201
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,560
if anyone gives you a hard time again, tell me.

202
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
I'll hurry back to help you.

203
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,760
There comes the van.

204
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,960
Your ride is here.

205
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,840
Have a safe trip. Don't worry about us.

206
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,920
If anyone messes with Moei,

207
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,760
I'll take care of them.

208
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,320
See you in Thailand.

209
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,360
Come on, group hug.

210
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,760
- Come here. - Hey.

211
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Hey, Thian.

212
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,840
It's okay. I'll do it for you.

213
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,040
Goodbye, Moei.

214
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
Okay, bye.

215
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
I'll be off now, Thian.

216
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,120
Stop loitering.

217
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,520
Just go already.

218
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,560
All right.

219
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,480
Do you need help with that?

220
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,760
No. Want to go with him?

221
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,280
I don't know why Thian came.

222
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,280
He totally ruined the vibe.

223
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,720
Don't forget your snacks.

224
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,200
You sure you won't change your mind?

225
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,000
Bye, Moei.

226
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,880
- Bye. - Bye, Kob.

227
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,720
Miss us already, right?

228
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,560
Hey, let's go.

229
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,720
Thian, I need to go to the bathroom.

230
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,239
Why don't you go ahead to work?

231
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,279
Please excuse me.

232
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,520
- Wait, Moei. - Okay, go.

233
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,079
Thian, I'll be off to work, too.

234
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,840
Goodbye, see you.

235
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,759
Let's get down to business.

236
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,239
Last night, I saw with my eyes

237
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,079
that Thian carried Moei to his room.

238
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,000
What, really?

239
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
Show me.

240
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,560
Oh, my goodness.

241
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,120
It's really TecTien.

242
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,800
So those two are really having an affair.

243
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,880
But from I see,

244
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,039
I think these two

245
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,720
already slept together.

246
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,480
That's not all.

247
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,480
(Use Face ID or draw pattern)

248
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,760
Go get it!

249
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm in.

250
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,200
People in the camp are suspecting Moei and Thian are having an affair.

251
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,960
You have to stop the rumors, got it?

252
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,040
Yes, Sir.

253
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,160
I'll watch out for Moei until her divorce is finalized

254
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,960
or until the two reveal their relationship.

255
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,680
Okay? Are you happy, mate?

256
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
Moei is really getting a divorce.

257
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,240
Yes.

258
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,320
We must spread this news.

259
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,400
- Yes. - That's right.

260
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,120
Hey, guys, wait up.

261
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,879
Natheerin and TecTien are having an affair.

262
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,440
What, really?

263
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,880
(Breaking News - Moei is divorcing her husband to hook up with TecTien.)

264
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,000
(Breaking News - Moei is divorcing her husband to hook up with TecTien.)

265
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
Hey.

266
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,680
Moei is getting a divorce?

267
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,880
- Really? - Look.

268
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,040
Let me off here.

269
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,240
- If you need help, just let me know. - Yes.

270
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,080
- Can we use this one? - Come again?

271
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,759
- What are they waiting for? - Oh.

272
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,160
- Won't they go home? - They're waiting to see Moei.

273
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
What?

274
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Why? Haven't they seen her?

275
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,759
They heard that Moei is divorcing her husband.

276
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,840
So they're all here to see her.

277
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,760
That's right.

278
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,120
- Hey, Thian. - Thian.

279
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,200
I'll help.

280
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,880
Where are you going? That way?

281
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,840
- Yes. - Let's go.

282
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,240
Don't you feel weird?

283
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,600
They're watching you.

284
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,920
Sit down.

285
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,160
- Hey, that's my work. - Leave it.

286
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,160
Mom.

287
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,920
What's up, you rascal?

288
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,440
About the wedding.

289
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Can I

290
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,000
move the date?

291
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,680
What?

292
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,120
How long are you going to keep postponing?

293
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,840
It wasn't easy for me to talk Prapha down, you know?

294
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,959
Everything is already settled.

295
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,440
The cards are all printed.

296
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,200
It's not like that, Mom.

297
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,560
I don't want to postpone it.

298
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,760
I want to move it up.

299
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,920
What?

300
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,239
Really? You got it.

301
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,360
But don't forget our agreement.

302
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,440
You can't force Moei.

303
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,120
She has to agree to this herself, understand?

304
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,280
Yes, Mom.

305
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,600
That's wonderful, bye.

306
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,840
Sathit.

307
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,320
Sathit.

308
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,519
- Yes, Madam? - Get the car out.

309
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,320
I'm going to find another wedding date.

310
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,719
An earlier one.

311
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,279
- Okay, Madam. - He wants it sooner.

312
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,480
This way.

313
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,040
Thian...

314
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,720
I'm sure that this time,

315
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,960
Moei will finally get to divorce TecTien.

316
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,720
But don't let anyone know about this plan.

317
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,759
All right, Kang?

318
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,680
Do you think you could plan a divorce without me knowing?

319
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,200
I'll have to marry you

320
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,600
before your plan succeeds.

321
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,240
So it's finally over

322
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,600
between us.

323
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,600
Aren't you going to thank me

324
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,800
for returning your freedom?

325
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,640
I should thank your father instead.

326
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,800
If he wasn't scared of his name being tarnished

327
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,040
because his in-law is in prison,

328
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,320
he wouldn't have forced you to divorce me.

329
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,200
Watch your mouth.

330
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,960
If it wasn't from my help,

331
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,479
your father won't have been bailed out this soon.

332
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,600
Soon?

333
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,920
My father was in jail for months

334
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,799
while you were living comfortably.

335
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,440
Me living comfortably?

336
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,360
I've had to live in hiding.

337
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,160
I couldn't even go back to the country.

338
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,400
Is that what you called living comfortably?

339
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,360
Instead of blaming each other,

340
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,240
why don't we focus on the one who caused all this?

341
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
Thiarawat and Natheerin.

342
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,960
If it weren't for those two

343
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,720
who exposed your father

344
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,960
hacked into TPC,

345
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,280
your father wouldn't be in jail.

346
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,080
You wouldn't have to deal with his company's problems.

347
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,680
Am I wrong?

348
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,080
What are you going to do with them?

349
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,720
What do you think?

350
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,760
Are you interested in working with me?

351
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,000
Since right now,

352
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,040
we have a common enemy.

353
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,920
"If a marriage takes place

354
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,760
without the intention to take the other person as husband or wife

355
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,160
but has a hidden agenda instead,

356
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,840
one in which the spouses do not take care of each other

357
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,040
or live as husband and wife,

358
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,120
either in the natural or factual sense,

359
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,760
that marriage

360
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,720
is deemed to be against Section 1458

361
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,959
of the Civil and Commercial Code."

362
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,720
Tum!

363
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,199
I am safe now.

364
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,639
This is what the lawyer said.

365
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,920
- I am safe now. - Yes.

366
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,439
I'm glad to see you happy and smiling.

367
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,279
I've only seen your grumpy face for days.

368
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,360
Here,

369
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,880
have some snack.

370
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,160
- Tum. - Hmm?

371
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,839
But the lawyer said Thian was planning to use this act

372
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,199
to divorce me, too.

373
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,080
- Okay. - He just hasn't started yet.

374
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,400
I need to get Aunt Jee's permission.

375
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,880
If she says yes,

376
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,519
then I can erase my history

377
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,680
as if I've never been married before.

378
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,880
Right.

379
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,920
And how sure are you

380
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,960
that your situation fits all the conditions?

381
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
- The marriage took place - Right.

382
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,840
because Thian was threatened.

383
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,360
- Aunt Jee is my witness. - Right.

384
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,640
- And all the wedding guests. - Yes.

385
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,480
- But… - See?

386
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,519
You and Thian don't live as husband and wife

387
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
in the factual sense. That's the one.

388
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah.

389
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,680
- That's right. - Yes.

390
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,320
Do you know, if we've never had sex after marriage,

391
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,320
how can they prove it?

392
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,840
How about this? Ask your lawyer.

393
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,079
Yeah.

394
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,120
Call him.

395
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,480
- I'll e-mail him. - He should know.

396
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,320
- Tum. - Hmm?

397
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,640
Why isn't my internet working?

398
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,760
Slow connection? Let me see.

399
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,280
You try it.

400
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,520
Can you connect it?

401
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,520
- It's not working. - What the heck?

402
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,920
What's going on?

403
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,800
- Toon. - Yes?

404
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,600
Has the internet been cut off?

405
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
Really?

406
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,040
Let me check.

407
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,400
It's running normal to me.

408
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,560
What's the matter?

409
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,720
Nothing.

410
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,720
Still no good.

411
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,200
- Toon. - Yes?

412
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,160
Has anyone used my laptop?

413
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,160
Your laptop?

414
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,240
I think I saw Thian do something with it.

415
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,160
Is something wrong?

416
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,520
- No, nothing. - Okay.

417
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,240
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

418
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,360
My laptop can't connect to the Internet.

419
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,760
Has someone blocked my IP address?

420
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,640
Oh, Thian did give me a MAC address to lock just now.

421
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,440
What?

422
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,480
Is it this one?

423
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,120
Yes.

424
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,680
Then could you please unlock it for me?

425
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm afraid I can't do that.

426
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,080
- What? - It's up to Thian.

427
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,440
That's what he asked me to tell you.

428
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,040
Can't you just unlock it?

429
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,200
I'm really sorry.

430
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,640
Thanks a lot.

431
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,360
All right.

432
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,400
I have no phone either.

433
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,280
Now, I'm really completely cut off from the outside world.

434
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,040
I need to talk to the lawyer.

435
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,720
Tum has to help me again.

436
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,920
And for work,

437
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,280
do I need to use pigeons instead of e-mails?

438
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Thanks, man.

439
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Thian.

440
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,880
Hey.

441
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,280
- Thian. - What?

442
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,800
Look, if you're too tired, you can rest, you know.

443
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,760
I'm fine. Don't worry.

444
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,680
If we can get through this evening,

445
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,840
everything will fall into place.

446
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,240
Don't worry about me.

447
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,440
Are you sure?

448
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
Thian.

449
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,960
Thian.

450
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,639
Whoa, Thian!

451
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Thian.

452
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:38,919
Hurry. Get him to the shade.

453
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,600
- Go, go, come on. - This way.

454
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,279
Let me clear the table. Whoa, wait. Let me clear it first.

455
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,240
Okay, Get him down here. Lie him down.

456
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,760
Easy. Anyone has an inhalant?

457
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,200
Come on. You have it?

458
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,720
Okay, thank you.

459
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,880
Hey, don't crowd him. Get some water.

460
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,279
Hey, Thian.

461
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,320
Thian.

462
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,080
My work.

463
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,760
- I have to work. - Stop it right there. You need to rest.

464
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,120
- You'll get worse. Have some rest. - I'm fine, Chet.

465
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,720
- No, you aren't - Thian. Hey, man.

466
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,480
I just followed…

467
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,640
He just fainted.

468
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,080
I followed up with the supplier for you.

469
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,320
What's going on? Why so crowded here?

470
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
- What's all this? - Yeah.

471
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:23,720
Hey, Thian.

472
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,159
Oh, really? Hey, Thian.

473
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,800
Here's the list of materials from the engineers.

474
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,760
Okay. We'll discuss it in the meeting today.

475
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,960
I have to get to work.

476
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,840
- Wait. - Hey, watch your head.

477
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,719
- Be careful, man. - Mind your head.

478
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,280
- You can't just stand up like that. - Move.

479
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,560
- Hey, Thian. - Be careful.

480
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,119
- Thian, watch out. - Chet.

481
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,679
I have to work. Time is running out.

482
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,040
- You should rest. You look terrible. - I'm okay.

483
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,960
- Oh, man. - Your eyes are red.

484
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,240
- Yeah. - Hey.

485
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,920
- Thian. - This is not right.

486
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,639
- Here? - Yes.

487
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,200
Everyone, go back to work.

488
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,800
Back to work now.

489
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,759
- Come on. - You go that way.

490
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,359
Are you all still okay?

491
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,839
Of course, we're freaking tired.

492
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,240
- But not as tired as him. - Right.

493
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,799
As the supervisor, everything goes to him.

494
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,240
Even with Moei's help, it's still too much.

495
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,760
You're right.

496
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,520
He has to plan, supervise,

497
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,799
and keep things within the budget.

498
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Right. He has to prepare documents for the contracts, too.

499
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
He's loaded.

500
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,680
Hey, Thian. I forgot to tell you.

501
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,959
Tomorrow the consulting engineer will come to see your structure.

502
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,840
Right, use it for the roof.

503
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,239
- What? - No.

504
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,119
- You can't. - They're consulting engineers.

505
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,199
They aren't the roof tiles. They're checking the structure, are you okay?

506
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,680
I don't think he's okay.

507
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,440
- Let's put him away. - Okay, let's.

508
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,800
Help me carry him.

509
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,920
- One, two, three. - Let's go.

510
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
- Who's free? Over. - You guys, look there.

511
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,200
Have someone replace Thian for an hour.

512
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
He needs to rest and recharge.

513
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,760
- Whoa. - Come on.

514
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,999
I think it's not straight.

515
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,959
- Just rest first. - I think we need to fix it.

516
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,160
- Come on, move. - Go lie down for a bit.

517
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,800
- What about you? - Don't worry, just go.

518
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,520
Go.

519
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,160
Don't worry about work, Thian.

520
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,760
- Right, we'll talk later. - Get some sleep.

521
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,160
Why didn't you let him sit in the car?

522
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,679
Why put him in the back?

523
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,240
- Hey, Thian! - Thian!

524
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,520
- Thian. - Sit down.

525
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,040
Oh, man.

526
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,240
- Does he think he's Hercules? - He's losing it.

527
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,520
One water, please.

528
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,240
Do you also have any painkillers?

529
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,320
Lozenges, inhalants, balms, everything.

530
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,680
- This is bad, Tum. - Come on. it's not a big deal.

531
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,440
Guys, Moei is coming.

532
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,480
Ri.

533
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,400
- Moei, Tum, hello. - Hello.

534
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,880
I'll go get some water.

535
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,720
- Ri. - Hmm?

536
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,520
Thian is giving me a hard time again.

537
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,039
Hey, Tum, over here.

538
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,680
- Tum, wait. - What?

539
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,720
The guy talking to Moei,

540
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,080
who is he?

541
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,080
Oh, that's Ri.

542
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,519
He's her brother.

543
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,760
Ri?

544
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,200
Is he the guy supervising Phase Two at the port?

545
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,519
Yes, right. I remember him now.

546
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,040
He's the head civil engineer.

547
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,920
I see.

548
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,200
That's why

549
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,160
they look similar.

550
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,360
Do they have any other siblings?

551
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,080
Hey, wait.

552
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,440
Isn't he TecTien's brother?

553
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,040
Oh, my.

554
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,840
I'm in trouble.

555
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,080
So the three of them are siblings?

556
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,120
Maybe.

557
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,160
- My dear Tum. - What?

558
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,880
- If I wanted to win Moei's heart... - Right.

559
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,360
Do I butter up Ri

560
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,200
or Thian?

561
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,920
- Hey. - What?

562
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,320
I think Thian's a hard nut.

563
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,280
He looks like he's constantly wearing a mask.

564
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,600
Ri seems a lot friendlier.

565
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,280
I suggest you go through him.

566
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,080
What a stupid idea.

567
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,280
What's the use going through Ri?

568
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,360
- He's at Phase Two. - Right.

569
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,720
He could sail out to sea anytime.

570
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
Moei is with Thian,

571
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,920
so I have to go through Thian.

572
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,040
Hey, but he's a real fierce one.

573
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,760
If you want the tiger cub,

574
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,720
you have to enter the tiger's cave.

575
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,880
What makes you think he will just give you his sister?

576
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,360
Right, Tum?

577
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,120
Gosh!

578
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,920
It's hot.

579
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,760
TecTien.

580
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,440
You go ahead. I'll go talk to him.

581
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,560
Okay.

582
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,480
- Where are you going? - Tum.

583
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,719
- You come here. - Let's go.

584
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,040
- Hey. - What?

585
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,199
She is going to town and will be back in the evening.

586
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,240
What?

587
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,919
Who's she going with?

588
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,640
- It's her business. - Excuse me.

589
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,720
Excuse me.

590
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Well…

591
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,400
Are you Ri and Thian,

592
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,320
Moei's brothers?

593
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,160
Well, yes.

594
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,920
- His neck is just stiff. - The thing is...

595
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,760
Could you please give this to Moei?

596
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,640
I heard that she's single.

597
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,840
So I'd like to…

598
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,480
- To what? - Whoa.

599
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,319
Please calm down.

600
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,039
I'd just like to introduce myself.

601
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,200
Please spare your time to listen first.

602
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,000
My name is Suwit and I'm a great guy.

603
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,840
I'm really hard-working.

604
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,000
My family is quite well off.

605
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,360
Our businesses include machine shop, mines, petrol stations,

606
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,759
flea markets, and housing estates.

607
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,720
Most importantly, I graduated from America.

608
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,159
I graduated from Mars, and I'm not bragging.

609
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,240
I want to meet aliens.

610
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,840
Can you take me to Mars?

611
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,360
That was just a joke.

612
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
Well…

613
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,280
Please give this to Moei.

614
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Hey, the mission is completed.

615
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,120
Let's go.

616
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,080
That's entertaining.

617
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,200
Wait, Thian.

618
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,400
When was the Mars campus built?

619
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,360
Just now.

620
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,200
You are unbelievable.

621
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,320
So annoying.

622
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,600
- Wait. - Yes?

623
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,000
A guy from zone A gave you this.

624
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,520
He's nice, hard-working, and well off.

625
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,600
What's his name?

626
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,560
It's on the card.

627
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,280
Suwit?

628
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
I guess.

629
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,680
This is cute. Thank you.

630
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,400
Hey.

631
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,800
What are you doing?

632
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,120
Hey, what's that for?

633
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,240
Hey.

634
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,360
Moei.

635
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,040
Hey.

636
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,640
What are you doing?

637
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,440
Taking out the battery.

638
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,120
What?

639
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,960
Moei.

640
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
Let's go.

641
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,880
Just a second, Tum.

642
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,200
You have to unlock my laptop.

643
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,480
Why would I?

644
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,999
Then how am I supposed to work?

645
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,800
I can't send any e-mails.

646
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,520
Save them when you're done.

647
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,000
Tell me where to send. I'll send them for you.

648
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,200
Then what do you need me for?

649
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,760
Since I can't help you do anything.

650
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,080
Listen when I speak.

651
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,480
Don't make me scold you. Understand?

652
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,080
So you won't unlock my laptop?

653
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,480
No.

654
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,520
Thian.

655
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,960
Thian.

656
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,920
Hey!

657
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,800
Hey!

658
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,120
Moei!

659
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,160
- Let's go. - Get back here!

660
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,240
- Come on. - Wait for me.

661
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,360
Moei!

662
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,000
Moei!

663
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,760
You troublemaker.

664
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,240
Moei.

665
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,640
That was harsh.

666
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,400
He's going to kill you.

667
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,080
No.

668
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,400
He's not that mean.

669
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,920
Gosh.

670
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,400
But you shouldn't have done that.

671
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,999
I know I shouldn't.

672
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,760
But if it can get my laptop unblocked,

673
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,000
it had to be done.

674
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,640
Look at me.

675
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,080
I feel like I have no limbs.

676
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,120
If I don't do anything,

677
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,880
I'll have to stay like this until the wedding.

678
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,520
Yeah.

679
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,080
You're right.

680
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,160
Come on, the van is here.

681
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
Moei, wait for me.

682
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,680
Moei has been contacting Madam's lawyer

683
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,400
about the law

684
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,679
and how the marriage between you two

685
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,040
can be annulled.

686
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,239
I never expected you

687
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,920
to try the same strategy I initially planned.

688
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,440
I've been living like a hermit,

689
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,520
I never touched you even once.

690
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,040
But don't forget our agreement.

691
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,199
You can't force her.

692
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,720
She has to agree to this herself, understand?

693
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,400
But if you won't stop trying to cancel the wedding,

694
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,520
I'll have to find a way

695
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,440
to prevent our marriage from ending

696
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,120
before the wedding day.

697
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,800
My dear Payom flower,

698
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,440
I have always cherished you.

699
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,680
It is now time to pick you

700
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,240
as I can't wait for you to bloom.

701
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,680
As I fear that when the right time comes,

702
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,960
you may fall from your branch

703
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,240
and forget all the promises you made

704
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,760
that you'd love me until your last day.

705
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,320
Thian.

706
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
What is it?

707
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,640
My guy said he saw Pondej's men hanging around here.

708
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,960
What?

709
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,160
Where's Moei?

710
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,920
She's in town with her friend.

711
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,000
Why? I don't get it.

712
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,680
I've seen how you felt for him from the beginning.

713
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,879
And you've waited so long for the day

714
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,760
you'll get to be by his side as his wife for real.

715
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,679
So why now...

716
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,600
Do you think you can really get over him and leave?

717
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,960
Tum, well...

718
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,840
I don't want to be his body-shield anymore.

719
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,679
Gosh.

720
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,040
So you want to give up now?

721
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,880
Can't you hang in there? You've come so far.

722
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,720
Just keep going.

723
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,560
Tum.

724
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,440
No matter how far I have come,

725
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,760
but if there's nothing waiting for me at the end,

726
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,960
I don't know why I should keep going.

727
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,800
Come on. You can't give up.

728
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,240
If you want something waiting for you,

729
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,320
it's not hard at all, Moei.

730
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,120
I can help you.

731
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,400
- Tum. - Hmm?

732
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,040
When I give you a signal,

733
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,000
run and call Thian, okay?

734
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,960
- What about you? - Don't mind me.

735
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,320
Ready?

736
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,320
No, I'm not. I'm not okay.

737
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,040
How can I leave you? You crazy?

738
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,960
- Go, Tum. Now. - Whoa.

739
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,440
Hey, let her go.

740
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,880
Let her go.

741
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,160
- Let go. - Tum, go.

742
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,640
Moei, oh, Moei.

743
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,800
You hit me really hard last time.

744
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,080
If you hadn't hurt my loved one first,

745
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,560
it wouldn't have ended that way.

746
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,640
Then you and I

747
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,040
have something to clear up.

748
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,600
Get your men to find Moei now.

749
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,000
Arthit, what are you doing?

750
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,000
- Tum? - Hello? Thian?

751
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,879
Get Moei back to the camp now.

752
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,480
It's too late. Pondej already took her.

753
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,520
What?

754
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,760
Damn it!

755
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,040
So let's do it that way.

756
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,840
Hey.

757
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,520
It's your doing, isn't it?

758
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,240
I can't believe

759
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,880
you're working with Pondej.

760
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,960
You know very well what he's capable of.

761
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,000
- Let go. - Where's Moei?

762
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,160
- Let go. - I'm asking where you and Pondej took Moei.

763
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
I don't know anything.

764
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,639
If you and your wife did something to invoke him,

765
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,000
then I can't help you.

766
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,400
If you want to take revenge,

767
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,640
take it out on me.

768
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,000
Leave her out of it.

769
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,400
That I can't help.

770
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,000
One has to pay for what one did.

771
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,080
Leave me out of this.

772
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,960
- Found her? - No.

773
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,640
Come on.

774
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,800
Okay.

775
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,640
What did Arthit say?

776
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,800
Have they found Moei?

777
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,400
She's nowhere to be found.

778
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,800
Thian.

779
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,560
- Hey, Thian. - Thian.

780
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,520
Moei!

781
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,480
- Moei. - Moei.

782
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,320
- Moei. - Thian.

783
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:43,800
- Moei. - Thian, wait.

784
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,920
Don't.

785
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,680
Did Pondej do anything to you?

786
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,280
Are you hurt?

787
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,080
Thian, I'm fine.

788
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,120
Then you and I

789
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,640
have something to clear up.

790
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,440
Oh, dear. Are you scared?

791
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,120
Look.

792
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,920
Do you really think I'd do something to you?

793
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,600
A gentleman like me

794
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,960
would never hurt a woman.

795
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,240
Where's Thian?

796
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,520
Isn't he with you?

797
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,760
He probably wanted to scare us.

798
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,440
Come on.

799
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,120
At least, you are not harmed.

800
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,160
Moei!

801
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,920
- Moei. - Tum.

802
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,240
Oh, you're back.

803
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,600
I thought you wouldn't make it.

804
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,360
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

805
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,440
It's all right, Tum.

806
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,880
Look.

807
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,360
I'm back safe and sound.

808
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,360
Right.

809
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,160
- Ri. - Yes?

810
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,480
You said Yada came here. Is that true?

811
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,480
Don't worry about that.

812
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,320
I'll take care of Yada and Pondej.

813
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,520
Your job

814
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,599
is to listen to me.

815
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,000
And never leave the camp without my permission.

816
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,920
- Yada came here? - Yada came here?

817
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,200
Yes.

818
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,919
I think she wants to revenge for putting her dad in jail.

819
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,880
She must be working with Pondej.

820
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,640
I'll find out what Yada is doing here.

821
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,640
But I don't think she's here to represent TPC.

822
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,600
I'll help Chet.

823
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,200
I have some connections with other companies.

824
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,400
I could ask them.

825
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,320
Great.

826
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,280
- Thanks. - Sure.

827
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,480
Has the lawyer e-mailed you back?

828
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,440
No one has returned my mail.

829
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,639
If he does, you have to tell me right away, okay?

830
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,680
Okay.

831
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,640
I will.

832
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,440
But are you sure Thian won't break your neck?

833
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,240
If this thing with Pondej hadn't happened,

834
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,640
Thian would have dealt with you already.

835
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,880
Guys,

836
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,080
there's something else I need your help with.

837
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,320
It's a big mission that I have to proceed tonight.

838
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,800
And I have to succeed.

839
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,160
What is it?

840
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,320
Who else?

841
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,240
Wait. Hey, Moei.

842
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,080
- What? - I think…

843
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,000
- I have a feeling something is about to happen. - What is it?

844
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,360
- Mingalaba. - Mingalaba.

845
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,919
Welcome. Come with us. It will be fun.

846
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,479
- Come on. - Let's have a seat.

847
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,960
Make yourself at home.

848
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,720
- I'll sit with new friends. - Come on.

849
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,280
Oh, Moei.

850
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,960
See? My hunch was right.

851
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,399
Tom, no, Tum. I almost forgot my friend's name.

852
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,319
- There's no breeze. - Come on, sit.

853
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,160
Just sit down. Why are you standing?

854
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,680
What do we do, Tum?

855
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,920
- We join them. - Come on, sit.

856
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,519
- Come sit. - Sit down.

857
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,560
Come on.

858
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,280
Yes. Come sit.

859
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,240
- Right. - Yeah.

860
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,239
Hey, Nott. Cheers, man.

861
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,800
Sure, man.

862
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,400
She's your wife.

863
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,680
You're drunk, man.

864
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,080
Will you come again?

865
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,400
Beer, you know.

866
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,679
- That's it? What are you saying? - What the heck?

867
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,520
Why is your glass empty?

868
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,000
Come on, don't let it be.

869
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,440
No, don't let her.

870
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,199
Come on. Have some more.

871
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,479
No, you can't sit here.

872
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,040
- Well… - Why?

873
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,200
Well, our place is rented off today.

874
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,119
Only VIP customers can sit.

875
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,399
- I'm the owner, so I can sit. - Yes.

876
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,800
Why are you standing? You got hemorrhoids?

877
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,240
- Go sit down. - Go.

878
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,040
- Go sit. - Go on.

879
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,920
- Right here. - Yes, go.

880
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,240
Come on.

881
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,000
Pour me more beer.

882
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,480
There's still some left.

883
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,399
Shall we sing?

884
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,639
- What about a show? - Pick the song.

885
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,680
- I'm leaving now. - Hey, wait.

886
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,080
- I'm in a hurry. - Why so rush?

887
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,200
Accompany me here.

888
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,840
Thian.

889
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,400
Here.

890
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,520
I'm not drinking.

891
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,640
If I get drunk, you'll get in trouble.

892
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,360
Don't be scared.

893
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,360
I'll drink with you.

894
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,360
Hey.

895
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,920
Listen up, everyone.

896
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,399
Let's cheers.

897
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,680
- Come on. - Sure.

898
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,880
Come on.

899
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,960
I really don't want to drink.

900
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,439
I can't sing anymore.

901
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,879
Why? Are you drunk?

902
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,999
Yes, very pissed.

903
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,360
Thian.

904
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,239
Okay, let's get the check.

905
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,120
- Okay. - You pay.

906
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,520
- Thian. - It's good they let us stay here.

907
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,640
I'm hot now.

908
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,600
I think I'm drunk.

909
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,320
Who's drunk?

910
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,200
I'm not drunk.

911
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,520
Oh, Thian is drunk.

912
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,880
No, no more. That's enough.

913
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,400
Where are you going?

914
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,680
Come on, Moei.

915
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,080
- Have some. - I really don't want to drink.

916
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,760
Come on.

917
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,720
Come on, Moei. Just a sip.

918
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,400
- Here. - Okay, come on.

919
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,399
- I'll drink too. - You got it.

920
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,760
- You're really drunk. - Bottom up.

921
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,720
I told you I'm not drunk.

922
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,000
Here.

923
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,920
Oh.

924
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,480
Want some more?

925
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,560
- No, I don't... - Come on.

926
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,320
Just one more.

927
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,160
The fish is so crispy.

928
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,360
Come on, one more.

929
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,400
- This one is for Moei. - Cheers!

930
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,240
Tum.

931
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,840
Yes?

932
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,320
These are documents.

933
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,000
I knew you wanted it, so I printed it out.

934
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,160
You wanted these, right?

935
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,720
But I think

936
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,600
you won't need it now.

937
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,760
Is there really no other way?

938
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,760
You may be legally married.

939
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,359
But if you've never had…

940
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,240
You know, I mean

941
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,160
physical relationship,

942
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,800
the court will accept the case.

943
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,400
You know, being husband and wife,

944
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,920
those things are natural.

945
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,080
What if it happened but one person insists it didn't?

946
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,640
Well, if you don't want

947
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,880
to go through physical examinations,

948
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,760
you need to have evidence.

949
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,759
Do I need to show a video to the court?

950
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,920
Not like that, Mr. Thian.

951
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,080
You just need a witness who knows what's going on.

952
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,959
All right.

953
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,479
About the paper that Moei's friend asked for,

954
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,600
you can send them over.

955
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,640
- I'll give it to her. - All right.

956
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,960
Now I have my witness.

957
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,080
Oh, my.

958
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,880
Moei.

959
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,760
I guess your fate is in Thian's hands now.

960
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,160
And I

961
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,080
have become his main witness.

962
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,880
Why me?

963
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,360
I cut down two months to tonight.

964
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:34,039
No wedding, but there'll be bedding ceremony.

965
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,840
You have to pay for your evil plan.

966
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,440
I wanted to wait but you made me to this, what a shame.

967
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,160
I want Moei drunk

968
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,720
so what happened that night can happen again.

969
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,240
The night when she got drunk and tried to make a move on me.

970
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,960
I really wonder

971
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,080
which law will I have to break

972
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,520
if I force my husband to sleep with me.

973
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,720
Moei.

974
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,680
What are you doing?

975
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,240
I'm going to rape you.

976
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,760
Hey, what are you doing?

977
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,600
Thian.

978
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,080
Thian.

979
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,880
How about we

980
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,760
have a few rounds of fun?

981
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,400
I've experienced it myself,

982
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,000
how horny she could get

983
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,160
when she's drunk.

984
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,120
But that night will be different from tonight.

985
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,520
Tonight, I'll do everything she wants.

986
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,040
I'll take off every piece if she says so.

987
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,400
I'm sorry, Moei.

988
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,240
I wanted to wait until our wedding day,

989
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,680
but I have to do this now out of necessity.

990
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,720
So after tonight,

991
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,080
our marriage

992
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,600
won't be void anymore.

993
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:01,800
Oh.

994
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,480
Moei.

995
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,320
Moei.

996
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,720
Moei, don't doze off on me.

997
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,920
What the heck?

998
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,600
Why isn't she active like last time?

999
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,520
Okay.

1000
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,000
- Moei. - Hmm?

1001
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,600
Come on.

1002
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,120
Come on.

1003
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,520
How I take this off?

1004
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,640
- Whoa! - You die!

1005
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,040
Wait, Moei.

1006
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,120
Moei.

1007
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,560
Whoever wants to hurt Thian,

1008
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,920
beware.

1009
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,800
You'd better watch out!

1010
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,440
Don't sleep yet, good girl.

1011
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,280
Let's finish this first.

1012
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,200
Moei.

1013
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,040
Moei.

1014
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,920
Wake up and finish our things.

1015
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,680
What has not finished?

1016
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,080
A report?

1017
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,200
No, not a report.

1018
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,080
Homework.

1019
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,080
What homework?

1020
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,800
Well…

1021
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,120
The one we have to do together.

1022
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,880
Oh, stupid boy.

1023
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,240
Don't you know how to do it yourself?

1024
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,279
I'm not stupid.

1025
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,480
It's something we need to do together after marriage.

1026
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,040
All right.

1027
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,280
Do you have to take your shirt off?

1028
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,520
Well,

1029
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,280
it's easier this way.

1030
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,760
Then I'll help you.

1031
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,080
Do I have to take mine off too?

1032
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,240
I'll help you.

1033
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,320
But I think

1034
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,160
if we take a shower first,

1035
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,960
it will be easier?

1036
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,960
I'll go take a shower.

1037
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,400
Hey, Moei.

1038
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,160
Hey.

1039
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,440
Are you okay?

1040
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,200
- Moei. - Hmm?

1041
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,800
Have some water.

1042
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,360
Better now?

1043
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,600
Moei.

1044
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,320
- Where am I? - It's this room.

1045
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,720
Here.

1046
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,200
See you.

1047
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,560
It's been half an hour.

1048
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,840
Is she okay?

1049
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,880
Moei.

1050
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,240
Are you done?

1051
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,760
What took you so long?

1052
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,920
Can you walk?

1053
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,280
Come on, let's go there.

1054
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,960
Where?

1055
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,640
Follow me.

1056
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,160
Isn't the crescent moon beautiful?

1057
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,120
Yeah.

1058
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,600
Beautiful.

1059
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,680
Oh.

1060
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,200
Why do you play so hard to get?

1061
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,160
Want a Bachelor Trophy or something?

1062
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,480
Hard to get? You already got me.

1063
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,440
- Why still nagging? - Hmm?

1064
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,800
Can I have your number?

1065
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,120
Your phone number,

1066
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,240
not your shoe size.

1067
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,200
Are you done talking?

1068
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,920
No.

1069
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,840
Do you know

1070
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,920
that you're super cute?

1071
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,040
And

1072
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,080
your butts

1073
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,440
are really sexy.

1074
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,960
I always peek at them

1075
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,840
while you're studying the blueprints.

1076
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,160
Stop it.

1077
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,400
Handsome.

1078
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:51,880
So handsome.

1079
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,280
Very handsome.

1080
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,200
Seriously,

1081
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,480
can you stop sweet-talk me?

1082
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,520
Just do what you want to do.

1083
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,680
Jump my bones already.

1084
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,560
If you keep talking until morning,

1085
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,160
Mite and Louse won't ever come.

1086
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,680
No.

1087
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,320
They say if I force myself on my husband,

1088
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,360
it is also illegal.

1089
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,080
- I'll go now. - Hey, wait. Moei.

1090
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,920
But…

1091
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,840
What if your husband consents?

1092
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,200
Also no.

1093
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,680
I have to treat you gently.

1094
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,920
I can't bruise you or anything.

1095
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,160
It's Aunt Jee's order.

1096
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,640
Aunt Jee?

1097
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,120
Do you know

1098
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,280
that you

1099
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,480
have a really nice smile?

1100
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,320
I don't know why you don't like to smile.

1101
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,480
If you love it,

1102
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,400
why don't you love me?

1103
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,480
I can't.

1104
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,600
I can't love you too much.

1105
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,320
I may never be able to get over you.

1106
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,040
Why must you get over me?

1107
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,840
I want you

1108
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,800
to find someone better than me.

1109
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,760
Gosh, I really don't get you.

1110
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,800
Don't get mad.

1111
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,440
The truth is,

1112
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,480
I don't deserve you at all.

1113
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,120
I can't compare to you.

1114
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,360
I'm just a vendor's daughter,

1115
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,400
while you're the son of a hotel owner.

1116
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,920
Just getting to marry you

1117
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:50,720
already made me so happy.

1118
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,920
My love for you

1119
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,280
is not about possession.

1120
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,240
I want your bride

1121
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,840
to be someone who deserves you more than me.

1122
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,800
I don't want to be selfish

1123
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,760
and use Aunt Jee's love for me

1124
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,520
to force you to marry me.

1125
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:51,360
I never wanted you to question my love for you.

1126
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,240
When we love someone,

1127
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,640
everything we have

1128
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,120
always seems to be less precious than our love.

1129
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,960
What do you mean?

1130
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,640
I mean

1131
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,360
my life.

1132
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,320
I would give up my life to you

1133
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,000
if you wanted it.

1134
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,640
Moei.

1135
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,720
No, Thian.

1136
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,160
I still have something to tell you.

1137
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,200
And I have to do it now.

1138
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,440
Because if I was more sober,

1139
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,480
I wouldn't have the courage to do it.

1140
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,560
I…

1141
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,480
really have nothing to my name.

1142
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,880
The most precious thing in life

1143
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,200
that has been given to me

1144
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,680
is you.

1145
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,960
I don't know how much her love for me is,

1146
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,120
and where it ends,

1147
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,680
but this is more than enough

1148
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,800
for me to choose not to let this woman go.

1149
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,520
Are you done talking?

1150
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:14,160
When the wind of love blows by,

1151
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:18,480
I can feel the sweet warmth all around,

1152
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,960
It is so sweet and glamouring,

1153
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,200
that I must surrender to you, my love.

1154
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,240
It is such a strange wonder.

1155
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,480
What makes you loved me for so long.

1156
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,640
No matter how cruel to you I have been,

1157
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,360
You have never strayed from me.

1158
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,880
I guess I may have to keep exploring.

1159
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,800
What the true color your love is.

1160
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,480
Will it be true and committed until the last day?

1161
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,240
Or do you just want to conquer me?

1162
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,880
Now that you have won my heart,

1163
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,360
how much longer will you love me?

1164
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,360
Or will you leave me to mourn

1165
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,080
the eternal loss of you?

1166
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,320
Moei.

1167
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,960
Can you promise me

1168
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,080
if I become yours tonight,

1169
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,760
you won't leave me again,

1170
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,280
and you'll love only me?

1171
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,200
- Wait, Thian. - Moei,

1172
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,680
I think you've talked too much tonight.

1173
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,200
Now,

1174
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,240
let me.

1175
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,560
Thian.

1176
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,160
I…

1177
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,040
I think

1178
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,840
we shouldn't do this yet.

1179
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:29,760
You love me, right?

1180
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,840
Hey,

1181
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,120
we're married.

1182
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,400
I'm your husband.

1183
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,760
Have you forgotten?

1184
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,280
Moei,

1185
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,320
if you're going to wake up and get mad at me tomorrow,

1186
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,840
please know

1187
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,880
that I'm doing this

1188
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,120
because I love you.

1189
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,200
May the earth witness

1190
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,320
the pleasure of us two

1191
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,600
taking part in the rituals of marriage

1192
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,600
to keep us bound together evermore.

1193
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:04,000
The cool breeze blows by.

1194
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,840
As the moon descends to my side,

1195
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,080
It makes the whole sky goes dark

1196
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,480
except for this light in my arms.

1197
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,440
I love you as I never thought I would.

1198
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,600
How surprisingly fate has brought us together.

1199
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,640
Most men always desired you,

1200
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,720
but I foolishly overlooked you.

1201
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:40,200
You love me, now it's time for me to love you.

1202
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,320
There's no longer an escape for you.

1203
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:49,200
You have tormented me so,

1204
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,520
yet why are you scared of my kisses?

1205
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,400
Nature designed men and women to physically relate.

1206
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,200
I'm not trying to tease you

1207
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,160
because this is normal for lovers.

1208
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:09,120
Now let me teach you the ways.

1209
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,440
The Payom tree has grown tall in this house,

1210
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,920
so it supposedly belongs to me.

1211
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:22,000
Though I never touched you before,

1212
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,400
it does not mean others now can.

1213
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,120
It's because of you trying to leave me,

1214
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,000
I had to think of a secret plan.

1215
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,120
To get the winds of love to blow you back.

1216
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:43,120
So we would finally be as one.

1217
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,640
Mingalaba, everyone.

1218
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,720
How's business today?

1219
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:15,999
How's it going?

1220
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,720
It must be good, I know.

1221
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,399
See how you put on the powder.

1222
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,679
Don't you think it's too much?

1223
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,040
Get younger vegetables next time.

1224
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,400
Let's wake them up.

1225
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,319
Hey, baby.

1226
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,200
What are you doing here?

1227
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,720
Want me to help you relax?

1228
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,920
What the heck?

1229
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,720
- Mingalaba. - Mingalaba.

1230
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,120
Are you awake?

1231
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,560
Of course I am.

1232
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,800
Shall we wake your friends up, too?

1233
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,720
Why are you sitting here? Let me see.

1234
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,160
Rise and shine.

1235
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,240
What the heck? Where did you come from?

1236
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,760
I'm just waking you up.

1237
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,440
Why got so close?

1238
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,840
No, don't.

1239
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,960
What are they?

1240
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,440
Just give us something hot for the hangover.

1241
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,360
- All right. Just a sec. - Right.

1242
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,840
So why did Thian ask us

1243
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,200
to intoxicate everyone last night?

1244
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:51,840
Could it be...

1245
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,760
Thian and Moei…

1246
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,360
Bang, bang, bang!

1247
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,720
- Bang, bang, bang. - Hey!

1248
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,480
What the heck?

1249
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
What was that? You freaked us out.

1250
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,160
Really?

1251
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,880
Oh, Moei, my friend.

1252
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,920
Gosh.

1253
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,840
Oh.

1254
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,080
Gosh!

1255
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,240
Oh, Moei.

1256
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,600
Tum, why the small tree?

1257
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,520
Bang your head on the big one.

1258
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,800
Kang.

1259
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,440
It's Moei.

1260
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:35,640
Moei?

1261
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:38,440
- What's with Moei? - Well, she…

1262
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,520
- She what? - Gosh.

1263
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,280
What's with Moei?

1264
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,600
What's with Moei? Just tell me.

1265
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,160
Nothing.

1266
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,520
Huh?

1267
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,360
What the heck?

1268
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,360
Why is Thian so quiet?

1269
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,720
- I hope they're not fighting. - No.

1270
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:09,399
But

1271
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,960
are you sure you heard him right?

1272
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,080
He said it himself he wanted to marry Moei.

1273
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,800
The date is already fixed.

1274
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,640
The bride and groom just have to come back for the ceremony.

1275
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,520
- Hold it right there, Sathit. - Yes, Madam.

1276
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,640
What can I do for you, Madam?

1277
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,720
Did Thian say anything to you behind my back?

1278
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,840
Don't tell Mom about Pondej.

1279
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,400
Once I get it handled, I'll tell her myself.

1280
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,040
Yes, sir.

1281
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,919
No, Madam.

1282
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,759
He didn't say anything at all.

1283
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,800
Are you sure?

1284
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,600
Yes, Madam. We didn't talk.

1285
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:51,840
All right then.

1286
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,200
May I go now?

1287
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,640
Can you promise me

1288
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,440
if I become yours tonight,

1289
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,480
you won't leave me again,

1290
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:29,880
and you'll love only me?

1291
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,960
If you're going to wake up and get mad at me tomorrow,

1292
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,200
please know

1293
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,360
that I'm doing this

1294
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,600
because I love you.

1295
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,280
Love?

1296
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,760
Does he really love me?

1297
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,720
Moei.

1298
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,520
- Ri. - Have you waited long?

1299
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,080
No.

1300
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,320
Why do you look tired? Aren't you feeling well?

1301
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,920
No,

1302
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,640
I'm fine.

1303
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:34,960
You wanted to see me.

1304
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,240
What's going on?

1305
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:39,720
Well...

1306
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,920
When I met Pondej yesterday,

1307
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,080
he had a message for Thian.

1308
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,360
What does he want?

1309
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,600
Where's Thian?

1310
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,320
Isn't he here with you?

1311
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,120
I have something to talk to him about.

1312
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,920
Next time when you're free,

1313
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,760
how about you ask him to come to town with you?

1314
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:08,520
How about this?

1315
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,480
Can you make appointment with him for me?

1316
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,520
He wants to meet with Thian.

1317
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,200
What do you think?

1318
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,840
I think we've been running long enough.

1319
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,720
If we don't deal with this once and for all,

1320
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,200
we'll just have to keep running.

1321
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,520
Do you agree with me?

1322
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,120
You're right.

1323
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,960
We shouldn't run from anyone.

1324
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,800
These are Thada Constructions' plans.

1325
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,240
We haven't been able to follow them.

1326
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,560
That's why there's a delay.

1327
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,360
I see.

1328
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,200
I'll talk to the project manager,

1329
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,839
- and I'll get back to you. - Yes.

1330
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,840
Right.

1331
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:16,920
Hello?

1332
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,400
Come see me after work.

1333
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:21,640
Where?

1334
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,240
I'll send a car.

1335
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,480
Let's go back to our room.

1336
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:58,239
- Hey, no, Kang. - You stop it right there.

1337
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,599
You have no right to this to Moei.

1338
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,160
- You. - Do you remember me now?

1339
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,960
I hear you wanted to see my brother.

1340
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,080
I'll take you to him.

1341
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,200
Listen.

1342
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,160
Pondej wants to have you and Natheerin killed.

1343
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,800
Moei!
