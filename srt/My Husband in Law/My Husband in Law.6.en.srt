1
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,360
The reason you don't want to stay with me,

2
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,200
is because you hiding something?

3
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,800
No one can ever stop what I'm planning to do.

4
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,880
Who's that?

5
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,080
Admin?

6
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Seeing your grumpy face, you must be stressed out.

7
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,840
Girls are now afraid to get near you.

8
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,880
This isn't where I left off.

9
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,240
- Whoa! - Thian.

10
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,160
I won't put up with this anymore.

11
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
It's time you stop seeing me as your slave.

12
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
So?

13
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,240
The hacker girl.

14
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,720
My opponent is suffering a setback.

15
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Should I step up my game now?

16
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,960
It's all fine with me.

17
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,080
Just tell me when and where.

18
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,240
The menu is freaking long.

19
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,040
Just order something light.

20
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Oh, hey. Moei is here.

21
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,400
Come on. Sit right here.

22
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,040
- Welcome. - Hi.

23
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,559
Look here. What would you like to have?

24
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,119
How about something light? Maybe a cocktail?

25
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,840
- Whoa! - What the heck?

26
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,640
- What's with him? - He just bumped into me, what a brat.

27
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,200
Thian.

28
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,440
Can I go home?

29
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,760
I slept only two hours last night.

30
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
No.

31
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,640
You can't leave early on a Friday night.

32
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,160
- A whole night fun. - For sure.

33
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
So what will you have?

34
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,320
Not too strong, okay?

35
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,600
Order some food. I'm hungry.

36
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,360
Tonight, you're my pawn to checkmate

37
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,680
those who are trying to bring me down.

38
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,760
Aren't you going to dance with your friends?

39
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,560
Why?

40
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,280
Are you trying to get rid of me?

41
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,920
It's not that.

42
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
Do I make you

43
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,160
uncomfortable?

44
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
No.

45
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,400
Should I believe you?

46
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,800
Just lean on me.

47
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,160
It's hard to believe

48
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,160
that we're actually married.

49
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,120
Let me ask you something.

50
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,800
Did you say yes

51
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,120
because you have feelings for me?

52
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,880
No.

53
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,000
Where did you get such idea?

54
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,040
It's so obvious

55
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,280
yet the defendant won't admit it.

56
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,320
Never mind.

57
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,200
It's not the time to get you cornered.

58
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,400
What about now?

59
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,280
Are you seeing anyone?

60
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,520
No, I'm not.

61
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
Hey, guys. Look there.

62
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,080
Over there.

63
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,480
What is he up to again?

64
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,440
Yes, Moei looks so flustered.

65
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,280
Tiger Thian is showing his prowess.

66
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
I used to think

67
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,040
nothing could ever happen between us.

68
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,200
Now that I think about it,

69
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,800
how about we

70
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,440
try dating for real?

71
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,960
- What? - Hey.

72
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,640
You heard me.

73
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
So what do you say?

74
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Thian.

75
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,520
I need to go to the restroom.

76
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,600
Don't be long.

77
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,920
Are you here?

78
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
I've just arrived. It's packed here.

79
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,320
Where should we meet?

80
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
What are you doing here?

81
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
Are you with Thian?

82
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Yes.

83
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,120
It's good I see you here.

84
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,480
I know what you told my father.

85
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,520
You must love Thian so much

86
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,360
since you dared ask my father to rid me from him.

87
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,320
You may have made a deal with my father.

88
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,280
But it's just between you and my father only.

89
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,040
Do you really think

90
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,480
that by doing this,

91
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,520
Thian will love you?

92
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Don't you know he only married you

93
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,960
because he was being harassed by my ex-husband?

94
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,320
If not for you,

95
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,120
Thian and I would be together by now.

96
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
Don't you forget that.

97
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
I told you, I don't care about the past.

98
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,920
Right now,

99
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,880
Thian is mine.

100
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,760
We're married. We live in the same house.

101
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,480
We may not be in love,

102
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,160
but an opportunity like this,

103
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,080
what man can resist?

104
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,280
You are shameless!

105
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,520
You came after me, and you plan to steal him?

106
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,840
What a thief!

107
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,040
I don't care what you say.

108
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,040
I love Thian.

109
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,680
I've loved him for a long time.

110
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,920
Many more years than you have.

111
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,920
Probably since before you even knew he existed.

112
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,200
So I'll never let you take him away.

113
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,240
You'd better back down.

114
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,200
Look, he is sitting over there.

115
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,200
Go say goodbye.

116
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,640
Where's Thian?

117
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
Hello.

118
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,360
Thian,

119
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,200
how long have you been here?

120
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,600
Come back to our table.

121
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,560
I wonder how much he heard.

122
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,120
He is…

123
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,240
Thian, you asked me out here.

124
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,160
Why did you bring that woman?

125
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,840
Come sit next to me.

126
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,640
Whoa, I'm out of here.

127
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,600
Listen to me well.

128
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,000
Moei and I,

129
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,120
we're in love.

130
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,280
I fall deeper for her each day.

131
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,920
So nothing will ever tear us apart.

132
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,520
Get over me.

133
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,600
Go back to where you belong.

134
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,920
And stop trying

135
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
to come between us.

136
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,160
Get out of our lives.

137
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
No.

138
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
I don't believe you.

139
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,880
Tell her that it's true.

140
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,640
It's true.

141
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
Mr. Pondej asked me to bring you home.

142
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,400
How do you know I am here?

143
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,320
It's all fine with me.

144
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,080
Just tell me when and where.

145
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,280
I brought my car. I'll go home by myself.

146
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,760
I suggest you come with me

147
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,919
if you don't want to be in bigger trouble.

148
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
This is a friendly warning.

149
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,600
Please.

150
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,920
Thian.

151
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,400
Yes?

152
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
What is it?

153
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,080
At the restroom,

154
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,600
how much did you hear?

155
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
You mean when you said I was yours?

156
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,760
Also,

157
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,880
what you said

158
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,720
at the pub,

159
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,760
what did that mean?

160
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,680
I said a lot of things. I can't remember it all.

161
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,040
What did I say?

162
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,960
You

163
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,600
asked me

164
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,480
to take this relationship seriously.

165
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,000
And

166
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,960
you told Yada...

167
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,640
That we're in love.

168
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,200
And that nothing could tear us apart.

169
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
And then.

170
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,480
I looked at you like this.

171
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,000
Do you really think that I was serious?

172
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,160
What makes you think I would love a girl like you?

173
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,280
No way.

174
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,360
I only said that to get Yada to leave.

175
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,400
And you have been

176
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,000
a great buffer.

177
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,680
Thanks for helping me drive Yada away.

178
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,640
I think this time

179
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,280
she will leave for good.

180
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,600
I hope you understand

181
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,000
that I'll never love you.

182
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,880
Of course.

183
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,880
I've always known

184
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,840
that you will never love me.

185
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,440
I'll go to my room now.

186
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,440
Do you really think I was serious?

187
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,600
What makes you think I would love a girl like you?

188
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,320
How about we

189
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,560
try dating for real?

190
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,720
Moei and I,

191
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,800
we're in love.

192
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,480
You have to accept the truth

193
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,680
that you can't force someone

194
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,680
who doesn't have feelings for you to love you.

195
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,480
Do you really think I was serious?

196
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,200
What makes you think I would love a girl like you?

197
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,760
Get out of our lives.

198
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,040
I don't believe you.

199
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,720
Tell her that it's true.

200
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,600
It's true.

201
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,919
I've loved him for a long time.

202
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,320
Many more years than you have.

203
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,080
Probably since before you even knew he existed.

204
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,680
So I'll never let you take him away.

205
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,840
Thian.

206
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Why can't you love Moei?

207
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,240
I know you're not that stupid.

208
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,680
You can see how she feels about you.

209
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,280
- Can't you give her a chance? - Mom.

210
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,040
Moei is not the woman I love

211
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,600
and she's not the one I want to marry.

212
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't you understand?

213
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,200
Let me tell you.

214
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,120
You have been a great buffer.

215
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,640
Thanks for helping me drive Yada away.

216
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,840
I was wondering why you behaved so well lately.

217
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,440
It turns out you're hatching a plan to leave me.

218
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,120
Right?

219
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,840
You bitch!

220
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,320
You planned to use these videos

221
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,920
to sue me for divorce.

222
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm sorry, but I caught on to you.

223
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,320
Where do you think you are going, bitch?

224
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,240
You're here. Don't you know each other?

225
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,760
My lawyer.

226
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,640
Don't feel bad.

227
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,360
You were right to side with me.

228
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,600
This woman can only give you money.

229
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,160
But I can give you so much more.

230
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,320
No.

231
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,160
- Come here! - No!

232
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,640
Did you think you were about to succeed?

233
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,520
Is that why you dared defy me

234
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,680
and went to see that loser?

235
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,520
You're so pathetic.

236
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,560
I bet he chased you away again.

237
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,920
I think it's finally the time

238
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,360
for me to teach you a real lesson

239
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,640
so that you won't go against me again.

240
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,160
No! Don't!

241
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,000
Why are you doing this to me?

242
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,440
Why do you have to hurt me?

243
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,720
Why do you have to hurt me?

244
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,040
Why?

245
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,160
Tell me why?

246
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,000
Why do you have to keep hurting my feeling?

247
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,880
Have you never thought that I loved you?

248
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,240
I hate you! Let go of me!

249
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,320
Why does it have to be like this?

250
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,640
- Come here! - Hey!

251
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,120
What are you doing?

252
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,920
- Come here! - Hey!

253
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,360
What are you doing?

254
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,040
What are you doing in my room?

255
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,440
- Happy Birthday! - Happy Birthday!

256
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,159
Mom, Ri, what's all this?

257
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,959
Celebrating your birthday of course.

258
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,680
- My birthday? - Yes.

259
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,760
- It's today? - Yes.

260
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,880
- It's today. - Hay, man.

261
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,440
So you overworked that you forgot your own birthday?

262
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,840
Unbelievable.

263
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,400
- The both of you. - What?

264
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,360
I offered you to manage the hotel, but you said no.

265
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,840
You wanted to be someone else's employees.

266
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,600
Look at you.

267
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,800
- How come I got scolded too? - Can you let her go now?

268
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,320
Happy birthday, Thian.

269
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,639
I like this. It's so fun.

270
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,440
Happy birthday.

271
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,640
Hello, Aunt Pha.

272
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,200
Hello, Thian.

273
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,040
Happy birthday.

274
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,520
Thank you.

275
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,200
Thian.

276
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Yes?

277
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,120
I heard that

278
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,400
you're sending Moei to work in Myanmar.

279
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,360
I'm really glad

280
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,880
that you help Moei with all these opportunities.

281
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Uh, I...

282
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,560
Anyway,

283
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,360
I really thank you.

284
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,120
However,

285
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,840
has she ever done anything to make you uncomfortable?

286
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,800
No.

287
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,080
She has never done anything like that.

288
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,480
I don't know if you're telling the truth.

289
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,279
If she has ever done

290
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,640
anything to make you feel bad,

291
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,040
I must apologize on her behalf.

292
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,680
Please don't do this.

293
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,240
The thing is...

294
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,160
Moei is always like a little girl.

295
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,320
She doesn't think well before she acts.

296
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,760
I give you permission to discipline her.

297
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,360
I raised her on my own,

298
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,640
I might haven't taught her many things.

299
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,400
So she might do something wrong

300
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,360
without even realizing it.

301
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,120
But whenever she realizes it,

302
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,960
she always feels remorseful.

303
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,680
I have only one child.

304
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,600
I want her to have a good future.

305
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,000
Mom!

306
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,840
Where are you?

307
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,680
Mom.

308
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
I miss you so much.

309
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,680
I miss you so much too.

310
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,560
Can I not let you leave? Can I just lock you here?

311
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,560
Mom, what were you saying to Thian?

312
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,600
I was apologizing him on behalf of my little troublemaker.

313
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,480
Come on, Mom.

314
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,719
I've never been a troublemaker, you know?

315
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,080
You still haven't grown up.

316
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,360
Oh, wow. Everything looks delicious.

317
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,240
- Hello, Aunt Pha. - Hello, dear.

318
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,920
- Mon. - Yes?

319
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Can I please borrow your car?

320
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,360
Of course. Here you go.

321
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,320
- That's so kind of you, thank you. - No problem.

322
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,440
I'm going out to run some errands.

323
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,480
Aunt Pha, where's the birthday boy?

324
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,640
He walked over that way.

325
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,880
- Please excuse me then. - Sure.

326
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,960
- Mon. - Happy birthday.

327
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,240
Thank you.

328
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,960
Hey, that's your car.

329
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,560
Someone is going somewhere?

330
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,560
- Moei is going out for some errands. - I see.

331
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,480
What?

332
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,720
Is she…

333
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,960
Hey. Where are you going, Thian?

334
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
- Why is it locked? - What's going on?

335
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
- Sorry. - What the heck?

336
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,360
The hacker risked going ahead knowing we might be watching.

337
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,240
He must be under pressure, too.

338
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,319
You have to be careful, don't let the hacker get any opportunity.

339
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,800
We don't know what other information he wants.

340
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,240
- Sorry! - Thian!

341
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,159
Thian. Where are you going?

342
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,960
- Ri, move! - Thian, wait.

343
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,440
- What's going on? - Ri!

344
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,960
It's your birthday, you can't go.

345
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,240
- Ri, cover up for me. - Hey, Thian!

346
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,120
- Thian! - Thian!

347
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,080
This time, I'll catch you red-handed.

348
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,359
Do you really think I'll let you leave easily?

349
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,440
Really?

350
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,080
You've been with this grumpy face for an hour.

351
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,840
Right. Aren't you glad to see your family?

352
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,480
Is it that bad to celebrate with us?

353
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,440
Maybe Thian is really busy.

354
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,800
Besides, we dropped in without warning.

355
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
It's not that.

356
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,200
Then what is it?

357
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,280
I just…

358
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,200
I saw Moei...

359
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,600
- went out alone. - Yes.

360
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,440
So what? Look.

361
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,360
Why are you so worried about her?

362
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,320
I'm not, I just fear that she might…

363
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,440
What?

364
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,560
- Why don't you just say it? How annoying. - That's right.

365
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,400
- What are you so scared of? - I fear that she…

366
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,520
You all tried to stop me from going out because...

367
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,079
Yes, I went out to pick up the cake

368
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,000
at the new bakery down the road.

369
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,560
I'm here to pick up the cake.

370
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,160
Thank you.

371
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,920
Close your eyes, make a wish, and blow out the candles.

372
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
Come on.

373
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,480
I have a present for you.

374
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,600
Give me your hand.

375
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,360
Happy birthday, Thian.

376
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,000
May all your days be filled with happiness.

377
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,200
Hey!

378
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,560
Wait and see. I'm going to catch you

379
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,760
right in the act.

380
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,599
- Want some pomegranate juice? - It's good.

381
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,800
I'll dig in now.

382
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,559
Mom. This is for you.

383
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,920
Thanks, dear.

384
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,760
I don't want cake now. I don't want to get fat.

385
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,040
- Can I have something else? - No, you won't get fat.

386
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,560
- Thanks, bro. - Thank you, Thian.

387
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,639
I ordered this cake from the new bakery.

388
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,879
I had them make it look like Thian.

389
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,080
- Doesn't it resemble him? - It really does.

390
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,880
Yeah, it looks like him.

391
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,079
You know how? Look at the eyebrows.

392
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,959
- Looks like his grumpy face. - Mom's right.

393
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,720
Can you make an angry face?

394
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,240
- Do it. - Yeah, do it.

395
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,440
- So we can see if it looks like you. - Yeah.

396
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,840
- There he goes. - Right.

397
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,760
It looks just like him.

398
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,760
- The face is also alike. - Had your fun?

399
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,520
Okay, I'll stop.

400
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,720
Yeah, exactly.

401
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,400
I'll take one of these.

402
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,920
I think he's mad at me now.

403
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,160
- Just keep on eating, I'll be right back. - All right.

404
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,720
Mom.

405
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,320
Why are you sending Moei to Myanmar?

406
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,600
Not only she told her mom about it,

407
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,840
she also told on me to my mother?

408
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,240
She didn't tell on you.

409
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,999
She thought she might be in Myanmar for a long time,

410
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,919
so she called to say goodbye.

411
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,240
And I happened to be with Prapha when she called.

412
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,640
So that's why you flew all the way here to see me.

413
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,720
I thought so. You've never thrown me a birthday party before.

414
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,040
Hey.

415
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,040
Don't change the topic.

416
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,600
Just answer my question.

417
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,360
It's work.

418
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,880
Can you not send her?

419
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,320
Send someone else instead.

420
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,040
If you don't want her to go,

421
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,200
then she has to quit.

422
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,360
Thian, let me ask you something.

423
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,200
Don't you have any bit of feeling for her?

424
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,120
No.

425
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,160
Fine.

426
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,760
But you know I love her so much, right?

427
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,280
You said that a million times already.

428
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,000
Then get yourself sorted.

429
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,159
I'll give you three months

430
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,440
then you can get divorced.

431
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,560
What?

432
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,880
Really?

433
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,880
You'll let me divorce Moei?

434
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,120
I'm serious.

435
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,960
But you have to pay her ten million in alimony.

436
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,040
Ten million?

437
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,480
Isn't that too much?

438
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,960
It's far less than what she has sacrificed for you.

439
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,520
What if I don't pay?

440
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,840
Then you can't get divorced.

441
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,079
I'm going to hold another wedding for you and Moei.

442
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080
I'll make it huge.

443
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,000
Everyone in the province will know about it.

444
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,160
Mom, ten million is too much. Are you kidding me?

445
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,880
Where can I get that much money?

446
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,320
It still cracks me up.

447
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,960
You are amazing.

448
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,920
You really got him this time.

449
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,360
Don't laugh at your brother.

450
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,840
You're also guilty, don't you know?

451
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,919
Don't think of going anywhere, stay.

452
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,000
If I hadn't asked you, you wouldn't have spilled it

453
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,040
that Thian used all his money to buy TPC shares.

454
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,800
But you managed to find his weak spot.

455
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,480
You shouldn't be mad at me.

456
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,800
You are so full of excuses.

457
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,240
- These two brothers are so alike, mother. - Yes.

458
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,400
They never spill any beans.

459
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,960
If not in trouble, there's no way they would crack.

460
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,080
That's right.

461
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,600
Mom, look at her.

462
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Come on, honey, don't rub it in.

463
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,720
Don't say that to your wife.

464
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,359
I should have sent you and your brother to work in Phuket.

465
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Yeah.

466
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,240
Oh, Mom, I'm sure.

467
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,639
Thian will have to accept your terms.

468
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,199
He must be stressed out right now.

469
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,039
There's no way he can get that money.

470
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,600
- So he doesn't have money for Moei? - No.

471
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,000
That's good.

472
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,720
It's Thian.

473
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,160
It's Thian.

474
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,360
Can't you lend me the money?

475
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,280
- It's just ten million. - Ten million?

476
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,600
Are you crazy? Ten million is not like a hundred.

477
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,600
You know that I don't have cash.

478
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,320
I used all my savings to buy stocks.

479
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,560
Damn it!

480
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,240
By the way, why do you need ten million?

481
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,479
It's Mom.

482
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,199
She said I have to pay ten million if I want to divorce.

483
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,119
And she overheard it.

484
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,320
Moei heard it?

485
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,880
So what did she say?

486
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,000
What do you think? She wants ten million.

487
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,680
She wants ten million?

488
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,360
Hey, aren't you alone?

489
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,400
Thian, the thing is,

490
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,720
I didn't betray you, but Mom outsmarted me.

491
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,760
Now she knows you invested all your money in shares.

492
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
Sorry.

493
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
Wait, someone wants to talk to you.

494
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,280
Hello?

495
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,080
What's up, my boy? Are you sweating yet?

496
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,839
Just because you're my son doesn't mean you can buy anything.

497
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,840
You can't even afford your freedom.

498
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,120
I guess Moei is a quick learner.

499
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,400
Let me talk to him, too.

500
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,200
Just face it, Thian,

501
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,600
you can't escape your destiny.

502
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,440
- Thian? - Oh, he hung up.

503
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,960
- It got him hard. - He must be sulking now.

504
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,279
- Ri. - Oh, hey.

505
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,479
- Oh, he's here. - Jeez, you're all here?

506
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,040
Open the door.

507
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,799
Come on in, young man.

508
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,879
- Ri, you! - Hey, calm down.

509
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,639
- Let's talk. - You are in this together.

510
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,160
- Calm down. - I said get off of me.

511
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,720
- Gosh! - What the heck?

512
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,000
What's so funny about this?

513
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,160
Of course it funny seeing you so upset by all of this.

514
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
You all are unbelievable!

515
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,880
- What? - Darn it.

516
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,360
You deserve it.

517
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,999
TPC holds billions of authorized share capital.

518
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,160
It also attracts a lot of international investors.

519
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,320
Once we get hold of the company,

520
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,720
we sell all the shares.

521
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,600
How much money will come in our pocket?

522
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,040
It's lots of figures, right?

523
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,360
It does sound interesting, Father.

524
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,240
Well, I don't know.

525
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,120
I think I want something more.

526
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,560
I want Thiarawat dead.

527
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,920
He's the one that made Yada wanted to divorce me.

528
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,480
It's now the time

529
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,880
your daughter and that prick

530
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,480
pay for what they've done to me.

531
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,480
Yada just made a mistake.

532
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,680
She didn't mean it.

533
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,840
You think I'll do that to Yada?

534
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,800
Come on, Father.

535
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,960
I'm not that evil.

536
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,160
Look.

537
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,560
I would never do anything to my wife

538
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,920
unless…

539
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,720
she doesn't stop trying to divorce me.

540
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,920
In that case. I can't promise.

541
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,560
Pondej owns your life and mine.

542
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,200
Don't antagonize him.

543
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,280
You should stop interfering with that couple.

544
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,600
It's for your own safety.

545
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,640
Sir.

546
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,240
- Sir. - What is it?

547
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,280
I'd like to update you on the current situation.

548
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,600
All of our informants at TPC are transferred to Myanmar.

549
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,080
What does the advisory team suggest me do?

550
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,000
Withdraw our shares from TPC.

551
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,480
It's to minimize our risks.

552
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,440
Ultimately, Natheerin and Thiarawat are married.

553
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,360
We never know when she'll turn against us.

554
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,640
We should first withdraw all our shares at TPC.

555
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,480
Once we have all the information we need,

556
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,880
we should end the deal with Natheerin.

557
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,120
Mr. Thada's pulled out all his shares?

558
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,800
Yes.

559
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,600
Actually, I have also learned

560
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,559
that all executive officers

561
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,240
are not happy with the way he does business.

562
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,520
They slowly lost their trust in him.

563
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,360
Thanks to you since you agreed to follow Mr. Baramee's plan.

564
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,240
Mr. Thada finally pulled out the shares on his own.

565
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,800
So my plan at the pub that night

566
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,840
even affected the big boss.

567
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,280
- Hey, Den. - Yes?

568
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,920
How did it go with Hammoc's computer IPs?

569
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,960
I didn't find anything out of the ordinary.

570
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,960
I think they did a good job covering their tracks.

571
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,640
This guy is real good.

572
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,280
It will be hard to catch him.

573
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,080
Hey. What the heck?

574
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,760
Nothing is responding.

575
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,520
What the heck?

576
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,960
Nothing is responding.

577
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,080
You too?

578
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,880
We are being hacked!

579
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,240
Damn it!

580
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,720
How could this happen?

581
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,680
Den.

582
00:48:49,681 --> 00:48:51,879
- Yes? - Ask other departments if they got hacked.

583
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,040
Okay.

584
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,880
Hello?

585
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
What? The whole office is being hacked!

586
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,159
How could it happen all at once?

587
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,880
The server room.

588
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,800
Hey, wait.

589
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,360
- You stay here, I'll go. - All right.

590
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,240
What's going on, Den?

591
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,000
Give me three days.

592
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,040
I'll get you the cost estimates for all their project bids.

593
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,840
Three days is too long.

594
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,600
I'll give you only today.

595
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,800
And I don't want just the estimates.

596
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,559
I want the plan for one big project

597
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,600
that Thiarawat is working on, too.

598
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,000
And that is the skyscraper project,

599
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,760
one of the new landmarks in Hong Kong.

600
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,920
Thian is on his way to the server room.

601
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,200
Damn it!

602
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,040
What is it?

603
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,040
The computers are back online?

604
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,560
Hey, stop!

605
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,000
Yes, Mr. Thiarawat?

606
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,520
Can I help you?

607
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,560
- Did you see anyone pass this way? - No.

608
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,760
- Thanks. - No problem.

609
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,840
I just sent you the estimates for all project bids.

610
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,480
But I couldn't find the plan

611
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,280
for the skyscraper you mentioned.

612
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,600
Somebody came in first.

613
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,240
Just give me two days,

614
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,280
and I will send you the plans.

615
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,640
Please relay the message to Mr. Thada.

616
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,720
Thank you.

617
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,920
Wow, Thian.

618
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,520
You must be so hungry that you cooked your own meal.

619
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,160
I'm sorry for coming home late.

620
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,680
You got anything to tell me?

621
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,040
Nope.

622
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,760
I'm giving you a chance.

623
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
After this, the deal is off.

624
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,840
I don't have anything to tell you.

625
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,720
I hate liars.

626
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,960
I know.

627
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,720
I'll ask you one last time.

628
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,120
Do you have anything to tell me?

629
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,320
I promise.

630
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,160
I won't get mad.

631
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,600
You can say it.

632
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,720
There's a fly on your egg.

633
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,280
I mean your fried egg.

634
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,360
I gave you that chance.

635
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,560
- Looks yummy, Mom. - Yes.

636
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,080
Mom.

637
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,040
Are you really leaving today?

638
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,280
Can't you stay another night?

639
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,360
Listen.

640
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,000
If you miss me, find time to come and visit me.

641
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,040
Oh, Thian's here.

642
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,159
Go set the table.

643
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,160
Okay.

644
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,120
- Here you are. - Thank you.

645
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,240
The rice is coming shortly.

646
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,160
Deadline?

647
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,160
From what I remember, she submitted all her work.

648
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,800
Here's your rice.

649
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,520
What deadline do you have?

650
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,040
Oh, it's for Hammoc.

651
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,799
Come on, Thian.

652
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,240
Just dig in.

653
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,720
Or you'll be late.

654
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,759
Marry me today,

655
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,079
and get forever devoted love for free

656
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,959
with a lifetime guarantee.

657
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,480
From the Housewife.

658
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,480
- Oh, sorry. - It's all right, Mr. Thian.

659
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,520
Write three more reports.

660
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,240
- What? - Finish them within today.

661
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,200
But Thian, three reports in one day?

662
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,440
That's impossible.

663
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,800
Maybe tomorrow?

664
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,200
Why?

665
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,320
Do you have something else after work?

666
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,320
- No. - If that's the case,

667
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,600
finish them today.

668
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,360
Fine.

669
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,800
- All done. - What?

670
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,120
Are you sure they aren't sloppily done?

671
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,200
I poured my heart and soul into them.

672
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,920
So my work is done for the day, right?

673
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,480
No.

674
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,960
- You have a meeting to attend. - What?

675
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,560
- But it's off-hour already. - No buts.

676
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,600
It's an order. Got it?

677
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,959
Greetings.

678
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,000
I'm going to explain our project's timeline.

679
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,920
In phase one, we are building a highway

680
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,839
from Kanchanaburi to Dawei,

681
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,279
which is 160 kilometers long.

682
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,280
Phase two is a deep-water port,

683
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,520
which is located 34 kilometers north of Dawei.

684
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,760
Phase three is an industrial complex

685
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,279
with an area of 320,000,000 Square meters

686
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,120
which will be divided into A-E zones.

687
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,640
Zone A will be for heavy industry and ports,

688
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,840
as well as oil and natural gas industries.

689
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,280
- Ri. - What are you doing?

690
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,400
I'm going to say hi to Ri and Mon.

691
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,960
Don't.

692
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,680
They're here to represent an allied company

693
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,800
which will be investing in our project.

694
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,080
They're working.

695
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,280
Okay.

696
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,840
Why aren't they sitting together?

697
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,520
Ri is a civil engineer,

698
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,440
while Mon is a consulting engineer.

699
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,200
Mon's job is to oversee Ri's work

700
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,880
to prevent corruption.

701
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,280
That's why they pretend not to know each other.

702
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,880
Our oceans are facing a crisis.

703
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,520
The marine ecosystems are endangered.

704
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,880
Wait. Thian.

705
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,360
- Thian - Sorry.

706
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,040
- Thian, wait. - Hey, where are you going?

707
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,439
Why are you in such a hurry?

708
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,080
- Out of my way. - Wait, Thian.

709
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,160
- Thian. - What's going on?

710
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,200
Yes, Chet.

711
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,520
A client is coming in?

712
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,720
Right now?

713
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,440
There he comes.

714
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,040
- Let's go. - Okay.

715
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,680
- Sathit. - Yes? Mr. Thian.

716
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,880
- What is it? - Don't leave to Phuket with Mom yet.

717
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,520
I need your hand with something.

718
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,960
What is it?

719
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,840
Wait for Moei at the company.

720
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,280
Whenever you see her leave,

721
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,760
follow her.

722
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,080
All right, Mr. Thian.

723
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,920
- Thian. - Hey, Thian.

724
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,640
- Are you going after Moei? - Yes.

725
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,840
Hey, wait.

726
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,879
But Chet told you the client is coming in.

727
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,400
You have to do the presentation.

728
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,640
- Okay. Nott, Toon. - Yes?

729
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,440
- You do it for me. - What?

730
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,479
- Hey. - If you two have to do it,

731
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,400
then I'm free. What a jackpot.

732
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,959
Hey, Thian, wait for me!

733
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,160
Oh, Beer.

734
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,080
(Stand by.)

735
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,840
Stand by.

736
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,640
Den, the hacker is in place.

737
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,199
Whenever he begins, notify Sathit.

738
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,400
He's my guy.

739
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,200
Sathit.

740
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,720
The hacker has started.

741
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,920
All right.

742
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,600
Uh, Ms. Moei.

743
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,000
Mr. Thian wants you to come with me right now.

744
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,480
Thian is having me followed.

745
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,440
To make sure

746
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,280
the car tailing us is really Thian's guy,

747
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,039
we have to do this.

748
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,199
Tum and I will have to swap clothes.

749
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,480
Kob, look at the road. Don't look behind you.

750
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,920
Kang. Is Kob peeking?

751
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,320
No, I'm not.

752
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,880
Once we're there,

753
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,520
Kang will get out of the car.

754
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,320
And then,

755
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,160
Kob will let Tum out.

756
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,320
When Sathit follows her…

757
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,280
- Excuse me, Uncle. - Oh, Uncle?

758
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,760
I think you are mistaken.

759
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,080
Right, I am wrong.

760
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,480
- Sorry. - It's okay.

761
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,120
I'll leave now. This is embarrassing.

762
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,720
Bye.

763
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,320
Why does she look so different?

764
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,640
Did I just get fooled?

765
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,920
Kob and I

766
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,920
will go straight to the working location.

767
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,760
- Is everything okay? - Yes.

768
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,400
This mission will take quite some time

769
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,120
due to the size of the file.

770
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,320
We'll be racing against the clock.

771
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,360
Taxi. Thian, this one.

772
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,760
Taxi.

773
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,800
Taxi!

774
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,040
- Over here, Mr. Thian! - Sathit.

775
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,240
- Mr. Thian. - How is it?

776
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,680
- I still can't find Moei. - What?

777
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,280
- She disappeared. - Where is she?

778
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,119
Thian, try thinking where she likes to go.

779
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,879
How I know? I never cared about her.

780
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,320
Jeez, you really don't care about anyone.

781
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,160
Try thinking where she likes to go after work?

782
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,680
Or where she hangs out.

783
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,160
Think, man. Try to think.

784
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,559
I went out to pick up the cake

785
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,400
at the new bakery down the road.

786
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,960
I got it.

787
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,520
You know now?

788
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,080
I'm off, too. My boss is gone.

789
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,560
So you know, too?

790
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,800
Wait for me.

791
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,080
Thian is here. What do we do?

792
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,360
- He is almost here. - Only 15% left.

793
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,800
We have to leave now. He's here.

794
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,520
- What? - Let's go.

795
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,200
- What's wrong? - Why did it fail?

796
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,040
We have to go now.

797
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,800
Everybody, go. Don't worry about me.

798
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,160
- No way. - Just go.

799
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,320
- All right, we go now. - Let's go.

800
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,920
- Kob. - Come on.

801
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,160
Moei!

802
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,720
Moei!

803
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,120
Thian. Oh, man!

804
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,400
Thian!

805
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,520
- Come on. Hurry up! - Wait for Moei.

806
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,600
Come on, run.

807
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,280
Moei.

808
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,840
- Moei! - Thian!

809
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,840
He's right behind us.

810
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,159
- Come on. - Kob, you go ahead.

811
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,440
- Go on, Kob. - I'm not going.

812
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,040
I won't let him do anything to you.

813
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,479
Kob, he won't do anything.

814
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,040
- He's getting close, see? - Why won't he?

815
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,880
Because he is my husband!

816
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,040
It's the truth.

817
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,720
Hold on. They're talking.

818
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,160
Do you have anything to say?

819
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,280
Come with me.

820
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,440
Wait.

821
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,440
I'll go with you. I'm Moei's supervisor.

822
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,320
I'm the one who's at fault.

823
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,080
If you want to make amends,

824
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,320
go home

825
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,680
and pack your bags.

826
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,840
You're all leaving to Dawei tomorrow.

827
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,880
Except for you.

828
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,760
You have to clean up your mess first.

829
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,960
Kob, don't worry about me.

830
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,880
Take the others to Dawei.

831
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,160
I'll deal with everything here.

832
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,280
I'm being very kind

833
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,479
by not pressing charges.

834
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,640
So, please

835
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,800
cooperate with me.

836
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,960
What are you doing? Thian?

837
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,600
- What are you doing? - Come here.

838
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,320
What are you doing?

839
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,080
Do you have any idea how much damage you've caused?

840
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,360
I'm very disappointed in you.

841
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,040
- What? - Where's your phone?

842
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,360
- No. - Where's your phone?

843
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,440
I'm not telling you.

844
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,440
Thian. No.

845
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,000
Thian, what are you doing? Let go.

846
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,360
I'm grounding you.

847
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,920
- You can't contact anyone. - What?

848
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,280
No, Thian.

849
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,040
Sir.

850
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,959
We've been notified.

851
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,159
- Natheerin was caught by Thiarawat... - What?

852
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,559
- While getting information for us. - Cease all contact with her.

853
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,600
Yes, sir.

854
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,360
What are you going to do now?

855
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,080
Exactly.

856
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,959
Mr. Baramee and Chet are both abroad.

857
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,200
We'll have to wait until they come back.

858
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,240
Then we tell them about Moei.

859
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,480
So Mr. Thada had Moei steal the master plan

860
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,040
for the Hong Kong skyscraper.

861
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,720
As their employer

862
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,680
wants to build another high-rise to compete with our client.

863
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,440
If they want it so much,

864
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,400
I'll send them the plans.

865
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,720
Right now,

866
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,640
high-rise buildings are popping up everywhere.

867
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,639
It's normal for rival companies

868
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,920
to want to know each other's secrets.

869
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,920
But life isn't that easy.

870
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,520
You can't hope to succeed

871
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,320
by stealing other people's work.

872
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,640
You're right.

873
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,160
So now,

874
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,000
we'll deal with those involved.

875
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,520
And tomorrow,

876
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,240
the Hammoc crews will be leaving to Dawei.

877
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,919
That only leaves Moei.

878
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,920
Just don't be too harsh with her, okay?

879
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,760
She probably did it without realizing the consequences.

880
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,680
She's too old for that excuse.

881
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,240
Actually, I'm planning to go extra harsh on her.

882
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,600
Jeez.

883
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,480
Come on, let's have a drink.

884
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,040
- Yes. - We've already caught one culprit.

885
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,600
- Let's celebrate. - It's a good thing, right?

886
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,920
- Okay, let's do it. - Come on. Show me what you got.

887
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,280
- Oh, wow. - Wait.

888
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,480
The battle is not yet over.

889
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,400
Jeez, why are you so tense?

890
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,359
Don't worry. You'll win for sure.

891
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,160
Ever since I've known you,

892
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,800
you've never lost to anyone.

893
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,960
Beer is right.

894
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,520
- Right. - Come on.

895
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,840
Then I'll go get the glasses.

896
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,920
Nice.

897
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,920
Be quick.

898
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:30,720
You're getting glasses. I'll get the plates.

899
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,240
Good idea.

900
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,560
Nott gets glasses. Toon gets plates.

901
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,160
Then I'll keep you company.

902
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,640
He plans to let me starve in here or what.

903
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,920
Thian is so mean.

904
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,600
You're so mean to me.

905
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,120
Oh, wow, Thian wants another.

906
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,519
- Pour some for him. - I'm about to pass out.

907
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,199
There you go.

908
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,280
Hey.

909
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:57,200
Thian, if we get you drunk

910
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,680
and you end up in the same room as Moei,

911
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,599
who's going to make the first move?

912
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,759
From his face that I've known a long time,

913
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,760
I'll bet you a thousand that he'll make the first move.

914
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,040
I'll bet two thousand on Moei.

915
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,680
Hey, Thian.

916
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:15,319
if you keep drinking like this, and when you wake up tomorrow

917
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,920
you might get a real wife.

918
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,520
If that happens,

919
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,000
what's wrong with it?

920
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,520
Does he know what he just said?

921
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,640
Exactly.

922
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,720
I thought he didn't care about Moei.

923
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,480
I think he's completely wasted.

924
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,640
- Yeah. - I thought so too.

925
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,640
- Top me up. - Yes, sir.

926
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:14,720
All right.

927
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,920
It won't be worse than a broken bone.

928
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,280
I won't starve myself in here.

929
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,280
Oyua.

930
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,519
Is that you or is it a dog?

931
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,960
That wasn't me.

932
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,760
Is there a dog here, Thian?

933
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,400
Don't mind that.

934
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,640
It barks to nonsense like that every day.

935
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,680
- Forget it. - All right.

936
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,760
Oyua.

937
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,840
Quiet.

938
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,640
Do you recognize me now? It's me.

939
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,360
Get back inside. Go, Oyua. Go.

940
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,240
Yes, go.

941
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,000
What a good boy.

942
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,920
All right, I'll jump.

943
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,600
One.

944
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,280
Two.

945
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,960
Three.

946
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,680
One.

947
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,000
Two.

948
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,800
Three.

949
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,280
Thian.

950
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,880
So Oyua was barking at a thief.

951
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,960
Thian, let me go now.

952
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,680
Thian.

953
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,040
Let me go now.

954
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,080
Hey.

955
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,320
How did you get down here?

956
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,360
Are you a monkey? Hmm?

957
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,560
Please, let go of me.

958
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,120
Hey.

959
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,520
Can't you stay still?

960
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,160
Let me go now.

961
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,640
Thian.

962
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,480
Let go of me.

963
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,520
No, Thian!

964
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,240
- Let's go, man. - Slowly does it.

965
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,480
- Oh, it's last step now. - Hey, Thian.

966
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,679
- Hey, man. - We'll head home now.

967
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,240
- Let go. - Stay still.

968
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,200
- Let me go. - We are leaving now.

969
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,199
Hey, can you guys not sway?

970
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,480
Why are you carrying her like that?

971
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,840
I told you to be gentle.

972
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,080
- He' right. - Wait.

973
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,400
How are you going to go home this wasted?

974
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,280
Don't worry about that.

975
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:06,160
We've called a taxi.

976
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,320
That's right.

977
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:11,920
- Let's go. - Bye, Thian. Bye, Moei.

978
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,759
- Goodbye. - Good night.

979
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,920
- Have a good night. - Goodbye.

980
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,239
- Bye, everyone. - Good night, we'll be going.

981
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,000
- Oh, stalactite. - Okay.

982
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,960
- Come on. - Let's go.

983
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,119
- It's this way. - We came from that way.

984
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,720
Why didn't you tell the car to come this way?

985
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,800
Let me go now, Thian.

986
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,599
So you don't like being locked up comfortably?

987
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,920
Do I need to chain you up?

988
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:42,919
Hey, what were you thinking?

989
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,960
Think? I couldn't think of anything,

990
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,120
I am too hungry to think of anything right now.

991
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,680
I'm starving. I could eat a horse.

992
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,320
You are so mean.

993
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,680
I hate you.

994
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,680
Tomorrow,

995
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
be prepared to get a new job.

996
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,840
Moei.

997
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,680
Moei.

998
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,160
Moei.

999
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,520
Get up.

1000
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,240
Here, call Matthana and say as I tell you.

1001
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,360
You have to get back all of my files.

1002
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,400
How am I supposed to do that?

1003
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,960
I have a plan. Just make the call.

1004
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,000
Go on.

1005
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,919
Are you going to call her or not?

1006
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,320
- It hurts. - Does that hurt? Seriously?

1007
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,319
This is nothing compared to the troubles you've caused me.

1008
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,080
- Take this. - Hey, that hurts.

1009
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,880
Can you call now?

1010
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,120
Okay, I'll do it.

1011
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,320
Welcome to call-back service.

1012
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,200
Her phone is turned off.

1013
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,080
Try again.

1014
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,520
Call her again.

1015
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,480
Welcome to call-back service.

1016
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,760
- What? - Her phone is turned off.

1017
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,920
You can try it...

1018
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,080
You can try if you don't believe me.

1019
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,040
I didn't send her the latest file.

1020
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,280
She probably thinks

1021
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,040
I got into problem, so she ceased all our contact.

1022
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,800
That's fine.

1023
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,000
I know where I can find that woman.

1024
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,760
- Get ready. - Hmm?

1025
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,880
We're going out.

1026
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Let's go.

1027
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,600
Where are you going?

1028
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:27,160
My leg is still tied up. How am I supposed to move?

1029
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:28,520
Thian.

1030
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,880
I can't move, so I'm not going.

1031
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,880
Jeez, can't you untie it yourself?

1032
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,200
Look.

1033
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,520
The key is right here.

1034
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,760
I see you're all grumpy.

1035
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,800
Go and take a shower.

1036
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,800
This is Matthana's condo.

1037
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,200
How do you know where she lives?

1038
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,040
How do you know where she lives?

1039
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,280
- Oh, there he is. - Hey.

1040
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,600
Oh, man.

1041
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,760
- What are you saying? - Wait.

1042
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,520
Matthana is a masochist.

1043
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,880
She loves violence.

1044
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:28,080
She's also a sadist. She whipped my back and butt.

1045
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,560
I was trying to find out your secret

1046
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,120
from Matthana.

1047
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,000
My secret?

1048
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,720
You have no idea that someone had to...

1049
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,080
What someone had to do

1050
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,080
to gather evidence against you.

1051
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,080
Get out.

1052
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,160
Get out.

1053
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,360
Oh, Ms. Matthana.

1054
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,200
Ms. Natheerin.

1055
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,200
How did you know where I live?

1056
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,080
I have something to discuss with you.

1057
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,240
But you couldn't fulfill your duty,

1058
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,920
so all agreements are void now.

1059
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,200
We have nothing to discuss anymore.

1060
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,400
But I have the plan file

1061
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,520
for the Hong Kong skyscraper.

1062
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,200
Do you really have it?

1063
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,760
Yes.

1064
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,840
But my situation is not so good right now,

1065
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,640
so I'd like you to tell Mr. Thada

1066
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,320
that I have

1067
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,120
a condition.

1068
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,000
Natheerin wants to move to our company

1069
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,960
in exchange for the files on the Hong Kong skyscraper?

1070
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:00,360
Yes, she said she didn't want to go to Dawei.

1071
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,920
So she wants to quit.

1072
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,640
Are you certain that she has the file?

1073
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,160
Yes.

1074
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,160
She sent us a part of it.

1075
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:16,280
If you agree to have her work here, she'll give us the rest.

1076
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,360
Do you think this woman may have a plan?

1077
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:24,800
What are you talking about?

1078
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,760
You seem tense, Father.

1079
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:38,600
We're considering having Natheerin work for us.

1080
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:42,080
Why would you want that man's wife here?

1081
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:45,560
Because she has the file on Thiarawat's project that we want.

1082
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,120
But I'm not sure if she's plotting something.

1083
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,600
Then agree to her term.

1084
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,000
Is that a good idea?

1085
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,840
Of course.

1086
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,600
It's better to keep our enemies close.

1087
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,120
Also,

1088
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,760
if this Natheerin were to betray us,

1089
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,800
I'd take care of her

1090
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,920
the same way I did to your daughter.

1091
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,400
Thian,

1092
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,520
are you really going to send me there?

1093
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,000
Don't play the victim here.

1094
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,800
You caused this mess.

1095
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,160
It's your responsibility.

1096
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,760
But if Mr. Thada caught me,

1097
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,160
he could literally kill me.

1098
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,240
You just have to make it out alive.

1099
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:23,840
Sit down.

1100
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,520
Remember, this as a lesson

1101
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,640
so you don't do it again.

1102
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,480
Got it ?

1103
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,000
Your job is to infiltrate the company,

1104
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,960
gain everyone's trust,

1105
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,840
and get my files out as soon as possible.

1106
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,240
Yes.

1107
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,680
Ms. Natheerin.

1108
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,640
Hello, Ms. Matthana.

1109
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,280
- Please come this way. - Yes.

1110
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:54,520
As I've told you, your job here won't be that of an interior designer.

1111
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,159
Your job is to hack into the servers

1112
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,000
of all our competitors.

1113
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,760
Of course, you will keep this a secret.

1114
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,360
The employees here only know that you're just a new interior designer.

1115
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,400
Yes.

1116
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,520
Everyone,

1117
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,120
this is Ms. Natheerin, or Moei.

1118
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,320
- Hello. - Hello.

1119
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,840
Please give her a warm welcome.

1120
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,159
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

1121
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:31,000
- Likewise. Have a seat. - All right.

1122
01:34:34,365 --> 01:34:36,239
- Moei. - Yes?

1123
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,640
You used to work at TPC?

1124
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,240
That's right.

1125
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,560
So you must know TecTien, right?

1126
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,600
Well, a little bit.

1127
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,520
What is he like?

1128
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,120
Does he have a girlfriend?

1129
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:50,680
Come on, a hot guy like him

1130
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:53,640
wouldn't go steady with anyone that easily.

1131
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,280
- You know the time when he... - Hey, girls.

1132
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,520
But the secretary told me

1133
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,640
that she bedded him at the last seminar.

1134
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:05,920
- What? - What?

1135
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,000
Why didn't I know about this?

1136
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,079
How would you know?

1137
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,519
She didn't dare tell anyone

1138
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,160
because another girl in the office

1139
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,080
also announced that she wanted TecTien.

1140
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,640
But she finally told me herself right before she quit.

1141
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,560
Don't get involved with a guy like that.

1142
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,160
He must have been with so many women.

1143
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,159
I don't know him that well.

1144
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,440
No, not well at all.

1145
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:32,600
Good. I'll find someone for you, okay?

1146
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,919
- Okay. - What a lousy guy.

1147
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,280
- He's a big no. - Okay.

1148
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,480
Hey, why still no progress?

1149
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,400
I told you not to waste any time

1150
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,480
and get my files back as soon as possible.

1151
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,320
I'm trying,

1152
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,640
but it's not that easy.

1153
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:58,480
Coming from someone who hacked into an entire company.

1154
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,560
This shouldn't be too hard for someone like you.

1155
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,760
If you're in such a hurry, do it yourself.

1156
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,160
What did you say?

1157
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,520
Nothing.

1158
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:18,840
Here's the key.

1159
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,920
My ear hurts.

1160
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,960
It's like there's a fly my ear.

1161
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,639
You've been doing nothing for two hours.

1162
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:08,840
Do something.

1163
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,320
Thian, stop asking so many questions.

1164
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,600
They will think I'm talking to myself.

1165
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,040
Tomorrow, you go with this communication device.

1166
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,320
So I can contact you at all times.

1167
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,880
I'll go out for a bit.

1168
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,680
This hurts too much.

1169
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,720
Thian.

1170
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,360
Just stop yelling. I'm about to go deaf.

1171
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,480
Then go see Mr. Thada.

1172
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,080
And reposition the camera. I don't want to see your boobs.

1173
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:59,000
Listen. If you're in such a hurry,

1174
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,240
why don't you come here yourself?

1175
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,319
I assure you,

1176
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,760
once we get back, I'm telling Ri everything.

1177
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,080
Is that what you want?

1178
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:07,400
All right.

1179
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:10,840
Then I'll tell Ri the heartfelt, romantic things you said about me.

1180
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,200
Do you want that?

1181
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,240
Thian.

1182
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:15,600
Listen.

1183
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,440
If I get caught,

1184
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,400
won't I get shot to death?

1185
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:26,320
Don't forget that I'm an only child.

1186
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:27,680
If something happens to me,

1187
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,399
who will take care of my mom?

1188
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:32,720
Oh, I must have forgot you are wearing a bulletproof vest.

1189
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:36,200
What? We have that?

1190
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:39,080
Didn't Sathit tell you that we did?

1191
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,760
Gosh, Thian, you are really...

1192
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:56,840
Finally,

1193
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:00,320
we're team now, Ms. Natheerin.

1194
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:09,480
Moei.

1195
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,080
You do realize that that man is Pondej, right?

1196
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:15,080
Be careful.

1197
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,359
So this is

1198
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,360
the person who will become my right hand.

1199
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,240
So I think it might have been a mistake

1200
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,680
for my father-in-law to hire you to work for us.

1201
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,720
Moei, get me that laptop's IP address.

1202
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,319
The plan file of our Hong Kong skyscraper, I got it back.

1203
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,999
It's time to tell him the truth.

1204
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,280
What truth?

1205
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,880
I hate traitors.

1206
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,080
But as your husband,

1207
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:58,800
I consider you've done a terrible mistake as a wife.
