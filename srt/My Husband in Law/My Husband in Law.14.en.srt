1
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,320
What about me saving her life?

2
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,080
- How didn't I take care of her? - Shut up.

3
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,720
What you did was nothing compared to what she did for you.

4
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,560
She jumped into the water to save you.

5
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,720
What is it that ties you up

6
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
and keeps you from falling for anyone else

7
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
except Thian?

8
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,880
I am sorry, Moei.

9
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,360
Where is Thian?

10
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,080
Moei, wait. Where are you going?

11
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,880
Doctor said you need to stay longer.

12
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,040
So, you and me can find out

13
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,080
if we had to stay apart,

14
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,000
would we still love each other.

15
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,920
Mom.

16
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,240
- Aunt Pha, Hello. - Hello.

17
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,480
Moei and the babies are safe.

18
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,000
Mom.

19
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,200
You rascal.

20
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,720
Mom.

21
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,640
Aunt Jee.

22
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,440
Hello.

23
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,960
Greetings, Dear.

24
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,240
How are you feeling?

25
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,520
I was so shocked when Thian called me, you know.

26
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,360
Aunt Jee.

27
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,280
We're really sorry for not telling you earlier.

28
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
It's all right. I'm not mad at you at all.

29
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,520
It's someone else I should be mad at.

30
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
And it's the one

31
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,960
who caused this whole mess.

32
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,840
Look. Right now, you are not alone now.

33
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,880
You have this little one in your belly.

34
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm worried about you.

35
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,560
Please come back with me.

36
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,080
So you'll have someone to take care of you. Okay?

37
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,760
But Aunt Jee,

38
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'd really like to stay here.

39
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,680
I'd like to stay in the garden house.

40
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,040
I'd like to spend some time alone.

41
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,880
I feel happier that way.

42
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,960
Fine, I'll send my people to stay with you.

43
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,320
How many would you like?

44
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,519
Or would you like Thian to stay with you as a guard dog?

45
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,680
Hmm?

46
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,560
I'd really like to be alone.

47
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,920
And I…

48
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,120
don't want to go anywhere right now.

49
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,680
Mom.

50
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,479
Once Moei can get discharged,

51
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,720
I'll take her home.

52
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,720
Calm down, will you?

53
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,240
Didn't you hear she wants to stay here?

54
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,960
No, Mom. I'm worried about her.

55
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Where's Sathit?

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,640
You tell him to get the car ready.

57
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,280
Thian, you say you're worried about her.

58
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,040
Do you even care how she feels?

59
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
Even now, you're still trying to force her?

60
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,360
Haven't you learned anything at all?

61
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
Want her to run away again?

62
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,400
Is that what you want? Then go ahead and do whatever you want.

63
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,600
Mom, wait.

64
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,800
Look.

65
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
Think.

66
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,800
Pull yourself together, will you? All right?

67
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,080
What do you suggest me do?

68
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,000
She's with child.

69
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,400
She can't be alone.

70
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,240
I don't care.

71
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,640
She can be mad at me, threaten me all she wants.

72
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,760
Today, she has to leave with me.

73
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,920
Thian.

74
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,319
You've been with her since high school.

75
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,399
Now you're having a child together.

76
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,960
But you don't know her at all.

77
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,280
You always got your way all this time

78
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,360
only because she lets you,

79
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,280
not because you're tough or anything.

80
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,240
Don't flatter yourself.

81
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,920
Moei is an iron fist in a velvet glove.

82
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,280
Didn't you see how she handled Pondej?

83
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,280
Jeez.

84
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
What should I do

85
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,920
so she let me take care of her?

86
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,200
It's your job to figure it out, not mine.

87
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,960
She has done so much for you.

88
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,320
Why don't you prove you can do the same for her?

89
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,880
What are you going to do next?

90
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,400
Huh?

91
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Are you going to give up?

92
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,320
Can you not be so quiet?

93
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,080
Just tell us how you feel.

94
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,720
I won't give up.

95
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,080
- Yes! - That's my man.

96
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
I have to get Moei to forgive me

97
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,879
and give me another chance.

98
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,320
That's what I'm talking about.

99
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
But if you go see her like you did before,

100
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,600
she'll just run away.

101
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,680
If I can't see her, what else I can do?

102
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,960
I have a plan.

103
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,840
(Baan Suan Romruen)

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,200
Oh. Oh my.

105
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,560
It's been a while since I've seen guys around here.

106
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,320
- Hi. - Hi.

107
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,719
- Is this Moei's house? - That's right.

108
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,960
Well, are you here to see her?

109
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,800
- You're Gig, right? - Yes, that's me.

110
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,920
Gig, I'd like to ask for your help on something.

111
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,479
Sure, anything.

112
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,240
I promise that if you help us,

113
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,440
I'll give you anything you want.

114
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,400
- Really? - Yes.

115
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,560
Anything?

116
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,960
Anything.

117
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Get me his Facebook.

118
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,040
His Facebook?

119
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,960
You need to work that smell though.

120
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,120
You little....

121
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,720
Okay, give me your phone.

122
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,800
This one, right?

123
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,120
- This one. - What?

124
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,160
- Just give it to her. - Well.

125
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
Do it quick.

126
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,800
Here you are.

127
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,960
Wait.

128
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,040
Now that I helped you,

129
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,040
you'll have to help me as promised.

130
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,920
Sure.

131
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,720
He's so cute. Oh, his Facebook!

132
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
- Got anything? - Have I ever let you down?

133
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
Moei's schedule.

134
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,880
Yes.

135
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,960
At 6 am, she gives food to the monks.

136
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,640
After that, she goes shopping.

137
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,600
During this time, Gig comes to clean the house.

138
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,240
Sometimes, she prepares food for Moei.

139
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Moei gets home around mid-morning.

140
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,760
And takes a half-hour nap.

141
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,280
In the afternoon, she either works or arranges flowers.

142
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,120
Around 5 pm, she takes a walk.

143
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,959
Yes.

144
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,400
Gig says she does the same things every day.

145
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,240
She doesn't do anything else.

146
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,760
So you should know by now

147
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,840
the time you can go to Moei's house is…

148
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,320
late morning.

149
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,399
That's right.

150
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,119
If everything goes as planned,

151
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,920
Moei is all yours.

152
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,480
Oh.

153
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,000
- Whoa! - Gig.

154
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,160
- Are you surprised in my beauty?

155
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,480
Keep your voice down.

156
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
We weren't surprised, but terrified.

157
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,960
Hey, what did you say?

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,960
Oh, I said I wanted to eat some fries.

159
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
Here, the key to Moei's house.

160
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,960
- Thank you. - Of course.

161
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,920
Oh, there she is.

162
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,040
Hey, what now?

163
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,160
Come on.

164
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,760
Gosh!

165
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,280
Thian, go.

166
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,120
She has done so much for you.

167
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,480
Why don't you prove you can do the same for her?

168
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,680
Gig.

169
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,520
- Thank you. - Hmm? For what?

170
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,400
For these, of course.

171
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,520
White rose is my favorite flower.

172
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,640
- I see. - How did you know?

173
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,639
Come on. I have the sixth sense.

174
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,800
I know it all what you like don't like.

175
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,840
You don't believe me, do you?

176
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,720
You'll see in the next days.

177
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,320
I'll go clean the house.

178
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,600
So pretty.

179
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Gig must think I might slip.

180
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,400
How thoughtful of her.

181
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,040
Moei keeps thanking me.

182
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,320
For the flowers, for the food,

183
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,120
and the latest, the non-slip mat.

184
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,040
It's good that she thinks it's you.

185
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,440
She doesn't need to know it's me.

186
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,560
- Mr. Thian. - Thanks.

187
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,080
So, does she seem happy?

188
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,520
She's very happy, I'd say.

189
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,040
You know, she seems a lot happier

190
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,040
than when she first moved in.

191
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,080
Thian. Well, I'm really curious,

192
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
aren't you tired

193
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,880
since you got up so early and took care of Moei's house,

194
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,800
then went to work after that?

195
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,000
Aren't you tired?

196
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,560
Hello?

197
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,320
Yes. Uh... I'm listening.

198
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,080
A little closer, Dear.

199
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,480
Just come closer, Dear. He won't bite.

200
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,560
Hope you don't mind me take this photo.

201
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,880
I want to remember the first day I came in this house.

202
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,760
(I'm pregnant!)

203
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,440
Today is the day I learn...

204
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,520
I'm carrying you inside me.

205
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,800
I was pretty shocked at first.

206
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,520
But in that shock,

207
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,560
I was filled with happiness beyond words.

208
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,680
All this time, I have been through so much.

209
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,880
Haven't Aunt Jee told you

210
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,080
that I'm going abroad to study.

211
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,600
Have you forgotten why we got married?

212
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,600
Let's get a divorce.

213
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,160
Thank you for letting me live

214
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,400
so I can learn what love is.

215
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,080
Where is he going?

216
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,160
He's going to Hong Kong.

217
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,720
I didn't really know what to do next.

218
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,240
I couldn't see my future.

219
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,600
All my life,

220
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,120
I never had any idea

221
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,680
if I could love anyone more than him.

222
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,120
You're six weeks pregnant.

223
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,400
Congratulations.

224
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,160
During the first three months,

225
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,560
you should take several precautions

226
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,040
to reduce the risk of a miscarriage.

227
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,200
For example, stress and certain diets.

228
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,639
For long-distance travel, if possible,

229
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,640
I suggest you avoid it or have it postponed.

230
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
But when I found out that you were here with me,

231
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,400
I have realized that I still

232
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,040
have much more love to give you.

233
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,120
I've chosen this home to raise you in.

234
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,560
As it feels warm

235
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,360
like the home in my memory.

236
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
where I was once happy

237
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,960
while sharing my life with someone.

238
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,760
I promise.

239
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,360
I'll do my best to take care of myself for you.

240
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,720
Six months from now,

241
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
we'll finally meet.

242
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,720
Please send your love to cheer for me.

243
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,760
Gig.

244
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,560
Gig.

245
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,440
Have you seen my phone anywhere?

246
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,320
Where did I put it?

247
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,480
Gig.

248
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,520
She isn't here?

249
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,400
(Please come to Moei's now. She is back.)

250
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,240
Why does the door open?

251
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,720
Gig.

252
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,040
Moei!

253
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,320
Moei, I'm here!

254
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm here! Oh, my.

255
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,320
I had to rush here. I was in the back.

256
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,640
What's the matter?

257
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,360
Oh.

258
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,560
I was actually swimming off your dock.

259
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,959
You caught me red-handed.

260
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,200
Yeah, I see you really rushed here.

261
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,680
Oh.

262
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,560
So why did you come back?

263
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,960
Right, I forgot my phone.

264
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,280
No, wait! You want your phone?

265
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,040
- Yes. - I'll get it for you.

266
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,840
- There you go. - Thank you.

267
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,840
You have to see the client, don't you?

268
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,520
Then you should leave now.

269
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,680
The traffic is bad, now.

270
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,240
Come on. Leave now.

271
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,480
- Okay. - Be safe, okay?

272
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,440
Oh, right.

273
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,320
Hang on. What else do you want?

274
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,800
- My laptop. - Oh, your laptop.

275
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,120
Have it.

276
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,080
Go now, or you'll be stuck in traffic.

277
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,640
- Don't forget anything else, okay? Go on. - Okay.

278
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,080
- Bye. - Bye.

279
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,000
She's gone.

280
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, this is so tiring.

281
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,200
Gosh, finally.

282
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,319
You know, you almost gave me a heart attack.

283
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
Thank you, Gig.

284
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,320
Wait, hold on. I'm curious.

285
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,800
How long are you going to keep doing this?

286
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,600
Moei really has no idea

287
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
what you've been doing here.

288
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm also curious.

289
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,840
How can this get Moei to forgive you?

290
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't expect Moei to forgive me.

291
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,679
I just don't want to see her work so hard like before.

292
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,240
Oh, wow. What a gentleman.

293
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,400
You are a real gentleman.

294
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,360
- Please excuse me. - Sure, go ahead.

295
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,320
Oh, my.

296
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,840
What a gentleman.

297
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,240
Look at me, I couldn't even put my clothes on.

298
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,120
This is where I left off.

299
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Oh.

300
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
What is it now?

301
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,640
Hello? Moei, is that you?

302
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,760
Gig.

303
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Have you done something with my crochet piece?

304
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,760
No, not a bit.

305
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,480
What's the matter, Moei?

306
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,360
No, it's nothing.

307
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,919
White rose is my favorite flower.

308
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,040
- I see. - How did you know?

309
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,040
Come on. I have the sixth sense.

310
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,320
I know it all what you like and don't like.

311
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,200
There you are.

312
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,040
It's just what I thought.

313
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,920
There you are.

314
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
It's just what I thought.

315
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,440
I told you, didn't I?

316
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,760
That I don't want you here again.

317
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,520
But I'm here now. What are you going to do?

318
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,240
Why can't you understand?

319
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Do you think I was so stupid

320
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,560
to fool me like this?

321
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,520
If you were, you wouldn't be able to make me love you.

322
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,320
If I asked you directly,

323
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,720
you wouldn't have let me.

324
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,280
So what is it that you want?

325
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,200
- Are you going to leave or not? - No.

326
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,320
I think I've made myself clear.

327
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,400
If you followed me here,

328
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,960
I would run away again.

329
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,240
Do you think I can't do it?

330
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Right.

331
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,040
I forgot

332
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,760
that you don't know me well enough.

333
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,600
I know you well enough.

334
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,760
You were born on September 19.

335
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,120
You like white roses.

336
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,840
You like listening me playing guitar.

337
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,280
- You like to eat... - That's enough.

338
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,400
If you knew me well,

339
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,240
you wouldn't keep doing this.

340
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,440
I always thought you had a kind heart.

341
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,480
It turned out you were even colder than me?

342
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,920
Didn't you say you loved me?

343
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,600
Didn't you promise you'd love only me?

344
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,040
That's why I was afraid

345
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,559
that if I gave my heart to someone.

346
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,080
They would toy and throw it away.

347
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,240
That's why I'm afraid to love.

348
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
Don't ever think that this is enough

349
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,520
for me to let you go.

350
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,120
You can drive me away all you want, but I'm not leaving you.

351
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,320
Wherever you and the babies are,

352
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,560
that's where I'll be.

353
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,160
Loud and clear?

354
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,080
- I'll move in. - No, you can't do that.

355
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,960
I told you.

356
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,160
I wanted to be here alone.

357
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,520
I'm not leaving.

358
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,080
I won't go anywhere until you let me stay.

359
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,079
Fine, I'll call the police.

360
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,759
Go on, do it.

361
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,200
- No, Moei. - I'm doing it.

362
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,960
- Moei. - Please go back.

363
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,599
She's really calling.

364
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,160
Hello, Officer.

365
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,920
There's an intruder in my house.

366
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,440
Please go, I'm begging you.

367
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,920
It's Baan Suan Romruen.

368
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,360
- Please. - In Nakhon Pathom.

369
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,960
Please hang up, Moei.

370
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,120
- Oh. - Thian, why are you still here?

371
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,880
You told me to get out, didn't you?

372
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,240
I'll be at the dock.

373
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,719
You need to go now.

374
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
No.

375
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Please be careful.

376
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Moei.

377
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Moei.

378
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,000
What the heck?

379
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,440
So you knew all along about what he's been doing?

380
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,320
I saw how determined he was. He was trying so hard.

381
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,400
But Thian and I had an agreement.

382
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,600
You might have an agreement,

383
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,760
and it might feel right for you.

384
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,360
But what about the babies?

385
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Whatever you and Thian

386
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,760
agreed on or decided to do,

387
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
your babies know nothing about it.

388
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,880
Right now, it's not just you.

389
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,320
Whatever you do, you have to think about the babies,

390
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,320
not yourself.

391
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,040
Do you understand?

392
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,360
Right now, it's not just you.

393
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,960
Whatever you do, you have to think about the babies,

394
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,760
not yourself.

395
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,319
If you knew me well,

396
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,480
you wouldn't keep doing this.

397
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,840
You say you're worried about her.

398
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,520
Do you even care how she feels?

399
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,479
Even now, you're still trying to force her?

400
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,800
Haven't you learned anything at all?

401
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,400
Want her to run again?

402
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,080
Moei is an iron fist in a velvet glove.

403
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,560
Didn't you see?

404
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,040
The first boat leaves at 6 am.

405
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Moei.

406
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,960
So, our work here is complete.

407
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,560
- Right, that part there? - Yes.

408
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,720
So we'll work on this part now and...

409
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,720
about all these things, you can…

410
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,960
Aren't you feeling well, Mr. Thian?

411
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,480
About these…

412
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,680
Mr. Thian.

413
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,840
Mr. Thian.

414
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,480
I think you should go get some rest.

415
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,840
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

416
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,800
What are you doing? Thian, what's the matter?

417
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,200
Thian, what's wrong?

418
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,760
Oh, my.

419
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,680
Are you having indigestion?

420
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,160
Need help?

421
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,160
Oh, gosh.

422
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,840
Oh, that's why.

423
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,440
You don't have a lot of morning sickness

424
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,640
because someone gets it for you.

425
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,160
Don't tell me you are having sympathy pain for your wife.

426
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,400
Thian.

427
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,680
Maybe you should go home and rest.

428
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,640
- Gig? - Yes?

429
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,000
Do you think he can make it home?

430
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,440
He has to ride on a boat and then a bus.

431
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,039
No, Moei. No bus or boat is needed.

432
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,720
He can walk. He lives back here.

433
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,160
- What? - Oh.

434
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,439
It's so cozy and pleasant here.

435
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,879
You see, the owner of this place

436
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,680
got a job abroad.

437
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,560
So he asked me to rent it out.

438
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,799
Can I move in right now?

439
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,640
Wow, you're just as impatient as Moei.

440
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,160
That's easy. Show me the money, and the key is yours.

441
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,760
That's right. I rented it to him.

442
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,120
So he's close by.

443
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,400
Oh, poor you.

444
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Thian.

445
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,880
Thian.

446
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,040
Thian.

447
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,200
Thian.

448
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,160
Moei.

449
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
You're here.

450
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,040
Why do you look so startled?

451
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,319
I'm sorry. I was still hazy.

452
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,080
That's okay. I like it.

453
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,280
Moei asked me to check in on you.

454
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,320
She is probably worried that you might get sick.

455
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,239
Oh.

456
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,080
Oh.

457
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,960
That's a real deal, new daddy.

458
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,240
Oh, my.

459
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,160
You know what's weird?

460
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,560
You can't stop puking.

461
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,959
But Moei can't stop eating.

462
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,880
She eats all day.

463
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,840
I just came back from work,

464
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,160
so I bought you some food.

465
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,000
I hear you have good appetite. Here, I got your favorite.

466
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,000
But if you don't like it, I can go buy you something else.

467
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,600
You're hungry, aren't you?

468
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,240
- What would you like? I'll plate it. - Thian, don't come near me.

469
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,720
You smell bad.

470
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,120
Moei.

471
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,520
Moei.

472
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,880
Moei.

473
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,120
Moei.

474
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,880
Moei.

475
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,480
What's wrong, Moei?

476
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,280
Moei. Gosh, Moei.

477
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,120
Moei. Gosh, Moei.

478
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,080
Why did you push me away?

479
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,880
Moei! Hey!

480
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,480
Moei.

481
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,680
It's just her allergic reaction to her husband.

482
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,519
That's why when she sees your face,

483
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,000
she wants to puke. Got it?

484
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,520
- Is that possible? - Of course.

485
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,200
Pregnant women have all kinds of things happening to them.

486
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,880
Got it? They can even hate the things they love.

487
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,880
You know what I think? You and Moei...

488
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,560
are having same pregnancy symptoms at the same time.

489
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,000
You know what this means?

490
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,399
It means you love each other so much.

491
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,280
That's why you're sharing the pains.

492
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,400
Mom, you know what I'm laughing about?

493
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,640
No.

494
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,680
Then why are you laughing?

495
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,040
I made you rice porridge. It's still hot.

496
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,440
You should eat now.

497
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,000
Uh, wait.

498
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,880
So, what's wrong with you?

499
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,599
What's with the mask?

500
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,720
Well.

501
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,160
You saw my face and you puked yesterday.

502
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,240
So I cover it up.

503
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,280
You won't puke.

504
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,520

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,960
You have checkup today?

506
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,680
It's at 1 pm.

507
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,880
Then, I'll…

508
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,600
I'll pick you up at noon.

509
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,360
I'll be quick at work.

510
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,960
Then I'll hurry back.

511
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,040
You're now 16 weeks pregnant.

512
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,840
That's four months.

513
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,280
Today, we're going to do the ultrasound to see the baby's development.

514
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,120
What's wrong, Moei?

515
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,440
I'm afraid the babies might miss a leg.

516
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
It doesn't matter.

517
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,880
No matter how it is, they're still our babies.

518
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,200
All right.

519
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,040
Daddy, Mommy, can you see me?

520
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,320
Can you make it out?

521
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,480
Where's the head? Where's the tail?

522
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,879
Mommy is so funny.

523
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,600
There's only a head, no tail.

524
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
That right there, that's the head.

525
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,480
See it? Pretty big head though.

526
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,880
- Hold on. - Yes?

527
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,800
What's that little bud there?

528
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,880
Is that a hand?

529
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,440
I see.

530
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,200
That's not a hand.

531
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,479
That's his willie.

532
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,720
His willie?

533
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,720
Our babies are boys.

534
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,840
Mommy needs to eat a nutritious diet,

535
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,800
and get more rest than usual.

536
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,320
Don't lift heavy objects.

537
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,000
And most importantly,

538
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,080
no sexual intercourse.

539
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,480
Hang in there, Daddy.

540
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,840
Just only five months.

541
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,400
Don't work hard.

542
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,880
Be careful when you walk.

543
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,560
Eat a nutritious diet.

544
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,920
Don't just eat as you please, understand?

545
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,560
When I get off work in the evening,

546
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,440
I'll make you some food.

547
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,400
You don't have to.

548
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,920
I can take care of myself.

549
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,560
You have to work.

550
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,440
The site is close by. I can go there and back.

551
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,560
If I really have to stay on the site,

552
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,320
I'll check on you every hour.

553
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,520
- I'm hungry. - What?

554
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,120
You're hungry?

555
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,200
Hang on.

556
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,480
There you go.

557
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,160
You're hungry, aren't you?

558
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,920
You've changed a lot, you know?

559
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,080
Are you doing all of this for me

560
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,640
because of what I did for you?

561
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,800
Gratitude and love are not the same, you know?

562
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,800
I doubt you might be confused.

563
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,760
Moei, watch out!

564
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,320
Moei!

565
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,960
Moei!

566
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,600
Our babies are boys.

567
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,040
Don't feel sorry.

568
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,120
Don't feel like it holds you responsible.

569
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,800
Just because I'm pregnant.

570
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,360
If you don't love me, even if we have a child together,

571
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,880
it's not going to work out.

572
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,400
If you leave now,

573
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,400
I think I can still get over it.

574
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,200
Look. If your empty stomach makes you think so much,

575
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,520
how about help me think

576
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,000
what I have to do

577
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,800
to make you never get over me.

578
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,680
So,

579
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,640
who was craving an omelet?

580
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,600
Chow down, okay? You have to eat for the babies too.

581
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,760
Here.

582
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,480
Hey.

583
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,320
I'm doing all of this for you,

584
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,200
you still don't know I love you?

585
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Hmm?

586
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,960
Moei.

587
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
Oh.

588
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,240
Oh, Moei.

589
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,880
Moei, what's wrong?

590
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,200
Thian.

591
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,120
From now on, don't ask me

592
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,760
to leave again, okay?

593
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,680
And you should never leave me again, all right?

594
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,640
Let's start a family together.

595
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,640
Moei.

596
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,080
I'll go see Gig first thing in the morning.

597
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,440
I'll cancel apartment contract.

598
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,200
She surely will keep your security deposit.

599
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,600
She can keep it.

600
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,400
No, you can't.

601
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,760
How about this?

602
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,160
I promise.

603
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,560
I won't do anything.

604
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,600
Don't you trust me?

605
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,720
Of course, I trust you.

606
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,680
But I don't trust myself.

607
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,840
I may not be drunk,

608
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
but I can still get turned on.

609
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,520
I told you I won't be able to stop myself.

610
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,040
Oh, wow.

611
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,520
If I hadn't stopped, I would have lost my tee.

612
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,440
Right?

613
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,320
Ouch.

614
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,760
Stop that mouth of yours.

615
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,720
Let's exercise our brain a bit.

616
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,880
If our average age is 75 years old,

617
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,560
that means we have 27,375 days on this earth.

618
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,480
Every minute that passes

619
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,840
is a minute less we have to live.

620
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,720
How should I correct this?

621
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,720
Hey, Kaofang. What are you here for?

622
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,040
To see Kang?

623
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,960
Please give this to her.

624
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,280
What's wrong with her?

625
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,320
Here.

626
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,760
From her to you.

627
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,200
I heard that.

628
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,160
You won't read it?

629
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,680
Put it on my desk.

630
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,200
All right.

631
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,880
You won't read it, right? Then I will.

632
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,200
Hey, Tum. Tum, stop!

633
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,040
What's with her?

634
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,880
Now that we've realized it, it got me thinking,

635
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,960
if you want something, just go for it.

636
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,040
Don't keep waiting just because you're unsure.

637
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,600
If you want to go somewhere, just go.

638
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,960
If you want to do something, just do.

639
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,560
If it causes others problems.

640
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,200
If you want to confess your love, just do it.

641
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,720
Reimbursement documents.

642
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,240
Okay.

643
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,840
Hey, hang on.

644
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,880
I was wondering where Kaofang is.

645
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,439
I went into her office but didn't see her things.

646
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,600
She just quit.

647
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,200
She got her stuff and left just now.

648
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,760
Just now?

649
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,640
Kaofang!

650
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,440
If they reciprocate, your wish is fulfilled.

651
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,880
If they don't, then you can move on.

652
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,760
No more wasting time with uncertainty.

653
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,160
Hey, Kaofang!

654
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,480
Kaofang!

655
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,880
Kaofang!

656
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,560
Kaofang!

657
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,520
- Kang. - Kaofang!

658
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,360
I know you're still mad at me.

659
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,160
I just want to tell you I'm sorry.

660
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,640
I'm really sorry.

661
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,480
I don't expect you to forgive me anymore.

662
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,320
Because what I did was so terrible.

663
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,360
I'm going to quit this job.

664
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,800
I guess you can be happier not seeing me around in the office.

665
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,120
Best of luck to you, Kang.

666
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,240
It's really my pleasure...

667
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,880
to get to know you.

668
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,280
From Kaofang, your awful friend.

669
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,560
So as they say,

670
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,720
you may never realize how much someone means to you

671
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,400
until they are gone.

672
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,840
Will I get a chance to see you again?

673
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,280
If there's something unresolved,

674
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,720
don't wait for them to come to you.

675
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,800
Don't bother thinking about who's right or wrong.

676
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,880
Because if we let the time pass,

677
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,360
we'll be the one who hurts the most.

678
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,960
If there's some misunderstanding,

679
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,840
just let go your pride.

680
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,040
Talk and reconcile.

681
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,480
There should be no win or lose between people who love each other.

682
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,680
If you lose, you both lose.

683
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,000
If you win, you win it together.

684
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,920
Sorry, we don't have any new employees named Natthamon.

685
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,200
Thank you.

686
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,320
Where are you going?

687
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,400
Up to 11th floor to see Mr. Baramee.

688
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,320
Please push Nine for me.

689
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,720
Are you here to pick up your order?

690
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,439
Here you are.

691
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,600
Hey, wait, Mister.

692
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,080
Don't leave yet. That's 60 baht.

693
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,720
You sure it's 60 baht?

694
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,720
20, 40, 60, thank you.

695
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,880
What can I get you?

696
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,000
Kang.

697
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,680
Excuse me, are you going to order?

698
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,160
What can I get you, Miss?

699
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,680
Today, it's "buy one, get one free".

700
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,880
The thing is I don't want any coffee, but…

701
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,880
can I get the barista's heart instead?

702
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,360
It's not for sale.

703
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,119
If you don't sell your heart,

704
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,800
how about we exchange them?

705
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,960
If I give you my heart,

706
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,880
will you give me yours?

707
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,280
About what you wrote in the letter,

708
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,039
that I'll be happier when I don't see you around.

709
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,560
is not true at all, Kaofang.

710
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,400
Since the day you left,

711
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,320
I found no happy moments at all.

712
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,880
I couldn't even smile.

713
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,280
I'm sorry, Kaofang,

714
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,600
for telling you how I feel about you when it's too late.

715
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,360
I know you won't give me a chance.

716
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,720
But that's okay. I understand.

717
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,039
It's me who was being too difficult.

718
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,800
So this served me right.

719
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,480
I came just to tell you this.

720
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,400
Now I see that you're happy.

721
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,920
I am happy for you.

722
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,000
Well, I'd better get going.

723
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,640
Go after her.

724
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,639
Just go.

725
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,240
I'll tell the manager for you.

726
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,200
Thank you.

727
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,520
For those who have a crush on someone, but have no courage to confess

728
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,360
because you're fear of rejection.

729
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,160
Don't be fear.

730
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,200
Because there are only two answers.

731
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,720
You'll have to know eventually.

732
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,960
Stop wasting time guessing it,

733
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,720
just go and ask them directly.

734
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,680
Is there any hope for me?

735
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,880
If they love you back, you'll be happy.

736
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,400
But if they don't, move on.

737
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,760
That is life.

738
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,720
(2 months later)

739
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,639
Yes, Sir. For the plans that I have already sent you.

740
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,840
As for the contract, I will send it to you soon via...

741
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,039
Chet.

742
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,000
What's this crazy girl doing here?

743
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,000
I'll have to call you back.

744
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,520
Uh, all right.

745
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,520
Chet, let's have a meal together.

746
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,800
Have a meal?

747
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,760
Oh, I'm good.

748
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,480
Why? I just want to have a chat.

749
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,120
Let's go outing. Anywhere will do.

750
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,600
I see. You guys are chitchatting.

751
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,400
No wonder you haven't called.

752
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,560
I asked Chet to join us.

753
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,240
But he said no.

754
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,200
No? Why not?

755
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,039
Well, I'm busy.

756
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,720
Maybe another time?

757
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,160
Sorry, I'm very busy.

758
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,560
- See you. - Okay.

759
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,120
Wait, Chet.

760
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,880
You can't say no next time.

761
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,160
What would you like to eat?

762
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,120
That blonde girl already knows everything,

763
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,840
I'll be friends with her.

764
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,800
I can't make Nott my man.

765
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,760
I guess I'll be friends with his girl.

766
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,120
Hey, Nott.

767
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,640
So, I think I'll join you after all.

768
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,080
Yeah.

769
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,160
Isn't that the same thing, Man?

770
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,960
- So? - I'll pick them up then.

771
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,560
- Thank you. - All right.

772
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,680
I wonder if he's okay.

773
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,440
- Toon. - What is it?

774
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,719
- You may have to go home by yourself. - What?

775
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,080
I think I found my soulmate.

776
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,720
- I'll be right back. - Hey.

777
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,440
Right, that's your type look like Puerto Rican.

778
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,040
Go for it, Man.

779
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,920
Hello.

780
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,080
Are you with anyone?

781
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,000
If not, you can join me at my table.

782
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,200
Are you hitting on me?

783
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,680
You can say that.

784
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,160
So, if I hit on you,

785
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,360
will there be a place in your heart for me?

786
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,160
Are you sure you want to hit on me?

787
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,040
Of course, I am.

788
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,600
With smoky voice and figure a Victoria Secret model,

789
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,080
you're totally my type.

790
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,800
Are you sure you want to hit on me?

791
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,440
You look familiar.

792
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,000
Beer.

793
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,640
Chet!

794
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,680
Chet.

795
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,640
Oh my god!

796
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,999
I'm going to you.

797
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,480
- Let's go. - Wait, Chet.

798
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,359
Are you Cha-Cha or what?

799
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,920
Whatever, just be my date for one night.

800
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,960
Chet, wait. Toon! Help!

801
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,400
- Help, Toon. - Here I come.

802
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,680
- Toon. - Hi, Kathy.

803
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,720
- Toon, help. - What brings you here?

804
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,280
What the heck, Man?

805
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,280
Come on, let's dance.

806
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,840
Oh.

807
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,160
What are you doing here?

808
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,120
You just startled me.

809
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,440
I got some ideas so I wanted to type it in.

810
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,320
- I was afraid I might forget. - I see.

811
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,640
Where did you came from?

812
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,320
Here. I went shopping for our babies.

813
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,240
You bought so many stuffs.

814
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,840
Here, let me show them to you.

815
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,960
I also got this, look.

816
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,840
Oh, wow.

817
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,720
So? Pretty cool?

818
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,480
Yes.

819
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,760
Do you think it fits him when he's born?

820
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,720
It's too big.

821
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,680
A newborn is so tiny, Thian.

822
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,080
What a pity.

823
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,760
That's okay. I'll keep it for him when growing up.

824
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,840
You know, I also saw dresses for girls.

825
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,200
So cute.

826
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,600
I think, maybe we should have a few girls too.

827
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,680
Oh, Thian.

828
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,880
I'm not a mother pig.

829
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,800
Here, I got a blanket.

830
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,560
You like it? Look, I got so many things.

831
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,800
I got some pants too.

832
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,200
Oh, Moei!

833
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,160
Moei, what's wrong?

834
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,440
I just…

835
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,720
I just got a little dizzy.

836
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,440
Want to see a doctor?

837
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,560
I'm fine.

838
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,760
I guess I was on screen for too long today.

839
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,320
That must be the cause.

840
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,720
I think, lie down for a bit will do.

841
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,840
Are you sure?

842
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,000
Yes.

843
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,680
Come, I'll walk you.

844
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,720
That's okay, Thian.

845
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,200
I can walk by myself. It's not that far.

846
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,680
You can stay here and admire all your purchase.

847
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,920
- Walk slowly. - I will.

848
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,880
Moei! Moei.

849
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,960
Moei.

850
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,440
Moei.

851
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,680
Moei.

852
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,520
Moei.

853
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,360
Moei.

854
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,520
Can you hear me?

855
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,600
Yes, I can hear you.

856
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,200
Am I...

857
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,320
in the hospital?

858
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,080
Yes, we're in the hospital.

859
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,840
Here, let me help you.

860
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,560
Ms. Natheerin, how are you feeling?

861
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,960
I'm feeling better.

862
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,560
But still a little hazy.

863
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,320
Do you have any trouble sleeping?

864
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,759
I sleep fine.

865
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,640
But I get tired very easily.

866
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,520
And I get dizzy a lot.

867
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,800
I see.

868
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:52,200
Let's do this. I'll to run a thorough test on you again, all right?

869
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,200
So we'll know what causes all these symptoms.

870
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,159
- Okay. - All right, excuse me.

871
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,160
Yes.

872
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,400
Thian, did the doctor say when we'll get the results?

873
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,320
Probably tomorrow.

874
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,640
He will call when it's out.

875
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,920
- Thian. - Hmm?

876
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,240
So…

877
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,360
our babies will be okay, right?

878
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,520
Our babies will be fine.

879
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,120
Don't worry too much.

880
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,200
They're surely tough boys.

881
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,480
Moei.

882
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,800
You can't sleep?

883
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,000
No, I don't feel comfortable.

884
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,480
Come here.

885
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,920
Easy.

886
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,480
There.

887
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,680
Come on.

888
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,680
Okay, you can sleep now.

889
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,840
I have a meeting at the site.

890
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,720
I'll be back once it's done.

891
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,040
- Hello? - Hello, Mr. Thiarawat.

892
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,920
I have Ms. Natheerin's results.

893
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,720
I'd like you to take her to see me at the hospital.

894
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,480
Is it bad?

895
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,560
We should talk at the hospital.

896
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,200
Doctor, if possible,

897
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,800
I don't want my wife to know about this yet.

898
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,920
I'm afraid she'll be worried.

899
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:36,520
But I promise you that I'll take care of her

900
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,200
as you instruct me to.

901
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,440
Of course.

902
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,760
What should we make today?

903
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,880
Hmm?

904
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,960
Oh, Dear, did you just kick me?

905
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,760
Right?

906
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,680
Just a moment, okay? Let me see what we have here.

907
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,080
Ms. Natheerin has chronic kidney disease.

908
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,200
This is probably caused by an autoimmune disease,

909
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,520
which I think she has it for some time now.

910
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,879
But we are not yet certain about its cause.

911
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,840
I have consulted with a kidney doctor on her case.

912
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,360
What we can do right now

913
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,840
is to continue with supportive treatment.

914
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,440
So, have we got the results?

915
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,400
Yes.

916
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,119
The doctor called when I was at the site.

917
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,360
Here they are.

918
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,800
- Let me. - So how are the results?

919
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,400
Well…

920
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,320
everything is normal.

921
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,600
That's a relief.

922
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,440
Look, don't get too confident.

923
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,960
You fainted once yesterday.

924
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,200
The doctor said…

925
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,680
it's probably you do too many things.

926
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,120
You should stay still. Don't do things all the time, understand?

927
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,800
I'll die of boredom, Thian.

928
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,200
You won't.

929
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,200
I'll soon be here with you all day and night.

930
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,360
Why? Did you quit your job?

931
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,040
No, not quit.

932
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,680
I'm just taking a vacation.

933
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,280
What?

934
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,399
Hungry?

935
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,240
You have to take these before meals.

936
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,480
What are these pills for?

937
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,560
Well…

938
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,680
they're prenatal vitamins.

939
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,880
Also, the doctor told me

940
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,680
to take you to get an injection tomorrow.

941
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,680
Why does the food look so bland?

942
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,160
The doctor wants you to control diet.

943
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,800
Not too much sodium, fat and sugar.

944
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,240
Let's say, we will need to do a regular examination.

945
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,440
What you have to do for me

946
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:34,440
is to take care of her diet and her lifestyle.

947
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,280
Any strenuous activity must be avoided completely.

948
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,480
- But it's tasteless like water. - Make sure Ms. Natheerin

949
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,440
move as little as possible.

950
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,600
Are you saying my food is not good?

951
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,480
It's good.

952
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,480
But... can I add a little fish sauce?

953
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,680
Moei, you shouldn't eat as you please during this time.

954
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,960
I understand.

955
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,080
Here.

956
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,280
Eat up, okay?

957
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,320
Should I feed you?

958
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,240
I'm good.

959
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,240
Have this, too.

960
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,960
Are you okay?

961
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,080
How are you feeling, Moei?

962
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,440
Any better?

963
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,520
Thian.

964
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,680
Are you tired?

965
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,240
Not at all.

966
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,200
But you must be.

967
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,600
You're carrying two babies inside you.

968
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,680
Thian.

969
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,600
Hmm?

970
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,640
Are you crying?

971
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,080
I'm not.

972
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,840
My eyes just hurt.

973
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,920
Don't lie to me.

974
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,200
You just got touched from what I said, didn't you?

975
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,000
Yeah.

976
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,840
I am so touched.

977
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,480
Moei.

978
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:46,480
You know, I might have been with many women.

979
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,600
Come on, let me finish.

980
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,120
But you...

981
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,960
are the only woman in my heart.

982
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:00,640
And I'm telling you that my heart,

983
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,920
once you're in, you can't get out.

984
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,200
This got me headache.

985
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:14,960
Moei.

986
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,280
Moei.

987
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,640
Moei!

988
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,080
Thian!

989
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,840
Thian!

990
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,560
Moei.

991
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,760
Moei!

992
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,560
Thian!

993
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,320
Moei.

994
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,040
- What's wrong, Moei? - Thian.

995
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,080
Moei.

996
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:53,280
Are our babies gone, Thian?

997
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,600
Thian.

998
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,640
- Moei. - Thian.

999
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,760
Thian! Whoa!

1000
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,880
It's just me, Gig.

1001
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,120
Why did you sleep here?

1002
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,600
I… I must have fallen asleep.

1003
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,720
Don't tell me you slept here all night.

1004
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:16,960
No.

1005
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,800
- Excuse me. - Oh, be careful.

1006
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,360
What's with him?

1007
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,920
Moei.

1008
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,840
What are you doing?

1009
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,520
I'm putting these clothes away.

1010
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,240
It's okay. Just stay still.

1011
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,400
It's okay, Thian.

1012
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,320
I can do this. It's not hard work.

1013
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,280
- You can do what you have to. - It's okay.

1014
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,880
Moei.

1015
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,960
Moei.

1016
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,640
Where are you going?

1017
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,560
I'm going to pick some vegetables.

1018
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,840
I'll do it.

1019
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:51,160
(Baan Suan Romruen)

1020
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,400
Moei, where are you going?

1021
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,080
I'm going to the bathroom.

1022
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,880
Are you going to do it for me too?

1023
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,280
Do you want to use the bathroom?

1024
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,840
No.

1025
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,520
I was just waiting for you.

1026
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,320
Come.

1027
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,800
- You've been acting strange lately. - Hmm?

1028
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,920
Since the day you went to get the results.

1029
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,920
Are you sure there's really nothing wrong with me?

1030
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,520
Hmm?

1031
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,280
Nothing's wrong. You're totally fine.

1032
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,240
Let's sit down.

1033
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,640
Wait.

1034
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,040
There's nothing seriously wrong with me?

1035
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:31,240
Why won't you let me do anything?

1036
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:34,680
I can't just sit back and do nothing, you know?

1037
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,840
Come on, Moei.

1038
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,240
Look.

1039
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,240
It's our first child.

1040
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,480
We have to take the best care of him, right?

1041
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,120
Can you hear Daddy?

1042
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,120
He's kicking.

1043
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:56,920
Really?

1044
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,440
He must've heard you.

1045
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,560
Can you hear Daddy?

1046
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,360
Hey, Thian.

1047
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,240
You're crazier about him than I am.

1048
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,000
Yes, of course.

1049
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,240
You know, if I could get pregnant for you, I would.

1050
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,680
Yeah, right.

1051
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,280
Look here.

1052
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,520
Tada!

1053
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,400
Our bellies are equal now.

1054
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,360
How to walk with this?

1055
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,160
You walk like this.

1056
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:31,320
You have to bend your back a little. It's really heavy.

1057
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,440
Really?

1058
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,520
- Our bellies are the same size. - Let's belly bump.

1059
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,920
Let's sit down. You stand too long now.

1060
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,960
- Okay, I'm getting sore. - Okay.

1061
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,000
- Come on. - Are you all right?

1062
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,320
You need more practice.

1063
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,040
In case you can get pregnant.

1064
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,280
Come on. Easy does it.

1065
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,080
Come on.

1066
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,600
Easy does it.

1067
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,520
All right.

1068
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,040
Oh.

1069
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,120
Come, sit down.

1070
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,280
Hold on.

1071
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,760
Let me brush it for you.

1072
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,440
Slowly.

1073
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,600
Easy does it.

1074
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,440
Oh, my.

1075
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,640
It's not easy to move around.

1076
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,360
Let me see.

1077
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,200
What if we really were having four babies?

1078
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:42,760
Maybe not. Come on, where were you?

1079
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,360
- I'll get on with it. - You should.

1080
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,120
Yes.

1081
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,960
I'll back to work, okay?

1082
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,240
Oh, I forgot.

1083
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,640
- My belly is so big. - Yeah, right.

1084
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,200
So overacting indeed.

1085
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,640
Easy does it.

1086
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:09,120
Moei, I brought some food.

1087
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,480
Gig.

1088
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,400
By the way,

1089
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:17,280
Moei, do you think Thian has been acting weird lately?

1090
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,760
Why? What makes you think so?

1091
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,040
Well, I feel like

1092
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,440
he seems so stressed out these days.

1093
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,960
Is he like that when he's with you?

1094
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,559
He is, right?

1095
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,040
I know, right? He seems so...

1096
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,040
Hello.

1097
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,200
- Here. - What's that?

1098
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,160
I brought you some food.

1099
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,080
- You're gonna love it. - Let me see.

1100
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:57,920
Oh.

1101
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,040
I've been craving that, Gig.

1102
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,880
How did you know?

1103
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,280
Have you forgot that I have the sixth sense?

1104
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,560
That's right. I guess I forgot.

1105
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,120
- Then I'll dig in now. - Go ahead, I made it for you.

1106
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,560
Wait. You can't.

1107
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,800
Uh... you can't eat this.

1108
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,039
- Gig. - Yes?

1109
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,960
I'm sorry. Moei's with child. She should avoid strong flavors.

1110
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,240
Moei.

1111
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,720
How about something else? I'll make it.

1112
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,280
I want to eat mackerel chili paste.

1113
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,800
Let me.

1114
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,520
Let's wait until after you give birth. Be patient, okay?

1115
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,240
- Gig, please put it away. - All right.

1116
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,200
No, I'll eat it.

1117
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,760
Moei, no.

1118
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,279
Moei.

1119
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,160
- Let go. - Oh dear, please don't fight.

1120
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:02,400
Oh, Thian.

1121
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,040
Oh, my.

1122
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,600
Come on, Thian. That's enough.

1123
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,400
Oh, my.

1124
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,480
Moei, wait.

1125
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,080
What else do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.

1126
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,200
I don't want to eat anything.

1127
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:36,240
Do you know how sick I am with your food?

1128
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,040
For the past two weeks, I only had clear soup and boil vegetables.

1129
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:42,400
The same thing all over again.

1130
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:45,439
Only vegetables and everything was so bland.

1131
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,160
I'm so sick of eating those food.

1132
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,200
I just want to eat chill paste.

1133
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,760
But you're pregnant.

1134
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,919
You can't eat spicy food.

1135
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,280
But I really want to eat it.

1136
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,000
Moei.

1137
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,480
Hey, Moei. Moei!

1138
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,560
Gig.

1139
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,200
Doctor wants Moei to control diet.

1140
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,880
If I stop her, she won't listen.

1141
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:09,920
So I'm begging you.

1142
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:13,240
No strong flavors. Spicy, salty, sour, sweet, none of that.

1143
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,160
All right.

1144
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,360
Thank you.

1145
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,840
Moei.

1146
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,800
Moei.

1147
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,240
Moei.

1148
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,480
Are you mad at me because I ate all your food?

1149
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:49,640
Yes.

1150
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,880
- Moei, wait. - Go away.

1151
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,400
I'm sorry, Moei.

1152
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,360
- Moei. I'm sorry. - Go away.

1153
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,920
I got a little carried away.

1154
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,360
Not a little.

1155
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,200
That's a lot. You ate all my food.

1156
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,360
Did you enjoy it?

1157
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,240
Moei, wait.

1158
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,960
- Go away. - I'm sorry.

1159
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,680
Hey, let go.

1160
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,920
I'm sorry.

1161
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,800
I'm sorry.

1162
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,880
Okay?

1163
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:39,240
Moei.

1164
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,440
Please don't sulk.

1165
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,640
Moei.

1166
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,160
Let me see.

1167
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,560
Why are your legs swollen?

1168
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,720
You're right.

1169
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,120
I didn't notice it before.

1170
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,720
Let's check your weight.

1171
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:34,760
- Your weight is over standard. - I didn't eat a lot.

1172
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,400
What's wrong?

1173
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,960
Let's go see the doctor.

1174
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,440
The results are out.

1175
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,960
Ms. Natheerin has high blood pressure.

1176
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:09,120
And there's high level of protein in her urine.

1177
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:12,200
With these two things together,

1178
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:16,520
it means that you have a pre-eclampsia.

1179
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:22,839
Therefore, I would like you to be admitted right away.

1180
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,280
I don't want you to go home.

1181
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:27,120
When you start having a headache, a blurry vision

1182
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,879
and an epigastric rising symptoms.

1183
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,000
You may have a seizure right after,

1184
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:35,160
which will be dangerous to both you and the babies.

1185
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:50,880
Hello, Thian. What's up?

1186
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,960
Why aren't you talking?

1187
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,240
What's wrong? You don't sound good.

1188
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,560
Hey.

1189
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,160
Is it about Moei?

1190
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,600
Mom.

1191
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,280
Can you come to me?

1192
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,320
I can't take it anymore.

1193
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,840
We all meet

1194
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:12,880
only to part.

1195
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,200
I said no!

1196
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:18,120
Didn't you promise me we would build a family together.

1197
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,600
But it's not easy to find a kidney donor.

1198
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,120
Doctor, her blood pressure is rising.

1199
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,120
- Ms. Natheerin is having kidney failure. - What?
