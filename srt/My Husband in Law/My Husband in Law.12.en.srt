1
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,480
If I become yours tonight,

2
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
you won't leave me again.

3
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,200
I'm doing this

4
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,480
because I love you.

5
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,520
I saw with my own eyes that Thian carried Moei to his room.

6
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,999
Natheerin and TecTien are having an affair.

7
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,680
Moei is getting a divorce?

8
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
So they're all here to see her.

9
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,320
Please give this to Moei.

10
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,240
Your butts are really sexy.

11
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,000
Do you think you could plan a divorce without me knowing?

12
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll have to marry you

13
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
before your plan succeeds.

14
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,760
If you want something waiting for you,

15
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,160
it's not hard at all, Moei.

16
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
I think we've been running long enough.

17
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,400
We shouldn't run from anyone.

18
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,400
Come see me after work.

19
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Where?

20
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,200
Hello? Ri.

21
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,240
How come I heard nothing from you all?

22
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm sorry, Mom. I've been busy with work.

23
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,440
Did something happen?

24
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,120
How are Thian and Moei doing?

25
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,480
Well, they are fine.

26
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,040
Mom, I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

27
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,240
I have to go.

28
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,600
Wait, Ri. Ri, hang on.

29
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,040
Hey.

30
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,240
Tell Arthit to summon everyone to the meeting this evening.

31
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,600
Yada is here representing Thada Construction

32
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,880
on behalf of Thada.

33
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,800
From what we see,

34
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,960
she has only been working.

35
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
Maybe

36
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
she has a hidden agenda.

37
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,160
Nott, do you think…

38
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,200
Well,

39
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,400
I've been trying to be alone with you for a while now

40
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,520
so we can talk.

41
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,720
Why? Is there something wrong?

42
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,120
I just feel like

43
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,680
you are…

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,800
acting strange.

45
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,560
I think I know why.

46
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

47
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,400
No, not at all, I understand.

48
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,480
I'm not judging you or anything.

49
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,240
It's just that.

50
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,400
I might not be able to reciprocate your feelings.

51
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,560
I hope we can still be friends.

52
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I don't like men, all right?

53
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,640
And I'm telling you,

54
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,640
Chet doesn't like me, neither. Right, Chet?

55
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,360
Tell them.

56
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
Don't worry, Nott.

57
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,760
I just have good feeling for you.

58
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,080
I don't expect anything.

59
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,560
Of course, we can be friends.

60
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,040
Thank you so much.

61
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,480
Last night,

62
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,000
they disappeared into his room all night.

63
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,600
And in the morning, they crawled out together.

64
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,919
Goodness, what a disgrace.

65
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,640
She has no shame or what?

66
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,439
- Right. - If she can't be faithful,

67
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,240
at least she should have some morals.

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,559
Yeah.

69
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,880
She will only go to hell when dead.

70
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,240
She deserves to get condemned for it.

71
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,880
- That's right. - Absolutely.

72
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,280
I heard the engineers talking about them being siblings.

73
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,640
Incestuous sibling, you mean?

74
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,160
That's why they were kissing on the balcony last night.

75
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,960
- Really? - Wait, how did you know that?

76
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,679
Kaofang followed them

77
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
and she saw everything.

78
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,720
If the executives hear

79
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
that an employee

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,920
is screwing her supervisor...

81
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,360
Oh, I can't imagine.

82
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm sure they won't keep her around.

83
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,360
Hey, are you okay?

84
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,160
- What? - I mean last night.

85
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,440
How much did you drink?

86
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,759
Right.

87
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,760
I'm still hungover. I have a headache.

88
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,880
I shouldn't have drunk that much.

89
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,280
Are you okay?

90
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Come on.

91
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,600
Why wouldn't she be, Tum?

92
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,320
Listen. I have good news for you.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,840
I got hold of the lawyer.

94
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
Remember?

95
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,240
I told you about a lawyer who specialized in divorce.

96
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,800
We can leave that for now, Kang.

97
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,960
Hey, why wait?

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,600
You need to end it now.

99
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,320
Right?

100
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,560
Don't you know she's tried to throw herself at him earlier too?

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,080
My goodness.

102
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,400
This lawyer is the best there is.

103
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,480
You'll definitely win the case.

104
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,560
TecTien is going down for sure.

105
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,040
Kang, let's change the subject.

106
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,080
What? Why change the topic?

107
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,199
Are you afraid he will hear us?

108
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,440
Why should you?

109
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,640
Because right now, we've got the upper hand over him.

110
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,040
It's not about that.

111
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,960
Then what is it about?

112
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,680
Is it already too late?

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,400
- Oh, Moei. - What's too late? What it?

114
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,840
Hmm?

115
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,280
Do you like playing hide and seek?

116
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,720
Let's go back to our room.

117
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,200
Come on.

118
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,520
Wait, what is this?

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,800
Hey, no, Kang.

120
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,840
You stop it right there.

121
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,800
You might treat us to dinner last night

122
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,120
but you have no right to this to Moei.

123
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,400
Let her go right now. Let her go.

124
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,080
Stop it, Kang.

125
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,680
Don't stop me, Tum. I can't put up with this anymore.

126
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,400
Look. Although you and Moei legally are married,

127
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,760
it doesn't mean that you can treat her like she's your property.

128
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,920
Just be prepared as you might go bankrupt.

129
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
What do you mean?

130
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,440
You're so stupid.

131
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,999
Moei is about to file for a divorce.

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
Stop being cocky already.

133
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,120
Who's the stupid one here?

134
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,800
Let's go.

135
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,120
Hey, wait a minute.

136
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,320
Just let them go.

137
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,880
He called me stupid.

138
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,360
Because you are.

139
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,240
- Why are you attacking me? - I'm not.

140
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,320
Kang, listen.

141
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,360
Thian already knew that Moei wanted to file for divorce,

142
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,120
so he took you out to drink.

143
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,000
What do you mean?

144
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
It means you can't sue him anymore.

145
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,080
I don't get a word you say.

146
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,000
They were alone together last night.

147
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,280
They are real husband and wife now, you got it?

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,000
Got it now?

149
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,360
Oh, gosh. Tum!

150
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,200
- Why didn't you tell me sooner? - Keep it down.

151
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,720
How could you let me yell at him like that?

152
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,320
Stop it, calm down, That's enough.

153
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,480
Why did you leave so early?

154
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,200
I told you Pondej's men are everywhere.

155
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,400
You shouldn't go out.

156
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,680
What were you talking to Ri?

157
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,880
Is it about Pondej?

158
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,400
From now on, when I tell you something,

159
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,760
you have to listen to me.

160
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Okay?

161
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,760
Stop resisting.

162
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,520
No, Thian.

163
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,760
What do you want to know?

164
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,200
What's the situation over there?

165
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,000
There's not much going on.

166
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,960
Thian's brother has his men standing guard around camp.

167
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,040
His brother's men?

168
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Yes.

169
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,400
How many?

170
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,880
Not less than five.

171
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,960
Good.

172
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,840
Well, then

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,520
you can keep your eyes on Thian for me.

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,160
We'll only put small posts down over here.

175
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,040
- Umm. - As they're for a small pier.

176
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,680
- Just be careful. - Yes, Sir. As for over there,

177
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,840
we're planning to install big posts.

178
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,520
- I see. - It's because…

179
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,840
Can you get up?

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,680
Please take time reading the report first.

181
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
Give me the report.

182
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,200
Here.

183
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,000
We're here.

184
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,240
I saw that. What are you two doing?

185
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,760
Hey, man. There are people here.

186
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,679
- I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry.

187
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,960
Save that for later.

188
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,120
Hello.

189
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,040
- Hey. - Keep your hands to yourself.

190
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,320
What's up, lover boy?

191
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,640
- Hello. - Please forgive us.

193
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,400
- Hello. - Hello.

194
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Are you okay?

195
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
And this one too.

196
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,520
Tomorrow will be the day

197
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,080
to see if I can get Pondej out of Thian's life for good.

198
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,360
Can you promise that you won't hurt Thian

199
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,560
like we agreed on?

200
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,120
Of course.

201
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,400
Well, then

202
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,920
you can bring him in tomorrow morning.

203
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,640
Got our men ready?

204
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,080
Good, we'll finish him off tomorrow.

205
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,840
Mr. Thian, we will arrive there tomorrow.

206
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,120
Good.

207
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,320
You're so handsome.

208
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,760
Perfect in all aspects.

209
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,600
Except you're a jerk.

210
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,040
How long are you going to nag me?

211
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,560
If you won't stop staring,

212
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,480
I'll have to charge you for damages.

213
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,360
(Sathit)

214
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,280
What is it?

215
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,920
I'm in Dawei now.

216
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,560
Sathit.

217
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,880
Tell me, do you work for me or Thian?

218
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,360
- Well, I... - You what?

219
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,520
Tell me everything right now.

220
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,440
Mom.

221
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,360
Don't look at me like that, you rascal.

222
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,520
- Nuch, go get Ri and Mon. - Yes, Ma'am.

223
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,880
Why didn't you tell me that Pondej followed you here?

224
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,760
- I can take care of him, Mom. - You can, your ass.

225
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,760
If you could, you wouldn't need help from Sathit.

226
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,200
Where is Moei?

227
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,360
Get her here.

228
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,160
She's still sleeping.

229
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,600
Why? She's an early riser.

230
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,080
You worked her too hard, haven't you?

231
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,760
She's here to work, so I have to…

232
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,720
keep her busy.

233
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,040
How do you know she's still asleep?

234
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
Answer me, how do you know she's sleeping?

235
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,080
- Moei and I, we... - Madam Sajee.

236
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Madam Sajee.

237
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,040
They brought their men.

238
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,720
I don't know if they have weapons.

239
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,400
It doesn't look like they're here to talk.

240
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,840
They have some nerve to mess with my son.

241
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,880
Get all our men here.

242
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Yes, Ma'am.

243
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,080
If they dare touch my son again,

244
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,480
I'm going to annihilate their whole family.

245
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,720
- Moei. - Oh, Moei.

246
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,120
- Aunt Jee. - How are you doing, dear?

247
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,680
How have you been, Dear?

248
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,440
- I'm doing great. - Right.

249
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,880
By the way, why won't he leave us alone?

250
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,960
I sent Thian all the way

251
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,920
but he still managed to track him down.

252
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,440
Come on, Mom. That's what thugs do.

253
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,960
You know, his father is even worse.

254
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,080
He runs a lot of underground businesses. He is also a politician.

255
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,400
This is all because of you.

256
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,120
It's all your fault.

257
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,400
You got yourself involved with gangsters.

258
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,240
You're stupid or what?

259
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
Moei, are you sure you're okay?

260
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,480
Hmm? You look a little pale.

261
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,559
It's nothing, I'm fine.

262
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,200
But you're pale.

263
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,640
She's probably nervous.

264
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,200
- You've been grumbling since you arrived. - Thian.

265
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,560
- Moei. - Moei.

266
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,320
- Moei. - No, don't. I'll go with her.

267
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,880
Hey, Thian.

268
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,400
What's wrong with her?

269
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,560
I don't know.

270
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,040
How can you not know?

271
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,160
I really don't know.

272
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,360
These symptoms are familiar.

273
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
Getting nauseous in the morning.

274
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,760
It's like a morning sickness.

275
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,840
Hmm?

276
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,200
It can't be this soon.

277
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,800
Next month maybe.

278
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,920
- What? - Hmm?

279
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,360
What are you saying. Come here.

280
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,280
Who got Moei pregnant?

281
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
Answer me. Who got her pregnant?

282
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,600
Who else? She's with me, so it has to be me.

283
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,000
- What? - Hey, Thian.

284
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,880
Don't joke about this.

285
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,360
I'm serious.

286
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,200
Thian, did you force yourself on her?

287
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,760
Did you force her?

288
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,080
It's my right to do that.

289
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,720
- Your right? - Jeez, Thian.

290
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,880
How could you say it's your right?

291
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,920
You don't love her. You never did.

292
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,280
How could you do that to her?

293
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,719
- Answer me. - Wait, Mom.

294
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,280
If I hadn't done it, she would've called off the wedding.

295
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,360
What did I do wrong? We're legally married.

296
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,400
Hey! Did you force yourself on her so you wouldn't lose money?

297
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,839
You awful man, you evil.

298
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
- I want to pass out. - Thian, why did you do that?

299
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,920
Didn't I warn you?

300
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
What part of we're married don't you understand?

301
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
It's totally natural. Besides…

302
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,120
- Oh, my. - I…

303
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,320
- How could you say that? - Right.

304
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
- Moei. - Oh, Moei.

305
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,000
- Moei, my dear. - Yes?

306
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,320
Are you expecting?

307
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,600
Yes.

308
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,720
I…

309
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,560
I'm expecting…

310
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,800
What?

311
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,639
I'm expecting some food.

312
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm hungry.

313
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,440
What?

314
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,360
- What? - Hungry?

315
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,600
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

316
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,640
- So you're hungry. - That's right.

317
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,880
Please don't worry.

318
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,240
You're just hungry.

319
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,400
Yes, I am.

320
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,520
- She's hungry. - She's just hungry.

321
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,400
Ri, can you get her some water?

322
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Sure.

323
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,160
So, we'll send Moei to see Pondej first.

324
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,560
No.

325
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,040
I won't allow it.

326
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,920
Me neither.

327
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,440
Isn't there another way, Ri?

328
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,560
It has to be me.

329
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,680
Because I arranged this meeting.

330
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,480
Last time when I went to get information from Thada,

331
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,800
I could get out safely.

332
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,560
This time will be just the same.

333
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,800
Don't worry, Mother.

334
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,400
I will go with her.

335
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,400
If you all are going, then I'll go, too.

336
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,720
- No, you can't. - No, you can't.

337
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,520
Why can't I?

338
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,799
Mother.

339
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,880
More people means it'll be harder to keep everyone safe.

340
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,120
We all are going to be all right.

341
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,280
Trust me.

342
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,800
Are you going to have the girls go first?

343
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,960
If not that way, will he take the bait?

344
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,679
If he sees you, he probably kills you on sight.

345
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,320
Want to be the first to get killed?

346
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
Hey.

347
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,800
Mon is right.

348
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,920
I think we should stick to our plan.

349
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,160
Mon and I will go first.

350
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,320
I'll have my men stay close by.

351
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,680
So they can help you in case of an emergency.

352
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,280
Okay.

353
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,360
This way, Madam.

354
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,440
Thank you.

355
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,480
Madam.

356
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,520
Keep this, just in case.

357
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,320
And please be careful with it.

358
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,720
Thank you for your concern.

359
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,160
You know very well I can take care of myself.

360
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
Right, you're a pro.

361
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,000
- I'll be leaving now. - All right.

362
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,520
- Oh, wait. - Yes?

363
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
I know.

364
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,800
Thian and Ri said they could handle this

365
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,760
but I don't trust Pondej.

366
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,440
Get our men to protect all four of them.

367
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,680
- Yes, Ma'am. - Okay.

368
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,240
Moei.

369
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,240
Can you not go?

370
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,080
No, I can't.

371
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,240
I've been waiting for the chance to finish that man off.

372
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,240
I need to go.

373
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,920
They just left.

374
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,080
Thanks.

375
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,000
Your job here is done.

376
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,400
From now on,

377
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,960
it's over between us.

378
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,279
Ms. Yada, will you leave to the airport now?

379
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,320
Yes.

380
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,560
You're here, Moei.

381
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,800
Who are you with this time?

382
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
She's beautiful.

383
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,200
She's my sister-in-law. She keeps me company.

384
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,400
Hello, Pondej.

385
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,760
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

386
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,920
What a shame.

387
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,040
Are you married?

388
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,640
How about we get down to business?

389
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,960
Sure.

390
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,080
Where's Thian?

391
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,120
He's waiting for you at the teahouse.

392
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,640
Then, shall we?

393
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,240
Of course.

394
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
After you.

395
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,200
Wait.

396
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,320
Wait.

397
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,880
Are you sure we've never met before?

398
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,000
You asked me that many times already.

399
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,920
Can't you really recognize me?

400
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,120
It was around last year.

401
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,240
A car was tailing Thian's car.

402
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,360
That car kept tailgating him.

403
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,280
When they reached a deserted road,

404
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,360
Thian's car got knocked into the water.

405
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,680
That driver was too reckless, however.

406
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,800
He thought no one was tailing him.

407
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
So he got off his car to check on his victim.

408
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,199
Boss, someone is here.

409
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,680
That man who nearly succeeded in a murder

410
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,600
then saw a taxi pull over.

411
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,120
He saw a woman

412
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,480
coming out of the taxi.

413
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,480
Damn it, let's go.

414
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,720
- You... - So?

415
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,400
Do you remember me now?

416
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,320
Moei is the witness

417
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,080
to your attempted murder against Thian.

418
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,640
Why isn't he answering?

419
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,280
I have our men secure the area, Mr. Ri.

420
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,440
You two…

421
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,400
I hear you wanted to see my brother.

422
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,520
I'll take you to him.

423
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,080
Move.

424
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,400
Yes, good.

425
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,600
All right.

426
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,440
I'll hang up now.

427
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,720
Mr. Ri.

428
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,400
We have all of Pondej's men captured.

429
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,800
Good.

430
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,920
Thian, your family is a mafia or what?

431
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,440
Then you should know who my father is.

432
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,999
You're a grown man.

433
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,560
Are you still a papa's boy?

434
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,560
Right now, we have information on Pondej's company.

435
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,120
Mon and I will leave now.

436
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,120
Wait.

437
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,800
What information?

438
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,160
It's just information on your company.

439
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,440
We'll leave you two to take it from here.

440
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,600
- You! - Don't even think about it.

441
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,639
Take him back to Thailand to be prosecuted.

442
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,800
Do you think you can take me down easily?

443
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,000
If you agree to my conditions,

444
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,480
I'll send you back without a scratch.

445
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,480
If you don't,

446
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,800
I think you know what happens next.

447
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,560
We now got Pondej in custody, Madam.

448
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,000
Everyone is safe.

449
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,560
Thank you so much for the update, Sathit.

450
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,480
No problem, Ma'am.

451
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,880
You know,

452
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,880
the only reason I still keep you alive

453
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,640
is because Thian asked me to.

454
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,040
You should know

455
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,880
that you're not in a position to make demands

456
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,640
but agree to our terms.

457
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,240
Here.

458
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
Who are you people?

459
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,160
Save your questions.

460
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Don't ever mess with my family again.

461
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,840
Otherwise,

462
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,880
you might find yourself ending up in an accident

463
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,960
similar to what happened to my brother.

464
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,639
What are you doing?

465
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,840
Clearing and grubbing.

466
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,920
I'll get Pondej out of Thian's life for good.

467
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,040
Luckily, today is a holiday.

468
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,080
No one is monitoring the system,

469
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,760
so I managed to hack into it easily.

470
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,240
We now have access to Pondej's company's server.

471
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,640
I've got hold of all important files.

472
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,240
These files will destroy Pondej.

473
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,959
He will have no chance to stand in the society again.

474
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,800
Are you giving them to the police?

475
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,160
No.

476
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,960
He has lots of connections. He may get away again.

477
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,160
What will you do?

478
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,320
I'll send them to his partner companies.

479
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,200
Once they know how they are played,

480
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,160
they'll handle him their ways.

481
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Oh, wow.

482
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,760
He will be charged with attempted murder,

483
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,840
and double-crossed by his own men.

484
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,160
His life is going to be a living hell.

485
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,880
Even if we manage to press charge against him,

486
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,960
he can afford to bail himself out.

487
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,880
It's better to let his own men destroy him.

488
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,880
We have badass wives.

489
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,400
And cute.

490
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,560
- Is everything all right, Mon? - Yes.

491
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,640
Thian, where do you keep your work files?

492
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,560
All right.

493
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,200
Hey, Moei.

494
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,520
Wait, Moei.

495
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,600
Don't go yet.

496
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,680
Where are you going? What are you up to?

497
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,280
I'm not sure

498
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,840
whether they had us tracked

499
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,560
when I hacked into the system.

500
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
We may have changed the IP address,

501
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
but we can't change the serial number.

502
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,600
I made sure this laptop was bought under an individual's name,

503
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,880
not the company.

504
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,720
It will be harder to track.

505
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,799
But if anyone asks you

506
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,120
if you've ever used this laptop,

507
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,840
you must confirm with them

508
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,800
that you have nothing to do with it.

509
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,640
Understand?

510
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,160
Yes, got it.

511
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,600
No, wait.

512
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,400
Where are you going?

513
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,760
Just to be safe, I'll get rid of it.

514
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,120
What? Wait.

515
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,560
What did you say?

516
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,240
I'll destroy it.

517
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,080
But this…

518
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,840
Moei! Wait!

519
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,880
- Moei! - Thian, hey!

520
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,440
- Moei. - Thian, wait.

521
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,080
About Yada snooping around our site,

522
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,760
are you certain

523
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,320
that she didn't use Thada Construction as an excuse

524
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,520
and try to cause more trouble?

525
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,279
I have to go after Moei. She took my laptop saying she would destroy it.

526
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Okay.

527
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,880
Moei!

528
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Moei!

529
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,440
Moei!

530
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,760
Thian!

531
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,080
It's all Pondej's plan to lure you and Natheerin here.

532
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,080
My men are holding Pondej captive.

533
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,040
His plan failed.

534
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
It didn't. It's a trap.

535
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,720
You have to believe me.

536
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,120
Why should I believe you when I don't trust you?

537
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,400
Just stay out of this.

538
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,680
It will all be over soon.

539
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,960
No, it's not over.

540
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,760
Listen to me.

541
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,280
Pondej wants to have you and Natheerin killed.

542
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,559
Has anyone used my laptop?

543
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,479
I think I saw Thian do something with it.

544
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,079
You have to unlock my laptop.

545
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,200
Why would I?

546
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
So you won't unlock my laptop?

547
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,680
No.

548
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,600
Oh.

549
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,920
Follow him!

550
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,360
Kill them.

551
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
Moei!

552
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Moei!

553
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,520
Moei!

554
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,080
Madam, Pondej double-crossed us and got away.

555
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,839
He also took Moei with him.

556
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,880
What?

557
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,400
We're now splitting up to look for her.

558
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,399
For Thian's safety,

559
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,400
should I send him back to the base camp?

560
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,040
No, don't.

561
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,480
But Madam.

562
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,960
Just find Moei and get her back safely.

563
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,800
If this is how he wants to play,

564
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,320
there's no need for us to go easy on him, okay?

565
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,160
Copy that, Madam.

566
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,680
Maybe this is how things should be.

567
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,280
Thian must repay Moei

568
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,040
and save her life.

569
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,840
- Let me go. - Stop resisting.

570
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,400
- Let go! - Hey.

571
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,800
Stay still.

572
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,880
Come back here.

573
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,120
Get over here.

574
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,840
I said stay still!

575
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,280
Don't try to run.

576
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,399
I don't want to blow this genius brain of yours.

577
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,640
Do you understand?

578
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,880
Don't move.

579
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,800
They say you can't judge a book by its cover.

580
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,360
I guess it's true.

581
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,480
Who would've thought that a sweet and naive girl like you

582
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,880
would be this rebellious?

583
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,400
Don't move.

584
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,600
What are you trying to do?

585
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,520
I'm going to destroy you and Thian.

586
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,800
Don't move!

587
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,320
You must really love your husband

588
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,320
to risk your life for him like this.

589
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,320
Look.

590
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,800
You know very well that he's just using you

591
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,119
but you're kind enough

592
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,160
to let him use you as a buffer.

593
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,760
Stay still.

594
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
I'm telling you.

595
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,360
A guy like him

596
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,680
never loves anyone but himself.

597
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Especially not a vendor's daughter like you.

598
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Do you think he really loves you?

599
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,480
Let me go.

600
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,800
So now, he's going to die because of a woman.

601
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,440
Moei!

602
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,320
Moei!

603
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,800
In my initial plan,

604
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,280
he should be the one sitting here.

605
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,760
So he will see

606
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,560
and feel the pain

607
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,520
that I once felt.

608
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,480
How dare you cheating on me?

609
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,200
Who's that?

610
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,400
Who are you?

611
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,160
I'm Yada's husband.

612
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,560
You're having an affair with my wife.

613
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,119
Ri, Mon.

614
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,560
- Thian. - Did you find her?

615
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,920
Calm down, Arthit and Sathit are looking for her.

616
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,320
She's nowhere to be found.

617
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,400
- What do we do now? - Hey, Thian.

618
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,720
Thian.

619
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,480
I could kill you right now

620
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,680
but I think that's too easy.

621
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,360
Since you love him that much,

622
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,960
I'll make you pay for his crime.

623
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Why bother crying? No one can help you here.

624
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
Come here.

625
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,120
Let her go.

626
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,200
Yada.

627
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,440
Get off of her.

628
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,240
Or I'll shoot you.

629
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,280
Fine.

630
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,840
Get out of here, Moei.

631
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,880
Why, Yada?

632
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,600
Why do you keep betraying me?

633
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,880
I'm not betraying you.

634
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,320
I never said I was on your side.

635
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,600
Hey.

636
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,800
How can you be so stupid?

637
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,040
Haven't you learned from your mistake?

638
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,560
Isn't it because of that man

639
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,320
who ruined our lives like this?

640
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,199
Your dad is in jail.

641
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,719
Your family is going bankrupt.

642
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,280
I don't have a country to go back to.

643
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,920
- Isn't it because of those two? - Stop it!

644
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,160
Stop blaming others.

645
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,480
This has always been between us.

646
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,760
What happened was my fault.

647
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,360
I told Thian that I wasn't seeing anyone.

648
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,200
He was trying to end things with me.

649
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,520
But it was me

650
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,880
who wouldn't stop.

651
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,040
If I could choose,

652
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,440
I would never have cheated on you.

653
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,760
I never wanted to cheat on you.

654
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,240
But you did.

655
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,000
You cheated on me!

656
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,520
Why?

657
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,800
Why can't you see my love for you?

658
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,960
Love?

659
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,200
You dare call it love?

660
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,320
If you loved me,

661
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,560
you wouldn't have hurt me.

662
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,520
You wouldn't have abused me

663
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,440
and hurt my feelings like this!

664
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,640
Why did you do this?

665
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,880
Come here!

666
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,040
Come here!

667
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,720
You're such a killjoy.

668
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,960
You troublemaker!

669
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Why do you always have to hurt me?

670
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,800
All the horrible things you did to me,

671
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,640
it keeps reminding me

672
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,760
that you've never loved me.

673
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,120
You've never cared about me at all.

674
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,640
You only see me as your property.

675
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,280
Please stop, Pondej.

676
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,160
Stop hurting other people.

677
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,000
Don't let any women get hurt because of you anymore.

678
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,840
Are you done talking?

679
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,560
Shoot me.

680
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,760
If you hate me, just kill me once and for all.

681
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,720
Don't test me.

682
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,760
Everything between you and me

683
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,640
is over.

684
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,640
- Haven't you found her? - No.

685
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,920
Go search over there.

686
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,640
Come on.

687
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,320
Moei!

688
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,520
Thian.

689
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,080
Moei, watch out!

690
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,240
Grab him.

691
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,640
Let me go.

692
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,280
Thian, no.

693
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,560
Thian.

694
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,480
Please hang in there.

695
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,280
Moei.

696
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,240
Ri, Mon, Thian got shot.

697
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,560
- Get off of me! - Thian!

698
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,760
- Let go off me! - You have to be okay.

699
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,880
Thian.

700
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,440
- You hurt my brother? - Thian.

701
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,280
Please be okay, Thian.

702
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,199
- Thian. - Please hang in there.

703
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,680
Thian. Thian.

704
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,520
- Are you all right, Man? - Thian.

705
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,680
- Thian. - Thian.

706
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,760
Thian.

707
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,440
He is going to be all right, Moei.

708
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,960
Thian.

709
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,280
- Mom. - How is he holding up?

710
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,480
I'm so sorry.

711
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,920
If he hadn't come to help me, he wouldn't have…

712
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,760
It's okay, Dear. Don't cry.

713
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,159
You don't need to say anything.

714
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,960
I'm glad that you're safe.

715
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,680
I am sure Thian will pull through like he did last time.

716
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,400
Don't cry, Dear.

717
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,320
He's safe now, Dear. He's safe.

718
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,400
Don't cry, Moei.

719
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,480
He's all right, Moei.

720
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,200
- You can be happy now, he's safe. - Stop crying.

721
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,000
- I'm so relieved. - Yes, Mother.

722
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,200
Get off of me.

723
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,840
I'm sorry to say this.

724
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,040
My brother is safe.

725
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,720
Are you ready to go to jail?

726
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,960
Someone like me will never go to jail.

727
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,040
Don't you forget.

728
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,560
I have a witness who saw you try to kill Thian.

729
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,680
As for today, I've got plenty of witnesses.

730
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,920
You will be brought to justice, Pondej.

731
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,479
All of you will pay for this.

732
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,920
- Hey. - Let go of me! Let go!

733
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,080
Sathit.

734
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,360
Oh, all right, Sir.

735
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,360
Madam Sajee has a little souvenir for you.

736
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,600
- Madam Sajee? - Yes.

737
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,760
Who the hell is she?

738
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,680
Oh, my.

739
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,960
You don't need to know who she is.

740
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,720
But don't worry. a guy like Mr. Pondej only deserves the best.

741
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,160
It's this.

742
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,040
- It's for you. - What are you doing?

743
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,880
- I'll show you. - No, don't do it.

744
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,920
- No! - You can't stop resisting?

745
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,920
Let me kick you just once.

746
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,160
Take him out of sight, go.

747
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,560
No!

748
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,560
Oh, he's really something.

749
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,280
Do you remember what you did to my brother?

750
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,000
What are you trying to do?

751
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,120
Let me go, you can't hurt me.

752
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,520
Okay, release him.

753
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,520
No.

754
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,239
That's enough. Bring him up.

755
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,040
- Let me go. - Let's go.

756
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,040
You rascal.

757
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,840
If I get out of here,

758
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,280
I'll kill you all one by one.

759
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,160
Look.

760
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,040
I'll give you a chance

761
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,120
to repent.

762
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,760
Come on.

763
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,400
I didn't do anything wrong.

764
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,239
Just keep in mind.

765
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,240
Never mess with my family again.

766
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,240
Leave my boss and her family alone.

767
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,920
If that couple manages to escape,

768
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,960
I'll come back and make you pay for it.

769
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,160
Moei, watch out!

770
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,400
Thian.

771
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,080
Don't ever do this again.

772
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,640
Only I can risk my life for you.

773
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,640
You must not risk your life to save mine.

774
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,200
I don't care what you say.

775
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,600
I love Thian.

776
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,680
I've loved him for a long time. Many more years than you have.

777
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,280
Probably since before you even knew he existed.

778
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,040
So I'll never let you take him away.

779
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,840
Why did you save me?

780
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,440
I did that.

781
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,400
I guess because I wanted to save myself, too.

782
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,320
After all this time,

783
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,800
Pondej might agree to divorce me

784
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,720
but he was never out of my life.

785
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,280
From now on,

786
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,280
I can finally be free.

787
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,799
So let's just say,

788
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,800
it's a win-win for both of us.

789
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,640
Does this mean

790
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,720
we don't owe each other anything anymore?

791
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,680
That's right.

792
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,600
There's no need for me

793
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,960
to hang around in your life and Thian's

794
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,040
anymore.

795
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,480
You and Thian are very lucky to have found each other.

796
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,920
I hope that one day,

797
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,680
I'll find the love like you both have.

798
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,600
Why do you always have to hurt me?

799
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,000
After all the storms I've survived,

800
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,920
I've learned a lot of things.

801
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,360
And one of them is...

802
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,200
on the day I had no one left,

803
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,320
the only one who comforted me

804
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,200
was myself.

805
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,800
And the only thing I can do right now

806
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,480
is to love myself again.

807
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,080
Say goodbye to Thian for me.

808
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,360
Good luck, Moei.

809
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,280
Hey, remember us?

810
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,040
You.

811
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,680
How did you find me?

812
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,080
I heard you were hiding out here.

813
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,320
It's time for you to pay for what you did to us.

814
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,720
Yada.

815
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,800
Help me.

816
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,480
Yada.

817
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,240
I made a mistake.

818
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,120
No, Yada.

819
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,400
Yada, don't leave me.

820
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,520
Pondej probably has enemies everywhere.

821
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,680
Once he's down, they'll all want to get even.

822
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,880
There's no need for us to get our hands dirty.

823
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,440
- Madam. - Oh.

824
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,960
- Madam. - So?

825
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,320
Right now, Arthit is taking Pondej back to Thailand.

826
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,200
Very good. Did you find the taxi Moei was riding that night?

827
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,480
Yes, Ma'am.

828
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,560
And he agreed to testify.

829
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,280
Really? That's great.

830
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,120
His father won't be able to help him this time.

831
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,280
Thank you, Sathit.

832
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,600
Yes, Ma'am.

833
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,000
Let's go.

834
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,560
- Thian. - Thian.

835
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,040
- Thian. - How are you feeling?

836
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,080
- Feeling better? - You're okay now.

837
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,160
Where is Moei?

838
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,200
Is she okay?

839
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,720
Moei.

840
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,360
Moei, come here.

841
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,440
Thian.

842
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,480
I'm all right.

843
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,800
Thian.

844
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,440
I thank you so much

845
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,600
for saving my life.

846
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,880
I'm glad you're safe.

847
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,000
From now on, you must stay close to me.

848
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,760
Don't ever leave my sight.

849
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,600
Do you understand?

850
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,760
Oh, my, my.

851
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,240
Were my eyes playing tricks on me?

852
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,400
No, Mom. I saw the same thing.

853
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,640
It looks like Thian is learning to love someone.

854
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,880
Well, I still can't trust that rascal.

855
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,360
You know how he is.

856
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,800
He put up a real thick wall in his heart.

857
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,560
I don't believe anyone can take it down.

858
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,240
Mom.

859
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,439
You can't forget the fact

860
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,520
that no matter how thick a wall is,

861
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,520
small dust can get through it.

862
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,640
Mom.

863
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,120
If Thian really falls for Moei this time,

864
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,160
what will you say?

865
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,840
What else can I say?

866
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,880
I'll only be happy to have Moei as my daughter-in-law.

867
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,440
But you know your brother very well.

868
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,120
He was never serious about anyone.

869
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,200
You're right.

870
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,240
He was never serious about anyone.

871
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,320
But Moei might be the exception.

872
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,960
Mom.

873
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,520
I know my brother.

874
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,400
He has never taken advantage of women.

875
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,640
What do I do now?

876
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,600
- Nothing at all. - Nothing at all.

877
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,440
Mother.

878
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,440
I don't want those two to be apart.

879
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,080
Me neither.

880
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,839
If he can prove to me that he can take care of Moei,

881
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,960
I might reconsider my decision.

882
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:09,200
This shameless woman won't get away with it this time.

883
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,599
Good morning, Madam Sajee. Your car is not here yet.

884
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,960
- Please wait a moment. - Okay.

885
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,680
This way, please.

886
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,760
- Get me the files to read while waiting. - Yes, Ma'am.

887
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,960
Hey, have you seen the picture of Thian with that woman?

888
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,440
No, what picture? Tell me. I want to know.

889
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,840
Didn't you get the e-mail?

890
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,040
What e-mail?

891
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,440
Come on, it's being forwarded to everyone in the company.

892
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,520
It's obscene, I'm telling you.

893
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,800
But not everyone knows about this yet.

894
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,560
Wait until Monday.

895
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,520
When the executives see the e-mail,

896
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,240
I assure you, she's totally going to get fired.

897
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,800
Won't Thian get punished for this as well?

898
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,360
Don't worry about that. No one can touch him.

899
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,079
His mother holds a lot of shares in the company.

900
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,160
No one would dare fire him.

901
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,680
- Nuch. - Yes?

902
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,280
Pack all of Moei's things in Thian's room and put them in mine.

903
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,600
Yes, Ma'am.

904
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,840
You two, leave us.

905
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,120
I said leave us.

906
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,880
All right.

907
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,560
Moei, you go with my secretary.

908
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,320
Go on.

909
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,839
Where are you taking her?

910
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:53,440
Actually, Moei should've left you last time.

911
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,680
I promised her I would let her study abroad.

912
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,840
But instead, you kept her with you.

913
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,000
This time she insists she really wants to go.

914
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,360
I have to let her go

915
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,000
to show my gratitude for helping you.

916
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,399
But we're together now.

917
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,720
Let me have her back.

918
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,280
It's her decision, not yours.

919
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,760
But I'm her husband.

920
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,240
Let me talk to her.

921
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,840
She can still file you for divorce.

922
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,200
She can't do that anymore.

923
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,480
There are many conditions

924
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,480
for the validity of a marriage.

925
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,760
You may be practically and legally married

926
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:38,320
but if a husband doesn't honor his wife in public

927
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:42,880
or intentionally keeps his marital status from being known,

928
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,240
the wife is allowed to sue for divorce.

929
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,840
In a case like this,

930
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,600
she's very likely to win the case.

931
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,760
This morning,

932
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,760
I overheard people calling Moei a lascivious woman.

933
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,240
They say she's married but still throws herself at you.

934
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,480
It wasn't just a few people.

935
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,800
Everyone was talking about it.

936
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,640
To all fellow TPC employees,

937
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,000
From this picture,

938
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,640
there's no need describe the shameful behavior

939
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,439
of a female employee

940
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,640
who joined our company less than a year ago.

941
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,840
Although she's a new employee,

942
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,640
she has been given an opportunity

943
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,520
to work as the assistant to a high-ranked architect.

944
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,200
But instead of using such opportunity to step up her career,

945
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,360
she behaved in a disgraceful manner

946
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,520
and tried to entice and seduce her supervisor

947
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,840
to be more than a colleague

948
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,440
and engaged in sexual relations with him.

949
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,920
Most importantly,

950
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,000
this female employee is already married.

951
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,319
Yet she was unfaithful to her husband.

952
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,639
- She has strong sexual desire... - Did Thian see this?

953
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,320
without being considerate it might affect her supervisor's reputation.

954
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,840
She also had the support from her fellow Hammoc employees.

955
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,240
Kang.

956
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,200
This is the screenshot of your chat with Kob.

957
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,520
Oh, no. What do we do now?

958
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,680
Should any of you wish to have this employee fired

959
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,119
from her employment at TPC,

960
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,279
you can sign the petition on the bulletin board in the main office.

961
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,200
From Someone Who Saw It All.

962
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,800
What are you going to do about this?

963
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,720
Hey, It's your doing, right?

964
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,160
If you had told me the truth,

965
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,920
I wouldn't have had to do this.

966
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,480
You're so evil, Kaofang.

967
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,400
You used our friendship to hurt my friend.

968
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,040
How could you do this?

969
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,440
I'm just doing the right thing.

970
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,880
The right thing? You call this the right thing?

971
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,720
You don't know the whole story.

972
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,680
I'm warning you, you'll regret this.

973
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,320
I trusted you.

974
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,560
From now on, you're not my friend anymore.

975
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,600
Remember that.

976
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,280
Moei, I'm so sorry.

977
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,600
- I'm so sorry. - Kang.

978
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,160
It was all my fault.

979
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,319
You got humiliated because of me. Moei, I'm sorry.

980
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,440
- I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Please get up.

981
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,080
It's really okay.

982
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,920
We all know what the truth is.

983
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,440
Right, Tum?

984
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,200
Yes, that's right.

985
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,320
Yes.

986
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,240
Once the truth reveals itself, everything will be cleared up.

987
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,520
- Yeah. - Right?

988
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,280
I'm sorry, Moei.

989
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,960
It's okay, Kang.

990
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,880
I'll hug too.

991
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,320
It's probably going to be hard for her to come to work on Monday.

992
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,439
But who knows?

993
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,440
Since she has no shame.

994
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,000
TecTien is nowhere to be found since yesterday.

995
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,840
But I guess he won't get fired.

996
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,000
She won't be so lucky.

997
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,200
The company won't keep her around.

998
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,440
Come on, guys. Come hear this.

999
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,120
- Girls. - What's going on?

1000
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,119
Don't run, calm down.

1001
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,360
I've got big news.

1002
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,400
It's about Thian. It's big news.

1003
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,840
- Really? - You know what?

1004
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,039
The executives already knew about this.

1005
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,999
I hear they are going to hold a disciplinary hearing.

1006
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,040
Yes.

1007
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,280
Here's an announcement.

1008
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:13,120
There is going to be a disciplinary hearing for misconduct

1009
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,600
of which has been a widely spread news,

1010
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,439
and consequently affected the image of our organization.

1011
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:22,560
The executive board, therefore, has agreed to form a panel

1012
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,800
to look into the matter.

1013
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,320
I think this is the right thing to do.

1014
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,320
They should fire her, so no one will dare to do it again.

1015
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,959
You know, they put up a huge announcement on the bulletin board.

1016
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,200
They will send out an e-mail to inform all employees later.

1017
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,160
And right now,

1018
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,320
that woman has already been transferred.

1019
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,200
This is going to be huge.

1020
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,800
What position again?

1021
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,560
Thian's assistant.

1022
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,760
When should I start?

1023
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,040
Tomorrow morning.

1024
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,160
All right.

1025
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:05,160
I guess that Natheerin must have been fired.

1026
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,480
I will never get involved

1027
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,600
with an immoral man like that.

1028
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,960
Just wait and see.

1029
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,240
You'll only get to look at me,

1030
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,840
but you'll never get to have me.

1031
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,600
Hey, Kaofang.

1032
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,960
What brings you here?

1033
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,880
I see.

1034
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,240
Thian, is it Kaofang who's filling in for Moei temporarily?

1035
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,000
- Yes. - I see.

1036
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,720
- Good luck. - Thanks.

1037
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,680
Temporarily?

1038
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,240
Hello, Kaofang.

1039
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,320
What is she still doing here?

1040
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,720
Hello, Moei.

1041
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:19,360
Please help guide me on the job.

1042
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,480
Thian, Moei, It's time.

1043
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,960
Okay.

1044
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,720
Moei.

1045
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,920
Excuse me, Beer.

1046
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,520
Where are TecTien and Moei going?

1047
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,360
They're meeting the disciplinary board.

1048
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,520
Oh.

1049
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,960
Hey.

1050
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,080
Beer.

1051
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,880
What's up?

1052
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,840
Do you think Moei will be fired?

1053
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,160
Come on, don't be crazy.

1054
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,160
What did she do wrong? Why would she get fired?

1055
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,960
Besides, she's an IT genius.

1056
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,840
The company would surely keep a competent one like her.

1057
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,440
- Right. - Do you remember

1058
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,760
when we got hacked?

1059
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,320
It was Moei who tracked down the person who did it.

1060
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,040
She caught the hacker.

1061
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,240
You're right.

1062
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,320
Has she found the person who sent out the letter?

1063
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,880
- Keep your voice down. Keep this between us. - No problem.

1064
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:26,999
Yesterday,

1065
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,600
I saw Moei tell Chet

1066
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,960
she wanted to keep this person close by

1067
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,440
to prevent more trouble.

1068
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,600
Is that person here?

1069
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,640
Keep it down.

1070
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,520
People might hear you.

1071
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,000
Why bother finding the informer?

1072
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,240
You can't forget

1073
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,920
the damage has been done.

1074
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:49,560
Natheerin is already married.

1075
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:53,200
She shouldn't have gotten involved with Thian.

1076
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,679
- It's good that you said that, Kaofang. - Right.

1077
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,760
Sure.

1078
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,319
You've worked with Moei on several occasions, right?

1079
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,919
- Yes. - Can you take a look at this for me?

1080
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,880
- You see this? - Yes.

1081
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,720
Do you see any similarities?

1082
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,280
I guess you don't see it.

1083
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,200
Then you'll have to wait until the afternoon.

1084
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,519
- It's already too late now. - Okay.

1085
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,880
Because we need to wait for the board's signature.

1086
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,600
Okay.

1087
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,960
- Guys. - Hmm?

1088
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:26,359
They put up an announcement.

1089
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,639
- Really? - Yes, they did.

1090
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,480
- Why so soon? - I know.

1091
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,280
- Hey. - Where are you going?

1092
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,400
Kaofang.

1093
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,440
Excuse me.

1094
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,000
Excuse me.

1095
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,200
"Announcement

1096
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,040
from Thai Pacific Development

1097
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,000
regarding the investigation result of an anonymous letter

1098
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,280
complaining about an employee's misconduct.

1099
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,480
We would like to inform you

1100
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,240
that Thiarawat Navanavakul

1101
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:01,080
and Natheerin Navanavakul

1102
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,800
have legally registered their marriage."

1103
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,880
What?

1104
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,560
What?

1105
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:08,079
Hey, why did you stop?

1106
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,520
Keep reading, Kaofang.

1107
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,120
- If you can't lead… - "Read".

1108
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,640
Let me read it for you.

1109
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,160
"Thiarawat Navanavakul and Natheerin Navanavakul

1110
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,600
have legally registered their marriage.

1111
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,600
They had a private engagement and a wedding ceremony

1112
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,960
on March 29, 2019

1113
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:35,280
and are still married by law.

1114
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:39,400
Their official wedding will take place in September

1115
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,200
of this year."

1116
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,520
September?

1117
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,559
Kaofang, calm down.

1118
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,199
Tell me this is not true.

1119
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,920
It's so true.

1120
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,360
- Don't pass out yet. - It also says at the end,

1121
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,720
"Please be informed accordingly.

1122
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:58,880
Baramee Taymeewisut, Member of the Board of Directors."

1123
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,600
Goodness. Baramee signed on it himself.

1124
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,000
This can't be a fake.

1125
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,040
Do you see any similarities?

1126
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,999
You don't know the whole story.

1127
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,040
I'm warning you, you'll regret this.

1128
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,960
Now, you can pass out.

1129
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,880
Hey, Kaofang.

1130
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,480
Kaofang.

1131
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,760
It serves you right.

1132
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,399
I told you the truth would reveal itself.

1133
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,560
Believe me now?

1134
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,160
Come on, let's get her up.

1135
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,280
I tried to warn you, Kaofang.

1136
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,840
- Good job, guys. - Well done.

1137
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,160
I just want to know how you ended up marrying him.

1138
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,760
Where did you find him?

1139
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,360
Was it a lucky draw?

1140
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:50,480
Was he a premium you got while grocery shopping?

1141
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,760
It's not that. It's just

1142
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,480
that we are neighbors.

1143
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,120
What made you decide to marry him?

1144
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,960
I didn't get to decide.

1145
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,640
It was an arranged marriage.

1146
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,960
Is it tiring being married to him?

1147
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,280
Yes.

1148
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,560
I'm sorry, Moei.

1149
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,920
If I had taken care of it from the start,

1150
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,400
this wouldn't have happened.

1151
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,880
It's okay.

1152
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,680
It's already over.

1153
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,000
Anyway, have you recovered enough

1154
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,840
to be out of the hospital?

1155
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,320
I wanted to clear up the rumor as soon as I could.

1156
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:58,880
I also…

1157
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,440
wanted to see you.

1158
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,640
I've missed you so much.

1159
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,160
Mom simply took you from me.

1160
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,120
Come back and live with me.

1161
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,120
Moei.

1162
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,760
Ri just told me

1163
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,320
that you wanted to go see Pondej

1164
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,840
because you saw what happened that night

1165
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,600
and agreed to testify.

1166
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,360
Thank you so much

1167
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,800
for calling the rescue team for me.

1168
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,840
It's okay.

1169
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,720
Would you like a reward?

1170
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,760
Can I ask for anything?

1171
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,200
You deserve it.

1172
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,280
Hey.

1173
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:11,800
Once we get married,

1174
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,560
let's go on a honeymoon.

1175
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
No matter where on the earth you want to go,

1176
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,800
I'll take you.

1177
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,240
Anywhere at all?

1178
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,480
I don't think I can go with you, Thian.

1179
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,400
Haven't Aunt Jee told you

1180
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,360
that I'm going abroad to study.

1181
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,680
What about us?

1182
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,280
Don't worry about that.

1183
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,960
I've already told Aunt Jee

1184
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,480
that I don't want you to pay me anything.

1185
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,160
I've never wanted anything from you.

1186
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:03,760
If you really want to give me something,

1187
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:08,640
I'd like your signature

1188
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,120
on our divorce papers.

1189
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,080
- No, we are... - No.

1190
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,960
We're not ready to get married.

1191
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,920
We should at least learn more about each other.

1192
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,840
We'll only fight if we get married now.

1193
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,280
We know each other enough.

1194
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,760
How much more do we need to know?

1195
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,920
Are you sure about that?

1196
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,360
How about...

1197
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,520
we play a game now?

1198
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,840
It's a simple questions game.

1199
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:53,640
If you can answer me correctly,

1200
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,440
we'll get married as planned.

1201
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,920
Deal?

1202
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,160
Listen to my questions carefully.

1203
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,480
When is my birthday?

1204
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,840
Which month?

1205
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,200
What's my favorite color?

1206
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,960
What's my favorite flower?

1207
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,040
What is it,

1208
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,080
the food I like?

1209
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,640
Can you answer even one of them?

1210
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,800
You were born on the first day…

1211
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,640
of October.

1212
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,680
Your favorite color is navy blue.

1213
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,920
You can eat anything

1214
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,480
but not too spicy.

1215
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,000
You like to play guitar

1216
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,680
when you need to clear your head.

1217
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,600
You like listening to music

1218
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,960
but you don't like singing.

1219
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,320
You majored in architecture.

1220
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,120
But sometimes,

1221
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,680
you like landscape design

1222
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,800
and urban architecture.

1223
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,200
You want to have a perfect woman

1224
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,640
as your wife.

1225
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,520
You're married with me

1226
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,920
but you're still waiting for that person

1227
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,120
because I'm not the one you want to marry.

1228
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,840
Did I get anything wrong?

1229
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,400
Don't be so mean to me.

1230
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,600
What about you?

1231
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,520
You didn't want to pay me 10 million.

1232
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,200
So you got me drunk.

1233
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,560
Now,

1234
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,120
who's the mean one?

1235
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,160
Guys, come here, come.

1236
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,320
Come on.

1237
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,120
Let's discuss, come on.

1238
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,960
Come here.

1239
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,080
I think something is off.

1240
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,640
Yeah, now that everyone knows the truth.

1241
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,200
They should be happy.

1242
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,120
How come they seem so sad?

1243
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,920
I think something is going on.

1244
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,040
Well, then.

1245
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,840
- Let's find out. -Yeah.

1246
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,040
Who should do it?

1247
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,040
- Me again? - Yes.

1248
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,200
Why me again?

1249
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,480
Just do it.

1250
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,640
Moei.

1251
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,760
Have you done anything to upset Thian?

1252
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,040
It's nothing.

1253
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,880
I just…

1254
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,280
I called off the wedding.

1255
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,480
I'm going to study abroad.

1256
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,600
- What? - What?

1257
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,840
- You called off the wedding? - To study abroad?

1258
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,360
What? Why?

1259
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,759
Thian, you bullied her again, didn't you?

1260
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,640
You know that if you hurt her...

1261
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,000
Oh, wait, Beer.

1262
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,600
- You shouldn't have, Man. - No, Man. Not now.

1263
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,800
I'm about to submit my request for leave.

1264
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,760
Come on, check it.

1265
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,760
Dear Ms. Natheerin,

1266
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:40,079
Your request for leave cannot be approved.

1267
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,840
As we are currently working on a project,

1268
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,440
employees are not allowed to take leave during this time

1269
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,960
without any sufficient reason

1270
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,760
as it may cause delays to the project.

1271
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,120
You can resubmit your request for leave

1272
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,200
in two months.

1273
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:00,920
If you have any further questions,

1274
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,400
you can come talk to me personally.

1275
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,640
Best regards,

1276
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,880
- Hey. - What?

1277
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,080
Line message. Check Line message.

1278
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,560
The mind game has just started.

1279
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,760
Let's see who will leave and who will stay.

1280
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,840
Thian will never let Moei go anywhere, trust me.

1281
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,680
500 baht says Thian wins.

1282
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:37,920
The wedding will happen.

1283
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,040
Moei is not his equal.

1284
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,160
(Shush!)

1285
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,720
She's tiny but mighty.

1286
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,879
Haven't you heard that all men

1287
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,160
are whipped by their wives?

1288
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,880
If Moei insists hard,

1289
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:56,440
I think he will eventually have to let her.

1290
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,400
Otherwise, all hell will break loose.

1291
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,960
By the way, who will be the dealer?

1292
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,600
Should we put in 500 or 1,000?

1293
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,999
How long will you keep gossiping?

1294
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,200
If work is too light, I should give you more.

1295
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,160
Thian.

1296
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,400
Can I talk to you?

1297
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,080
I still have to prepare the documents.

1298
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:08,680
Who said you could go?

1299
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,640
Aunt Jee did.

1300
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,160
I need to resign quickly

1301
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,480
because I have documents to prepare.

1302
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,200
The semester is starting soon.

1303
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,840
You need to give two-month notice before you can quit.

1304
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:24,960
Don't you know that?

1305
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,920
- But I need to... - I said no!

1306
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,480
Do you want to leave me that badly?

1307
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,080
Have you forgotten

1308
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,520
why we got married?

1309
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,800
Right now,

1310
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,680
Pondej is no longer causing you trouble.

1311
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,440
We should get a divorce.

1312
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,759
What about me saving her life?

1313
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,880
- How didn't I take care good care of her? - Shut up.

1314
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,360
What you did was nothing compared to what she did for you.

1315
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,280
She jumped into the water to save you.

1316
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,280
What is it that ties you up

1317
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:23,080
and keeps you from falling for anyone else

1318
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,320
but Thian?

1319
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,480
I am sorry, Moei.

1320
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,080
Where is Thian?
