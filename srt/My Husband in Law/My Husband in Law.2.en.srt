1
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,360
Push it!

2
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,599
So next time, if you ever mess with my wife again,

3
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,640
I won't keep you alive.

4
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,519
You'll get married to Moei.

5
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,600
Are you crazy, Mom?

6
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
I won't get married to Moei.

7
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,360
Sign it.

8
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,320
He's becoming my husband.

9
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,759
I'll sleep on the floor.

10
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,959
I normally sleep alone.

11
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm not used to having someone else on my bed.

12
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,040
So I'm just someone else to him.

13
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,519
Oh! Thian!

14
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
- Are you hurt? - No.

15
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,640
Aunt Jee said we're now married.

16
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,320
- So we should stay in the same... - Go to your room.

17
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,999
Why do we have to cram in one room?

18
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,119
This is Bangkok, not Phuket.

19
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,480
Snow!

20
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,520
Happiness when loving someone

21
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,520
is to secretly see their good sides.

22
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,599
Hey, eat up.

23
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,559
I can go to work.

24
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,200
If you don't eat, your owner will scold me again.

25
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,760
Gosh!

26
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Snow!

27
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,959
Snow! Hey, Oyua. Oyua!

28
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,080
Oyua, this isn't your food.

29
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,640
Stop it, Oyua.

30
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,439
Oyua. Oyua.

31
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,800
Oyua!

32
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,279
I said stop, Oyua!

33
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
Oyua!

34
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,360
Oyua!

35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
You bad boy!

36
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,640
Oyua!

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,880
Snow!

38
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,040
Oyua!

39
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Gosh!

40
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,080
Why are you so naughty?

41
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,120
Oh, no.

42
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,239
Stay still.

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,600
Go away.

44
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,480
A little closer, dear.

45
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,880
Just get closer, dear. He won't bite.

46
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,960
One, two, three, smile.

47
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,239
Oh, Thian.

48
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,839
You said you would take a half-hour nap.

49
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,119
This pair.

50
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,080
It was too loud. I couldn't sleep.

51
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,560
So, are you off to work now?

52
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,599
Can you wait for me? I'll come with you.

53
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm almost done.

54
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,640
Just a second. Let me put these away.

55
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,079
Wait for me, all right?

56
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,800
Your company is still running?

57
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,199
Thian, you said that again.

58
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,920
You keep saying that every day. Thian!

59
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,880
What? You're leaving without me again.

60
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,719
There's a problem here.

61
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,560
The problem is right here.

62
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,240
It may be difficult for you to understand.

63
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,880
Feng shui is a high-level science and art.

64
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,439
That's why I need you to make so many changes.

65
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:04,360
Besides, I've already calculated the Chinese zodiac sign of Mr. Songphob.

66
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Excuse me.

67
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,639
I understand you, Master and Mr. Songphob. But…

68
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,679
we've done over 70% of the construction based on this design.

69
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,199
It's only 70%, not yet 100%.

70
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,079
We can still fix it.

71
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,320
We can still fix it.

72
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,880
When will Thian be here?

73
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,000
Instead of having the exit here,

74
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,639
we need to dig a canal.

75
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,039
Dig a canal?

76
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,679
To draw in the water dragon's power

77
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,559
for good luck.

78
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,480
But that's the emergency exit.

79
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,600
Someone's in trouble.

80
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,760
If you really want to dig a canal,

81
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,039
we may need to adjust the budget.

82
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,760
The least amount will be…

83
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,760
100 million baht.

84
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,000
He wants a canal so people can jump in for fun?

85
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,240
They will never agree to that. Their budget is tight.

86
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,759
They're stingy ones.

87
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,759
If that's the case, then move the exit.

88
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
We can't.

89
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,559
One emergency exit is needed every 60 meters, as Building Control Act.

90
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,680
Less than that, people can't evacuate within 30 minutes.

91
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,119
It was once on the front page.

92
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,440
Over 100 people died because of an issue with emergency exits.

93
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,240
How about this then?

94
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,200
Make a small pool here.

95
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,560
Hang on.

96
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,039
I think there's something not right with the building.

97
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,559
With a dome at the top like this,

98
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,399
they call it the Roman style.

99
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,159
It's the western style.

100
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,240
We need a large lawn to match the grand scale of the building.

101
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,359
In Chinese we call it "Ming Tang", the mouth of Chi. Do you know?

102
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,520
You talk too much when you don't know things.

103
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,039
I have a very easy solution for this.

104
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,159
That is to completely remove the dome at the top.

105
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,400
What?

106
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,199
- Remove the dome? - Remove the dome?

107
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,319
That's right.

108
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,399
The dome you see there

109
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,559
is what they call a smoke reservoir,

110
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,760
which is connected to the hall.

111
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,040
It collects and contains the smoke when there's a fire.

112
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,600
It helps delay the spread and exhausts the smoke from building.

113
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,639
Smoke always rises.

114
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,800
Even when the fire isn't spread to every floor,

115
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,320
people can die due to smoke inhalation or suffocation,

116
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
not burning.

117
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,760
You told my friends that you want to remove the emergency exit wall parts.

118
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,399
We actually need those walls

119
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,360
to contain the fire for at least an hour

120
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,640
while there's an evacuation.

121
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,240
The taller the building, the stricter we have to be with the design.

122
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,280
If you wish to change anything, I suggest do it on the exterior.

123
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,400
If no one has anything else to say,

124
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,040
I'll assume you all agree with me,

125
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,400
What more can I say after everything you said?

126
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,280
Hey, they just don't know TecTien too well.

127
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,000
What do you mean by Hammoc is being closed down?

128
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,599
Right, Chad. What's going on?

129
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,479
Our company has clients continuously.

130
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,279
How are we not making money?

131
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,720
- That's right. - Yes, that's true.

132
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,120
Stop!

133
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,080
How can I understand if you all talk at once?

134
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,439
It's true that we have clients all year,

135
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,199
but the overall performance has not met the goal they set.

136
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,640
So they're going to close down Hammoc

137
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,200
and merge it with TPC. That's all.

138
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,800
We're merging with TPC?

139
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,360
I don't get it why we didn't meet the goal.

140
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,680
The company bidding the skyscraper project against me is TPC.

141
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm told they have never lost a bid.

142
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,360
But this time they will.

143
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,600
What makes you so sure?

144
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
One of the board members who decides

145
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,000
which company wins the project

146
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,040
is my father's acquaintance.

147
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,440
And he happens to owe my father something.

148
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,240
Do you feel more at ease now, Father?

149
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Okay.

150
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,400
- You're married Thian! - Keep your voice down.

151
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,920
Keep it down!

152
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,799
I can't believe you are really married to him.

153
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,920
So, how did that happen?

154
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,240
The short version, okay?

155
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,919
The long version comes later.

156
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,200
Thian and I are married so that I can be a buffer.

157
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,159
- A buffer? - Yes.

158
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,240
But you can tell no one, all right?

159
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,519
This stays here.

160
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,839
He will kill me if this spreads out.

161
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,720
But why keep it a secret?

162
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,200
I don't get it why hiding this?

163
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,439
Are you his mistress?

164
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,239
No, mistresses don't get the marriage certificate.

165
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,560
I've got one, you know.

166
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,519
You've got the marriage certificate,

167
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,279
but you have to keep it a secret.

168
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,239
That's so lame. I don't get it.

169
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,799
- This is no respect, I hate it. - Come on, stop.

170
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,040
The fact that I get to be married to him and be with him,

171
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,719
it's already like winning a lottery for me.

172
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,200
Did you do it yet?

173
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,599
No.

174
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,239
What about smooching?

175
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
Any making out?

176
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,640
Yes, we did.

177
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,320
He kissed you?

178
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,999
Really?

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,799
Just kidding. We only kissed in my dream.

180
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,439
- In your dream? - Yeah.

181
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,800
That doesn't count.

182
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,719
You can't count dream kisses.

183
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,240
Hey. By the way,

184
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,720
have you told him that we're going to work at TPC?

185
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,200
No, not yet.

186
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,160
So, when is he gonna be home?

187
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,119
And how am I going to tell him?

188
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,399
Gosh! This is driving me crazy.

189
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,680
Tell me what?

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Thian.

191
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Hmm?

192
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,840
Tell me what?

193
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,400
You have to tell him.

194
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,760
Imagine, if he sees us working at TPC,

195
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,000
it's going to be a living hell for you for sure.

196
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Uh...

197
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm making only salmon steak today.

198
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,720
Is that it?

199
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Salmon?

200
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,040
Yes.

201
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,799
That's what I want to eat now.

202
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Uh, Thian.

203
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,360
Why didn't I just tell him?

204
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,080
I'll pour it for you.

205
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,920
Hey.

206
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,400
The ring. Don't let me see you wearing it again.

207
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Got it?

208
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,920
- Thian, I… - Hold it.

209
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,719
Yes? I'll check it.

210
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,920
Wait, Thian.

211
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,960
Sure.

212
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
You said I'd get this project.

213
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,720
Why did TCP get it again?

214
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,760
Now I've lost millions.

215
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,680
I put so much money into it because I trust you.

216
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,360
What do I get now?

217
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,360
Just a blank piece of paper!

218
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,959
Transfer the money to my bank account as we agreed.

219
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,080
I am not paying!

220
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,080
You failed to do your part.

221
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,079
You have the nerve to ask for your cut?

222
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,480
I don't like it when someone yells at me.

223
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,680
And when I get angry,

224
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,440
I don't always know

225
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,960
what I will do.

226
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,960
I'll see you around.

227
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,960
I heard you didn't win the high-rise construction project.

228
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm not in the mood to fight with you.

229
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,360
I'm not here to pick a fight.

230
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,640
I'm just here to finish our conversation.

231
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,640
You remember what I proposed, don't you?

232
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,679
"Thiarawat Navanavakul, a hot young architect at TPC,

233
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,599
is partly behind the success of TPC and makes the stock price go up."

234
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,239
Are you mock me? Don't you know this company took the project from us?

235
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,279
I know, Dad, and I'm not here to mock you.

236
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,319
You might not be interested in Thian right now, but if you…

237
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,880
What do you want?

238
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,280
Just say it.

239
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,519
I found out that one of the shareholders of TPC is selling his shares.

240
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,239
I've already called and agreed on a price.

241
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,919
All you have to do is say yes,

242
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,520
and you'll become one of TPC's shareholders immediately.

243
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,360
A company with billions of share capital in holdings like this,

244
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,880
I think it's quite interesting.

245
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,159
Oyua, stop!

246
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,040
Oyua, stop right now!

247
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,679
- Oyua! - Snow!

248
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,200
Oyua, move! Move now!

249
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,320
You, come here.

250
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,440
- Oyua. - Hey.

251
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,839
- Don't come near. - Oyua.

252
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,480
- Oyua. - Oyua, get out.

253
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,920
- Wow. - Thian!

254
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,960
Thian's house is so comfortably big.

255
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
- Thian! - Why the hell are they here?

256
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,840
We nearly made a lap around your house.

257
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,879
- What's the matter? - Don't show yourself.

258
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,200
- Who? - Hide in your room.

259
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,960
- Why? - I don't want to answer their questions.

260
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,720
Go.

261
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,079
We nearly got lost in the garden.

262
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,320
Wow.

263
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,200
- Why didn't call you're coming? - Why would we?

264
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,040
- Wow, the view is amazing. - Nice.

265
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,479
Why is your house so messy?

266
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,720
Are you hiding something?

267
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,040
Why is your hair so messy? What were you doing?

268
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,600
What could I be hiding? Nothing.

269
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,840
Could it be last night you were…

270
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,640
- Thian, no, please. - Are you doing yoga?

271
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,199
- You never tidy up, do you? - Right.

272
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,959
- Must be aggressive last night. - Everyone else's neat.

273
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,360
- Yeah. - He's nothing like others.

274
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,799
- I see. - Wow.

275
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,360
The breeze is so nice outside.

276
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,400
- All the colors match so nicely. - Yes.

277
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,800
We should come hang out here often. It's so relaxing.

278
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,119
- We should come back. - I'll come back here again.

279
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,439
- Now we have a place to hang out every day. - Yeah.

280
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,479
How about we eat out front?

281
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,439
Yes, out front.

282
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,320
- Both areas are fine. - It's fine by me. This is our house now!

283
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,240
- Get your head inside… - I'll prepare this for you.

284
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
All right, good.

285
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:30,879
Something is wrong here. You usually order us around.

286
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,999
- Yeah, he's right. - Do you need my help?

287
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,440
- No. - Huh?

288
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,960
- He's really weird today. - He wants something from us?

289
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,760
I won't give you a raise, okay?

290
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
- He's the one who gives us a raise. - Oh, right.

291
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,920
- Wait. - What is it?

292
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,839
- Beer, you brat! - Beer!

293
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,120
It must be the spicy chicken feet salad from your alley.

294
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,920
Oh.

295
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,520
- What's wrong? - Where's the bathroom?

296
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,479
Behind a kitchen on the right.

297
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,680
I need to take a poop.

298
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,359
Something is wrong. Oh.

299
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,159
Stop, stop right there.

300
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,920
Hey, can I use your bathroom?

301
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,679
- Behind a kitchen on the left. Go ahead. - Thanks.

302
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
- Thanks. - Go now.

303
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,960
- Go quickly. - I'll be right back with a new song.

304
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,200
Whoa! What the heck, man?

305
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,279
What the hell?

306
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,199
- On the left. - Beer! Beer! Wait, hold it!

307
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,279
Why heading to my room? There's one out here.

308
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,239
- Come here. - Toon, Toon is in there.

309
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,680
You just have to wait a bit.

310
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,640
- Toon, are you done? - No, not for a while.

311
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,879
It's gonna be long. I can't wait.

312
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,760
- Hey, wait. - Oh, man.

313
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
You can't use that bathroom.

314
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,039
Why are you stingy with your bathroom?

315
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,879
Can you not be right now?

316
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,679
- I can't hold it anymore. I need to go. - No, Beer.

317
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,760
- I don't like it when people use my private bathroom. - Oh yeah?

318
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,759
Gosh, why are you being so fussy right now? Read my lips.

319
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,119
I'm about to shit my pants.

320
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,320
- Let go! - Beer!

321
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm here. I'm with Beer.

322
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,640
We need to use the bathroom.

323
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,400
What's wrong with you? Who are you talking to?

324
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,719
I'm about to shit my pants.

325
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,480
I'm telling the house spirits that you are going in to poop.

326
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,519
House spirits, may I take a shit, please?

327
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,640
I can't hold it anymore.

328
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,200
The house spirits just said yes. Thank you so much!

329
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,440
- What is this? - Hey!

330
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,519
It's my mom's. She dropped it.

331
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,840
Doesn't she have short hair?

332
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,080
- Yes. - Okay, that's her business.

333
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,920
Hey, Beer. No!

334
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,519
What the hell is wrong with you, Thian?

335
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,839
If you don't open up, I'll count to three, and I'll take a shit out here.

336
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,120
One, two, three.

337
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,159
Hey, wait, Beer. You can't take a shit here.

338
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,799
- What is wrong with you? - You like my wall?

339
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,480
- I chose it myself. - Get out, my shit is coming out.

340
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,439
You go ahead. I already cleaned it up.

341
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,640
Yeah. Thanks, man.

342
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,160
How can I take a shit with you standing there?

343
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,959
- Get out! - Well, uh...

344
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,599
The sun is too bright, right?

345
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,799
- I'll block it for you. - Why are you being nice now?

346
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,199
I took countless shits in my life. No one covers it.

347
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,639
- Get out! - You sure?

348
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,400
I'm going to take a shit now.

349
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,039
Okay, I'm getting out.

350
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,839
I hold it way too long. Could you please get out freaking now?

351
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Get out!

352
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,439
- How about some music? - Huh?

353
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,399
- Some music? - Do I have to?

354
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,200
Give it back to me later, okay?

355
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,760
I'll put it here.

356
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,079
Can I take a shit in peace?

357
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,639
- I'm going. - Please go, I'm begging you.

358
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,000
Am I going to get constipated?

359
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,480
Take care of yourself.

360
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,160
Okay, second round.

361
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh, man.

362
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,359
It's about time you got out.

363
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,679
You guys left me sitting there all alone.

364
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,800
How could you?

365
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,760
Your toilet is going to burst!

366
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,080
Oh, there's more.

367
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,640
Who is this girl?

368
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
She's my sister.

369
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,560
Hello.

370
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Hello.

371
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,160
Your sister?

372
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,679
Yes, my sister.

373
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,199
Thian, I didn't know you had a sister.

374
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,040
- You never asked. - But why did your sister

375
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,919
have to hide in the bathroom?

376
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,599
- Right. - Well…

377
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,320
- Why? - I was sleepy, so I fell asleep in there.

378
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,359
- Fell asleep in the toilet? - Why did you sleep there?

379
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,559
- Why not the sofa? - Funny.

380
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,399
Hold on. Stop! Stop!

381
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,199
Well…

382
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,760
How about I make you some more food?

383
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,560
- Don't go yet. - Going already?

384
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,320
Please come back soon.

385
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,919
Bye.

386
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,919
Tell me which is it?

387
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,799
A sister or a wife?

388
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,799
I told you she's my sister.

389
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,719
Are you sure she's your sister?

390
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,600
Are you sure she's not your sugar baby?

391
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,159
- If someone says that Moei… - That's okay.

392
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,359
Moei is Thian's biological sister,

393
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,000
I would believe it.

394
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,960
You two look so much alike.

395
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,280
You're damn right.

396
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,039
Moei, whenever you're free,

397
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,319
can you babysit my dogs and cats at my home?

398
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,719
They're so friendly.

399
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,919
They're fluffy, always wagging their tails.

400
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,799
The food you cook is so delicious. Can I come and eat here regularly?

401
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,840
Sure, you're always welcome.

402
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,519
You're so adorable and so kind.

403
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,280
No wonder Thian doesn't want us to come here.

404
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,879
He's protective of his sister.

405
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,879
Yeah, that must be it.

406
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,640
He didn't want us to know he had a sister.

407
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
Thian said you're working in interior design.

408
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,440
- Yes. - Really?

409
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,279
- I really want to see your work. - Yeah.

410
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,160
You don't want to see it, Beer. It's not good.

411
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,679
I'm just trying to get by.

412
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,400
I'm afraid she'll put the company out of business.

413
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,599
Thian, don't joke around like that.

414
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,720
I'm not joking around. I mean it.

415
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,079
How could you say things like that?

416
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,199
She's a girl. Be nice to her.

417
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,480
Guys, hold on.

418
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,800
Can you stop hitting on my sister?

419
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,240
Is it that obvious?

420
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,399
I'm just being funny.

421
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,679
Would you like some spicy chicken feet salad?

422
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,360
My gout is acting up. I don't really eat chicken.

423
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Want some?

424
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,960
Eat this, so you can shut up.

425
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,560
Thank you.

426
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,360
I can't say no, can I?

427
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,039
Thian. Have all your friends left?

428
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,080
Why? You miss them already?

429
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,360
That's not it.

430
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
But your friends are funny.

431
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,880
Do they already have girlfriends?

432
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,199
Why do you ask? Are you sad if they do?

433
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,120
No, not at all.

434
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,080
They're not my type.

435
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,400
What's your type then?

436
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,080
I like a clever guy.

437
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,400
A very clever guy.

438
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Why?

439
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,039
I don't know.

440
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,720
Maybe because…

441
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
I am not a clever one.

442
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,680
That's true.

443
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,800
Thian.

444
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
You didn't have to agree with me.

445
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Hey.

446
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,600
Watch your step.

447
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,520
- I know. - I'm wearing a long skirt today too.

448
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,040
- Be careful. - I will.

449
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,640
- Just put it there. - Hey.

450
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,760
What the heck?

451
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,040
- Don't tell me we're stationed right here. - I hate moving.

452
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,120
We got more stuff but there's no more room.

453
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,359
Where should we put them? On our heads?

454
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,200
Come on. We'll manage it.

455
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,640
What's all this commotion?

456
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,079
All right. Now that everyone's here,

457
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,519
I'll introduce you to the new architect

458
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,400
who's going to help us in design.

459
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,520
And more importantly, he's going to be our new team leader.

460
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,320
Ta-da.

461
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,880
I'm Thiarawat Navanavakul.

462
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,439
After you're done unpacking, Let's meet.

463
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,560
So we can discuss how to work together.

464
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Come with me.

465
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Dad.

466
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,520
This is Thiarawat.

467
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,559
Oh, I recognize you.

468
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,160
I'm glad to meet you in person.

469
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Yes, Mr. Baramee.

470
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,200
I've just arrived. Yes.

471
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Excuse me.

472
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,320
We'll talk next time.

473
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,080
We'll be seeing us more often.

474
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,840
Please go ahead. I'll be right behind you.

475
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,359
Don't be too long.

476
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,440
I won't.

477
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,000
What does your father mean?

478
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,319
Why would we meet more often?

479
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,440
I don't like to lose.

480
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,999
When I want something, I always get it.

481
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,799
And you're something I want.

482
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,480
I'll tell you what.

483
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,200
This time...

484
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,040
will be your first time to lose.

485
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,160
Because I'm not an item you can want.

486
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,440
For all those times, think of it as a charity.

487
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,640
It's this mouth

488
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,039
that I want to win over.

489
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,959
But that's okay.

490
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,400
We'll be seeing a lot of each other anyway.

491
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,800
This is the list of real estate development companies

492
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,999
and government agencies

493
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,040
that my father and I have connections with.

494
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,399
I'm not saying that our connections can guarantee the projects.

495
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,479
We'll still have to prove ourselves.

496
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,240
But we'll get intel faster and more in depth,

497
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
and more advantage over other companies.

498
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,200
The connections you're talking about,

499
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,080
you mean Mr. Pondej, your husband?

500
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,120
I understand you might have some concerns about that.

501
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,159
I know very well

502
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,399
that my husband's reputation isn't so good.

503
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,319
But neither my father nor I

504
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,440
have ever been involved in Pondej's work.

505
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,359
My father is a lawful man.

506
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,240
He doesn't like dirty politics.

507
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,239
And more importantly,

508
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,080
he's my ex-husband now.

509
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,680
We got a divorce.

510
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,640
I can't take it anymore.

511
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,839
How could he be our boss?

512
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,639
We are an interior design company.

513
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,200
Kang, but Thian…

514
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,719
Mr. Thiarawat is an architect. It should be fine.

515
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,760
Right?

516
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,279
Yes, that's right.

517
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,040
How could it fine?

518
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Have you seen their profiles?

519
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,679
They're in different line of work. How can they help us?

520
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,120
Besides, what were they thinking, sending Chad to management,

521
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,680
and sending these people to us?

522
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,000
He wasn't sent here to support us.

523
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,680
He's sent here to keep an eye on us.

524
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,759
And he's ordering us around and non-stop since we got here.

525
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,360
He told us to categorize all projects at Hammoc for group, year, type.

526
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,319
How is that interior design work?

527
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,719
I asked you to do that

528
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,959
because I'd like to know how Hammoc's performance dropped dramatically

529
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,720
in the last couple of years.

530
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,720
I'd like to see all of your projects

531
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,040
so that we can analyze and find the cause.

532
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,400
Now, you are TPC's employees.

533
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,320
So your work must be of a higher standard and quality.

534
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,759
As the team leader of every one of you,

535
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,240
I have to control the quality of your work

536
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,800
because every project is my responsibility.

537
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,400
- Do you understand now? - Yes, Sir.

538
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,960
I understand.

539
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,440
Hey.

540
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
That's…

541
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,800
Hey, it's Thian's girl.

542
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,960
Yeah.

543
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,959
Hi, are you here to see Thian?

544
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,359
- Yes. - He's not here.

545
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,000
By the way, are you and Thian still…

546
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
seeing each other?

547
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
No.

548
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,360
How could I be dating him?

549
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,879
I don't want to be a homewrecker.

550
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,680
- What? - A homewrecker?

551
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,880
What do you mean by a homewrecker?

552
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,759
Are you saying he's dating someone else?

553
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,519
Hasn't he told you that he's married?

554
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
- What? - What?

555
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Thian is married?

556
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,439
- That can't be right. - Look.

557
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,799
I think you've been fooled.

558
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,599
I'm his best buddy.

559
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,719
There's no way that he is married.

560
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,239
If you believe that,

561
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,079
then the fact that a dolphin can give birth to a puppy is more believable.

562
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,679
But he really told me that he's married.

563
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,399
Look, Thian is our best buddy.

564
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,919
If he was married,

565
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,079
we would have been his best men at his wedding.

566
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,639
Besides, I know everything about him,

567
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,920
I know him in and out.

568
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,919
Inside his house, outside his house, then outside the country.

569
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,319
I know all. So I can assure, Thian doesn't have a girlfriend,

570
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,399
and he's not married.

571
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,240
- Confirmed! - Confirmed!

572
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,159
Thian doesn't have a girlfriend, and he's not married.

573
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,000
- Confirmed. - Confirmed!

574
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,640
I told you we shouldn't meet again.

575
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,520
- Thian, calm down. - Stay out of it.

576
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,679
Why are you here?

577
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,800
Are you really not going to talk to me nicely?

578
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,160
If you reject me,

579
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,920
be sure to hold on tight to your chair.

580
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
What does that mean?

581
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,679
My father is one of TPC's shareholders now.

582
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,839
He has the power to transfer you

583
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,360
or decide on your future.

584
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,359
And I'm here today to see Mr. Baramee.

585
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,040
If you don't believe me, you can go ask him.

586
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,360
Do what you want.

587
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,599
If you fire me, I can work somewhere else.

588
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,519
So many companies are waiting in line to hire me.

589
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,120
Just go back and leave me alone.

590
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,800
I don't think I can do that.

591
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,640
I chose to play this game.

592
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,440
I'll have to win.

593
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,840
And I bet

594
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
that in the end,

595
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,680
you'll lose it to me.

596
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
- Whoa. - Oh my.

597
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Jeez.

598
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,800
She's so aggressive.

599
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,959
Thian, which cheek did she kiss you on?

600
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,559
This one, I can smell it.

601
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
- You could? - Yeah.

602
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,200
Hang on. I didn't get a thing they were talking.

603
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,280
Calm down, man. Don't lose your cool.

604
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,959
By the way, I have to say Yada has invested a lot in you.

605
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,959
She had her dad buy the company's shares,

606
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,479
hoping to make you her husband.

607
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,640
We should give her the title, "the fiercest woman of the year."

608
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Wait.

609
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,799
Before I came in, what were you talking to her?

610
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,960
He told her a lot, man.

611
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,879
Hey.

612
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,399
- That's Moei. - Yeah.

613
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,120
What's she doing here? Moei!

614
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Moei!

615
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,800
- Moei! - Moei!

616
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,479
Oh, hey! Moei! It's really you!

617
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,920
- Yes. - Don't try to hide. I recognize you.

618
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,040
Are you waiting for Thian?

619
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,399
No.

620
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
No?

621
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,880
Well, I…

622
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,160
- I… - She's with Hammoc.

623
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,160
It's her first day here.

624
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
- Yes. - Oh. That's great.

625
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,200
Now I'll be more motivated to do my job.

626
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,439
Gosh, Beer.

627
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,759
Since we're co-workers,

628
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,039
how about we get something to eat together?

629
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,360
- How about that? - Let's go.

630
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
I'm hungry.

631
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,680
I'm afraid she'll put the company out of business.

632
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,799
Thian, don't joke around like that.

633
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,159
By the way, have you told him yet

634
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,240
that we're going to work at TPC?

635
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,679
Imagine, if he sees us working at TPC,

636
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,360
it's going to be a living hell for you for sure.

637
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,199
- How long have you known? - About what?

638
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,319
About your company merging with mine?

639
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,759
So what do we do next?

640
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,280
We stay away from each other.

641
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,080
We act normal.

642
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,120
Moei.

643
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,200
Kob.

644
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,480
It smells so good. I'll dig in now.

645
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,000
Oh, condiments first.

646
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,760
- Would you like some condiments? - No, I'm good.

647
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,720
Just dig in.

648
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,360
I'm so hungry.

649
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,319
- Kob. - Hmm?

650
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,119
Do you want to talk about something?

651
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,720
I was just thinking…

652
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,559
I asked you to dinner many times before, but you were always busy.

653
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,559
And today, I'm having dinner with you.

654
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,079
I wish we went to a nicer place.

655
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,280
But, well...

656
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,680
Here, eat up.

657
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,879
Why did you give me that?

658
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,480
You seem very hungry.

659
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,000
It's all right.

660
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,880
Mr. Noppadol, you can check the BOQ first.

661
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,719
If you're not satisfied, we can make adjustment.

662
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,120
All right.

663
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,800
Please excuse me for a moment.

664
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,800
I can't. I'm busy.

665
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,439
I'm about to go into a meeting.

666
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,640
I'm so sorry, Thian. I want to help you.

667
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,159
But I have to go talk to Chet right now.

668
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,760
Yes, Thian?

669
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,160
Yes.

670
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,119
I can't find them.

671
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,800
How could you not? They must be on the desk.

672
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,880
Look again.

673
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,280
I've looked several times already.

674
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,280
You're so inept.

675
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,240
Mr. Noppadol's asking to see you. He has another appointment.

676
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,159
All right, I'll give you half an hour.

677
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,199
Find it and bring it to me right away.

678
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,360
Okay.

679
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,000
Only 15 minutes.

680
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,280
How will I make it?

681
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,600
Mister, can you go faster? I'm running late.

682
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,400
Are you all right?

683
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,200
I'm okay. Let's go.

684
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Let's go.

685
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,880
I'm here to see Mr. Thiarawat.

686
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,640
He just left a little while ago.

687
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,079
I went upstairs to deliver the document.

688
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,760
I didn't realize you were here.

689
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,000
It took me long enough to find it.

690
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,200
You dropped it on the floor.

691
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,839
You couldn't do this easy task.

692
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,280
How can you handle a bigger one?

693
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,120
Luckily, the client let me email him this later.

694
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,520
Keep in mind, in our line of work,

695
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,160
punctuality is the most important.

696
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,640
I'm sorry.

697
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,960
He forgot his documents. How could he blame Moei?

698
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,720
- This isn't right. - Exactly.

699
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,679
I was slow and couldn't find the documents.

700
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,560
Luckily, the client is not upset with him.

701
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,960
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

702
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,560
Come on.

703
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,440
Oyua.

704
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,400
Oyua.

705
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,520
You're the only one who cares about me.

706
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,280
Thank you, Oyua.

707
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,440
(Sterilized gauze)

708
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,440
Thian, thank you so much.

709
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,240
Thank you so much, Thian.

710
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,440
What have you got there, Honey?

711
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,040
I've brought a small gift for your wife, Sir.

712
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,360
You're so thoughtful.

713
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,839
I really appreciate it, Ms. Yada.

714
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,239
It's my pleasure.

715
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,640
Well.

716
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,679
I really envy you.

717
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,360
You have a beautiful and smart wife like Ms. Yada to support you.

718
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,240
Where did you find such a great wife?

719
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,720
I have to say that I just got lucky,

720
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,080
that Yada chose to look at me.

721
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,320
I'm the one who's lucky.

722
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,880
- Goodbye. - Goodbye, Sir.

723
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,000
You're so good at acting, Honey.

724
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,880
I like it when you're this obedient.

725
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,400
So you won't get hurt again.

726
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,280
Divorce me.

727
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,480
We don't love each other anymore.

728
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,320
Why do we have to put up with it?

729
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,640
I'm begging you.

730
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,680
Please give me back my life.

731
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,720
But I'm still having fun with you, Honey.

732
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,520
- You're so selfish! - If I'm selfish.

733
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,840
then you're money-obsessed!

734
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,079
Aren't we a perfect match?

735
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,119
Have you ever loved me all this time?

736
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,440
Or do you only see me as an object?

737
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,359
Is that why you always hurt me?

738
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,719
Don't blame me!

739
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,440
It's because of you.

740
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,800
You're self-centered and never have enough.

741
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,680
That's why I look for happiness elsewhere.

742
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,680
And from now on,

743
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,359
don't ever bring up divorce again.

744
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,720
You hear me?

745
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,520
If you don't want your beautiful face

746
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,160
to have scars on it.

747
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,920
And don't ever think of going back to that guy.

748
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,880
Because he's really married.

749
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,840
Thian.

750
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,400
Thian.

751
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,720
Thian!

752
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
Thian!

753
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,400
Thian, wait!

754
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,040
Thian!

755
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,840
Thian!

756
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,160
I won't let you walk away from me like this.

757
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,640
Do you know I've waited for you all day?

758
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,080
So what?

759
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,999
What are you doing?

760
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
If you won't talk to me,

761
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,480
I'll have my way with you here.

762
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,439
Are you crazy? Do you have no shame?

763
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,880
I have nothing to lose anymore.

764
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,040
Listen to me.

765
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,200
We have nothing to talk anymore.

766
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,840
Go back to your place.

767
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,400
I don't want trouble.

768
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,800
- Go away. - Thian.

769
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,639
No! I'm not going.

770
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,960
Let go of me!

771
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,800
Thian.

772
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,680
Moei.

773
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,680
So, it's this girl?

774
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,800
Just look at her. You really made her your wife?

775
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
I don't believe it.

776
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,720
- If you don't… - That's up to you.

777
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,519
But I'm married to him.

778
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,320
Here. See this?

779
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,760
If your husband could really check it like you told Thian,

780
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,840
then you should know we signed the marriage certificate.

781
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,360
People sign the marriage certificate all the time.

782
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,040
But that doesn't mean they actually live as husband and wife.

783
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,080
Why is this so hard for you to understand?

784
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,759
Or I need to act like a married couple like you did earlier.

785
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,200
Huh?

786
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,400
Thian and I, we're taught to have shame.

787
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,120
I don't think…

788
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,320
I can do what you just did.

789
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,840
Moei, let's go home.

790
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,600
Let's go, Thian.

791
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,680
Bye.

792
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,720
Bye.

793
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,160
Thian.

794
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,400
I don't think that woman

795
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,519
will leave you alone easily.

796
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,800
Don't worry about her.

797
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,080
If we stay away from her, she can't do anything.

798
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,679
- Hey. - What?

799
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,440
When will you take it off?

800
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,520
- The ring. - Right now.

801
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,560
I forgot.

802
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,440
What are you doing?

803
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,680
Uh, well…

804
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,440
I brought you the towel.

805
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,719
Your hair is wet.

806
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,999
- I don't want you to catch a cold. - Forget it.

807
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,640
We can't just forget it.

808
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,239
All right, forget it.

809
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,240
I'll put the towel right here then.

810
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,760
Um.

811
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,320
Hi, everyone.

812
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,679
My name is Natheerin Sawadhirat.

813
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,319
Today is my first day here.

814
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,599
Please be friends with me.

815
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,640
Please welcome your new friend.

816
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,160
Next.

817
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,760
Mom says a new start may not be easy.

818
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,320
But it won't be too difficult for us to handle.

819
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,520
Natheerin.

820
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,120
- Natheerin. You're Natheerin, right? - Yes.

821
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,320
- So today is your first day? - Yes.

822
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,760
I'm Tum.

823
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,080
And I'm Moei.

824
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,680
- Moei? - Yeah.

825
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,600
Hey, that's a cool name.

826
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,960
What does it mean?

827
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,479
Moei is the name of a river in the north.

828
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,600
It's where I'm from.

829
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,320
Hey, that's cute.

830
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,439
The bell rang, so we have to get to class.

831
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,039
But I have to pee.

832
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,679
- Oh. - I'll see you

833
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,960
- at the home economics classroom, okay? - Okay.

834
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,840
Wait.

835
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,240
Tum.

836
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,080
Where is the class?

837
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,040
I'm now five minutes late.

838
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,680
Excuse me?

839
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,440
Yes?

840
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,640
Where's the home economics room?

841
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,920
I don't know either.

842
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,800
But if you can't find it, you can come and sit with me.

843
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,439
- Okay? - Never mind.

844
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,480
Hey, hang on.

845
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,240
You're so cute. What grade are you in?

846
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,200
So?

847
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,799
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

848
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,640
She asked me where the home economics room was.

849
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,360
So I told her I didn't know.

850
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,280
Oh. Damn.

851
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,440
Home economics room, right?

852
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
It's here.

853
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,280
Thank you.

854
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,240
Okay.

855
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,920
Hey, Moei.

856
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,319
Maybe the seniors.

857
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,319
- They're practicing. Come on. - Yeah?

858
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,560
Come take a look.

859
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,120
There, see?

860
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,240
Wow.

861
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,000
- He's so cool. - Yeah.

862
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,840
- Auntie. - Hmm?

863
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,880
Thank you so much.

864
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,360
If it weren't for you,

865
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,079
I would never go to a good school like this one.

866
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,679
You don't have to thank me.

867
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,239
Your mom and I have known each other for a long time.

868
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,960
Prapha is like a sister to me.

869
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:06,720
It's nothing at all. It's nothing I can handle.

870
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,720
If you want to thank me,

871
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,360
you just have to study hard.

872
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,120
I will.

873
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,360
Who's there?

874
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,839
Hey, it's broken!

875
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,640
Don't let me find out who did this.

876
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,520
If I find you, I'll kick your ass.

877
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,680
Oh, no.

878
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,440
Who is that? His voice sounds so scary.

879
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,360
Oh.

880
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,440
Who did you run from?

881
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,080
I'm so sorry, Auntie.

882
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,759
I should go home now.

883
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,719
- Goodbye. - Sure, bye.

884
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,040
Watch your step.

885
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,279
Mom, who's that?

886
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,520
That's Prapha's daughter.

887
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,840
Sajee has two sons.

888
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,319
Her oldest son is Ri.

889
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,159
He is studying engineering in Bangkok.

890
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,720
The younger one is Thian.

891
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,679
He is a senior at your school.

892
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,959
I heard that

893
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,759
he's very stern and very private.

894
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,680
Is he a dog or a person?

895
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,279
This girl.

896
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:34,440
Can somebody please get me an inhalant? I'm going to faint.

897
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,960
- Aunt Jee. - Oh, dear.

898
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,040
- What's the matter? - Get me an inhalant. I'm going to faint.

899
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,440
What's wrong, Mom?

900
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,520
I just found out

901
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,720
he forged my signature on his school report last semester.

902
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,079
I'm tired of going to the school to talk to the teachers.

903
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,519
Come on, Mom. Calm down.

904
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,160
Thian is always like that. Aren't you used to it by now?

905
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,679
Aunt Jee.

906
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,239
Is your son's name Thiarawat?

907
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,360
Yes.

908
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,519
The graduation day is in two weeks already.

909
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,960
Yeah.

910
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,639
That's right.

911
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,200
- I've reminded you so many times. - I almost forgot.

912
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,960
Anyway, it's in two weeks, okay? There!

913
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,239
It's in two weeks.

914
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,000
- Only two weeks. - I'm about to find out

915
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,439
who my peer mentor is.

916
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,479
Yes.

917
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,960
Don't you want to know?

918
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,280
Aren't you excited?

919
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:32,920
Mr. Thiarawat Navanavakul.

920
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,799
It's Thian!

921
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,199
Thian is your peer mentor!

922
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,080
He's your idol.

923
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,520
Don't let me find out who did this.

924
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,440
If I find you, I'll kick your ass.

925
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,240
I'm Thiarawat Navanavakul.

926
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,640
I'm the president of 65th class.

927
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,840
Just because you're the class president, you think you can do anything?

928
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
It's here.

929
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,360
As the representative of senior students

930
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,280
who are graduating this academic year,

931
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,440
I would like to say our farewell

932
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,360
to all our teachers.

933
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,280
We'd like to dedicate this song

934
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,800
to all the students.

935
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,640
Moei!

936
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,599
Moei!

937
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,840
What is it?

938
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,040
Hey.

939
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,960
- What is it? - I have something for you.

940
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,040
What is it?

941
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,400
It's from our teacher.

942
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,480
Thian left it before the end of the semester.

943
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,079
- Thian? - Yes.

944
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,599
Did Thian really give it to me?

945
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,679
Yes! Let's open it.

946
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,079
- Let me see. - No.

947
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,159
- Let me see. - Oh my god!

948
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,559
- Let me see. - No way.

949
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,719
- It's only for me. - Hey, wait.

950
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,400
- Let me see. - Thank you, Tum.

951
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,440
Let me see it too.

952
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,120
Thian gave this to me!

953
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
(Peer Mentor)

954
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,520
(Can you help me with my homework?)

955
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,560
It's okay even you don't remember me as your peer mentee.

956
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:18,520
Because I'm here with you right now.

957
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,039
And this...

958
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,400
is enough to brighten my days.

959
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:37,080
Once I was asked what marriage was.

960
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,319
There are many answers.

961
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,640
Some say marriage is happiness.

962
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,320
While others...

963
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,920
say that marriage is suffering.

964
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,600
Thian, who puts the ring on that finger?

965
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,880
But for me,

966
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,720
marriage is about taking care of the person you love,

967
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,840
making him feel warm and safe every day.

968
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,560
We might have to sacrifice our own happiness sometimes,

969
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,720
but if that means we can see our loved one smile.

970
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,560
I do think it's worth it.

971
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,479
Hey, guys.

972
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,680
- Check this out. - What the heck?

973
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,800
Have you seen this? Here it is.

974
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,679
This Facebook page is famous now.

975
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,759
I hear its admin is an interior designer.

976
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,239
- Really? - If you go on this page,

977
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,639
you'll see beautiful photos and lots of cool design tips.

978
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,799
Give me that. Hey, Thian!

979
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,999
- Thian, see this! - Beer!

980
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,359
- Beer! - Thian, take a look at this.

981
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,880
- It's my phone. - What the hell?

982
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,159
- What the heck? - Take a look here.

983
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,640
"Designing a room is like designing love.

984
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,919
The room should make the dweller feel safe and happy."

985
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,000
That's nonsense.

986
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,120
I'm sure she's never had a boyfriend.

987
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,040
She's probably living in fantasy.

988
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,080
- Thian, how could you say that? - Right.

989
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,200
Everything you said

990
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,959
is absolutely correct.

991
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,399
- Right, guys? Right? - Oh, man.

992
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,919
You're licking his boots up to his knees.

993
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,880
I'm not a dog. Stop talking, let's meet in a game.

994
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,640
- Come here. - All right.

995
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,320
What's with you, Thian?

996
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,840
Hey.

997
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,640
What's the name of the page?

998
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,679
A Love to Share.

999
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,120
Didn't you say it's nonsense?

1000
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,880
It seems you haven't experienced true love.

1001
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,239
Let me tell you something.

1002
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,200
Love is not always full of roses like you think.

1003
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,000
What you wrote on your page was nothing near reality.

1004
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,000
Don't make people misunderstand.

1005
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,600
Mr. TecTien, I guess you've never met true love,

1006
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,159
as you're bitter towards love.

1007
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:37,320
Let me guess. You have never been successful in love even once.

1008
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,960
Ouch!

1009
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,280
What the hell is wrong with you?

1010
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,120
"True love doesn't exist...

1011
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:50,360
So... stop imagining it."

1012
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,199
Stop imagining it?

1013
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,559
Calm down. What's the matter?

1014
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,599
Thian, you brat.

1015
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,760
Why did you have to be mean to her?

1016
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,279
You're such a jerk.

1017
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,400
- What's up? - He wrote a mean comment on the page.

1018
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,839
- What? Thian, you… - I wasn't mean.

1019
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,200
Why? Do you have a problem?

1020
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,080
No.

1021
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:16,800
- You have a problem. - It's you. He's asking you.

1022
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,199
- I never have a problem. - Why did you ask him?

1023
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,919
- I never had problems with him. - Me too.

1024
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,040
Yes, Chet.

1025
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,840
Yes.

1026
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,880
Okay.

1027
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,439
Ms. Yada, she's a shareholder's daughter.

1028
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,160
I don't want you to be too cold towards her.

1029
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,160
I totally understand.

1030
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,199
But I'm not asking a lot from you.

1031
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,600
Just don't act like you don't know her.

1032
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,800
Mr. Thada is a major shareholder now.

1033
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,800
I don't want you to have any problems.

1034
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,439
I will if I do what you're asking.

1035
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,159
Ms. Yada is a married woman.

1036
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,960
It wouldn't be appropriate.

1037
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,799
Don't worry about that.

1038
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,399
She just got a divorce.

1039
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,519
She's single now.

1040
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,960
Her marital status has nothing to do with me anyway.

1041
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,039
Because I'm actually married.

1042
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,280
- Hmm? - What?

1043
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,000
- You have to resign. - You want me to quit?

1044
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,440
Yes.

1045
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,880
Hand in your resignation tomorrow.

1046
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,799
No, I won't quit.

1047
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,400
I love this job so much.

1048
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,799
You said it yourself.

1049
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,039
If Yada knows we work in the same place,

1050
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,960
the whole office will know

1051
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,519
that we're married.

1052
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,759
Yes, I said that.

1053
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:54,040
But you're the one who don't want people to find out, not me.

1054
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,040
Why do I have to quit?

1055
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,919
And quitting won't solve the problem.

1056
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,200
What are you suggesting?

1057
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,800
Listen. Why attached to that place?

1058
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,640
With your skill, you can work anywhere.

1059
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,160
How about this?

1060
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,719
Tomorrow, I'll get you a new job, okay?

1061
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,120
Not okay.

1062
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,640
Are you being difficult?

1063
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,119
You're the one being difficult.

1064
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,679
Are you insulting me?

1065
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,480
No, I'm not insulting you.

1066
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,399
But think about it.

1067
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,679
If I quit,

1068
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,279
who will protect you when she comes to the office?

1069
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,559
Or what if her husband or Aunt Jee found out?

1070
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,440
You'll be in trouble.

1071
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,160
I think the best solution right now

1072
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,799
is to tell everyone that we're married.

1073
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,520
No. No way.

1074
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,920
What is it that you fear more?

1075
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,240
Having that woman chasing you

1076
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,239
and her husband coming to kill you

1077
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,119
or other people knowing that we're married?

1078
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,600
I said no, and that's the end of it.

1079
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:01,920
You're selfish.

1080
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,040
You never care how I feel.

1081
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,799
Instead of solving together, you're letting me take all the burden.

1082
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,840
Hey!

1083
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,920
You're way out of line.

1084
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,879
How did I not think about how you feel?

1085
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,000
I don't want to tell people we're married.

1086
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,479
It's for your own sake.

1087
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:22,680
I don't want you known as a divorced woman after we are divorced.

1088
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,720
I'm doing this for you.

1089
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,559
Can't you figure that out?

1090
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,080
That's not true.

1091
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,799
It's just an excuse.

1092
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,720
All you have are excuses.

1093
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,400
- Moei! - You never loved me at all.

1094
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,360
How did I not think about how you feel?

1095
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,560
I don't want to tell people we're married.

1096
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,960
It's for your own sake.

1097
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,760
I don't want you known as a divorced woman after we are divorced.

1098
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,120
I'm concerned about you.

1099
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,200
Can't you figure that out?

1100
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:30,840
Thian.

1101
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,360
Oh. You're here.

1102
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,839
Who are you with?

1103
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,120
- I am… - My girlfriend.

1104
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,480
Take a seat.

1105
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,600
Uh...

1106
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,520
Thian.

1107
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,000
I think she's mad.

1108
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,440
- Forget about her. - But didn't she come…

1109
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,040
The movie is about to start.

1110
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:05,960
Okay.

1111
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,560
I'm nothing but a buffer, am I?

1112
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,320
Why would we meet more often?

1113
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,120
It's this mouth

1114
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,199
that I want to win over.

1115
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,960
We'll be seeing a lot of each other anyway.

1116
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,560
What? It's 11 am?

1117
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,840
Oh! It's really 11 am.

1118
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,880
Who turned off my alarm?

1119
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,440
Gosh! Whoa!

1120
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,560
Oh.

1121
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,880
Just have a day off tomorrow.

1122
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,120
Moei, why are you so late?

1123
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,079
- Huh? - My alarm didn't go off.

1124
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,240
Your alarm didn't go off?

1125
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,040
Hey.

1126
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,599
- What? - Your ring.

1127
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,480
- Shit! - Exactly.

1128
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,800
Luckily, you saw it before Thian.

1129
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,559
- Hey. - Don't tell me it's not coming off.

1130
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,840
What do I do?

1131
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,839
Let's go to the bathroom, use some soap.

1132
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,640
Come on, let's go.

1133
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,480
Come on. Quickly.

1134
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,879
It's not coming off.

1135
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,240
I just tried it on and forgot to take it off.

1136
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,480
I'm in so much trouble.

1137
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,840
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1138
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,120
Come on.

1139
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,640
Wait.

1140
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,679
- Hello, Chad. - Hello, Chad.

1141
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,840
- Hello. Wait. - Let's go.

1142
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,680
I need to talk to Moei.

1143
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,120
I need to talk to Moei in private.

1144
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,080
Thian! Thian!

1145
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,199
Thian. You have to help Moei.

1146
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,640
What is it now?

1147
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,639
It's Chad. You know he's a real creep.

1148
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,839
He tries to take advantage of Moei many times.

1149
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,919
Moei wouldn't go along.

1150
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,320
But I fear that this time, he's really doing it.

1151
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,239
That's not my problem.

1152
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,799
How could you say that when you and Moei are…

1153
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,760
Stop it.

1154
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,719
What did she tell you?

1155
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:00,040
Moei and I never have secrets, okay?

1156
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,079
You won't get away this time.

1157
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,559
I'm married, Chad. I'm married.

1158
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,040
I'm married.

1159
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:14,239
Moei, it's just a ring. It can't prove anything.

1160
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,440
I'll be gentle, I promise.

1161
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,640
Moei.

1162
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,119
You're here.

1163
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,880
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1164
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,320
What about the work I assigned you?

1165
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,599
Oh, no, not yet.

1166
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,600
Not yet?

1167
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,440
Then what are you doing here?

1168
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,160
Kob, I'm asking you.

1169
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,959
Is Moei really married?

1170
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,399
I don't know.

1171
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,359
How could you not know? You're her senior.

1172
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,960
You have to find out if it's true or not.

1173
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,080
Got it?

1174
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,559
Tum, tell me, is Moei really married?

1175
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,839
When did she? Why didn't we know?

1176
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,199
Who's her husband?

1177
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,200
What?

1178
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,240
- What's going on? - Oh, Moei.

1179
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,120
Moei, are you really married?

1180
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,079
There's the ring. She's really married.

1181
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,960
- Oh! - It's true.

1182
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,600
You have a husband now.

1183
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,080
Why don't you introduce him to us?

1184
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,959
Ask him to treat us to a meal.

1185
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,079
Or we all will come to your house.

1186
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,880
Well, uh…

1187
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,960
Look at that. Look at the ring.

1188
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,560
- Let me see the ring. - It's beautiful.

1189
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,680
Hey, I got some news.

1190
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:08,840
Moei is married.

1191
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,200
- What? - Really?

1192
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,959
Here, the group chat is blowing up.

1193
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,360
So, who's her husband?

1194
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,159
Thian is not in today?

1195
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,240
That's right.

1196
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,279
- Where is he? - He's on-site upcountry.

1197
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,799
What province?

1198
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,880
- Trang. - Loei.

1199
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,519
- I mean... - Uh...

1200
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,239
To Loei in the morning, and then off to Trang.

1201
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,759
Right, guys?

1202
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,040
- Yes. - That's right.

1203
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,559
(Massage Parlor) Valid for two hours, Use it.

1204
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,279
If Yada comes looking for Thian.

1205
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,119
Tell her he's not here.

1206
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,799
Tell her he is off somewhere.

1207
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,159
Understand?

1208
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,199
- Yes. - Yes.

1209
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:10,920
Therefore, he won't be coming in today, Ms. Yada.

1210
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,160
That's all right.

1211
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,040
Anyway, please tell Thian

1212
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,680
that I'll be back.

1213
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,080
I won't stop trying.

1214
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,680
At least, he is safe for a day.

1215
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,160
(Beer: Things went as planned.)

1216
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,600
(Nott: Yada has left.)

1217
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,240
(Toon: But she said she'd be back.)

1218
01:27:50,342 --> 01:27:52,048
Why is he back early?

1219
01:27:55,939 --> 01:27:57,680
You know what he wants with you.

1220
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,400
How could you let yourself be alone with him?

1221
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,199
Try to avoid him next time.

1222
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,920
If it's necessary, use my name. Got it?

1223
01:28:11,346 --> 01:28:12,800
Hey. What's this?

1224
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,799
Thian, don't yell at me just yet.

1225
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,119
I can explain.

1226
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,439
I tried to take it off. It got red, very red. But it…

1227
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:23,120
You told your friend about our secret,

1228
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,080
Now you're wearing the wedding ring?

1229
01:28:45,197 --> 01:28:47,520
Thian, I just want to say I'm sorry.

1230
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,959
Jeez! Thian!

1231
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,399
That's gross! Turn it off right now.

1232
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,599
I won't.

1233
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,600
- That's for disobeying me. - What?

1234
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,239
When did I disobey you?

1235
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,240
There.

1236
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,360
Take it off.

1237
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,600
I meant the ring.

1238
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,880
Why don't you take it off when I say so?

1239
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,520
What? You want to keep stalling?

1240
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,960
I'm not stalling.

1241
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,239
Thian, turn it off!

1242
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,520
I won't. What are you gonna do??

1243
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,120
- Just turn it off! - Moei.

1244
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:26,960
Moei.

1245
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,360
Get it if you can.

1246
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:36,320
I'm tired, you know.

1247
01:29:53,862 --> 01:29:55,319
Thian.

1248
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,839
I wasn't trying to tell people

1249
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,320
that we're married.

1250
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,120
It's just that

1251
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,879
the ring won't come off.

1252
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,520
- What is it now, Thian? - Come here.

1253
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,159
What is that?

1254
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,599
A lubricant.

1255
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,320
No, it's gross!

1256
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,040
Stay still.

1257
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:18,399
It's so sticky.

1258
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:21,480
- It's so sticky and smelly. - Quiet.

1259
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,680
Moei.

1260
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,840
- Moei. - Hey, what?

1261
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,840
- Sorry, what is it? - Why are you smiling?

1262
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,880
Are you losing it?

1263
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,320
Take it.

1264
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,200
Don't wear it again unless it's necessary.

1265
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,920
So do I have to ask you every time

1266
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,279
if it's necessary or not?

1267
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,959
- You're talking back? - I'm not.

1268
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,319
I'm just asking.

1269
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,640
It's the same thing.

1270
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,720
You're younger, no back talk.

1271
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,880
If I see it again, I'll cut off your finger.

1272
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,320
Wash up and go make dinner.

1273
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,680
- I'm hungry. - Okay.

1274
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,200
Thian.

1275
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,800
What do you want to eat?

1276
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,320
Salmon!

1277
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,520
Just how it always ends.

1278
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,760
Salmon it is.

1279
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,200
All my life,

1280
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:38,800
only a few can make me angry and laugh at the same time.

1281
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,840
I wanted to be mad at him.

1282
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:45,440
But I can never be.

1283
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,640
How much do I love him?

1284
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,280
I don't know.

1285
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,640
Why do I love him?

1286
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,120
I don't know that either.

1287
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,279
How long will I love him?

1288
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,800
I can't answer that.

1289
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,360
I guess this is how it's going to be.

1290
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,159
It's hard to explain when it comes to love.

1291
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,519
No matter how mean he is to me,

1292
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,040
I just can't stop loving him.

1293
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:58,640
I hope this joy stay with us for a very long time.

1294
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,520
There's the ring. Moei is really married.

1295
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,880
You really got it bad.

1296
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,640
What a noob.

1297
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,680
This way, please.

1298
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:50,959
And Thian closed another deal so beautifully, everyone.

1299
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,000
Give him a big hand.

1300
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,720
- Bravo! - The deal is closed. The work is sold.

1301
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:57,679
- Thian is coming. - Make way for Thian.

1302
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,600
- He's my buddy. - Thian.

1303
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,639
You didn't understand what I said?

1304
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,840
I'm here to tell you I'm divorced.

1305
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,280
So what?

1306
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,640
I know you're trying to lie to me about you being married.

1307
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,560
And that you need to hide it from your friends.

1308
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,279
But the truth is the truth.

1309
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,879
I know you had to marry Moei

1310
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,479
because my ex-husband was threatening you.

1311
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:27,319
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

1312
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,880
Because it's all over.

1313
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,679
It's over between us too.

1314
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,600
Please move aside.

1315
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:36,720
Thian.

1316
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,840
If you don't talk to me,

1317
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,119
I'll have my dad pull out.

1318
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,799
Be my guest. Do whatever you please.

1319
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,000
It's not my company.

1320
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,279
If what Chet said is true,

1321
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,399
Yada is threatening to pull out

1322
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,079
if you continue to ignore her.

1323
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:00,160
We're going to need your cooperation.

1324
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,840
How so?

1325
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:09,279
You have to make Yada believe

1326
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,959
that the relationship between you and Moei

1327
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,720
is more than what she thinks.

1328
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:48,240
So…

1329
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,960
your husband,

1330
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,280
does he help you with housework?

1331
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,680
Well, the thing is...

1332
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,319
he's a little snobbish.

1333
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:01,120
So he doesn't know how to do housework.

1334
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,760
That's not an excuse.

1335
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,039
Once become a husband, whether he's a top model

1336
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,439
- or a prince from a foreign country, - Yes.

1337
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,839
he shouldn't take advantage of the wives like all of us.

1338
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:18,120
But he's a very private person, Kung.

1339
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,040
So I don't want to bother him.

1340
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,000
What if he's snobbish?

1341
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,279
So what if he's very private?

1342
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,679
We can't be fooled by a guy like that.

1343
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,200
How about stop gossiping

1344
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,080
and get some work done?

1345
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,680
Well…

1346
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,279
- As we've discussed, that's what we'll do. - Yes.

1347
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,079
About the system within the company

1348
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,839
we discussed so seriously earlier.

1349
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,640
- Let's go. - I have an announcement to make.

1350
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,160
From now on, Natheerin

1351
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,800
- will be my assistant. - What?

1352
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,639
Whoa! What are you doing?

1353
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,279
They're soulmates.

1354
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,879
- Let me. - Whoa!

1355
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,959
No, Thian!

1356
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,520
Which law will I have to break

1357
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:22,879
if I force my husband to sleep with me?

1358
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,360
Moei!
