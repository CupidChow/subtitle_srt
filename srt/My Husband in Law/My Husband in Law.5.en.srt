1
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,600
What's going on?

2
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,680
Thian.

3
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,400
Your computer's been hacked.

4
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,800
It never happened in our company before.

5
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,760
Can I see the footage at the hallway?

6
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,039
That's clearly Yada.

7
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,200
Who exactly owns Thian?

8
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,360
You and Moei need to be clingier.

9
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,919
This is a chance for you to prove

10
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,160
whether Hammoc should stay or leave.

11
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,519
What's going on, Thian?

12
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,440
"Only you can stop this game.

13
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
Come back to me

14
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,880
then I'll make it over,

15
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
my love."

16
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,760
Why do you look so startled?

17
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,919
- It's nothing. - Did you do something wrong?

18
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,560
I wouldn't dare.

19
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,359
I'm so terrified of you scolding me.

20
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,080
Give us two beers.

21
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,720
- Yeah, two beers. - Right away.

22
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,240
Hey.

23
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
At three o'clock. Exactly my type.

24
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,920
Fair-skinned, pretty, and all curvy.

25
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
I'll be right back.

26
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,560
Oh, man.

27
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,600
Way too excited.

28
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,760
Hi. Are you by yourself?

29
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,160
I'm with my friends.

30
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,840
Nice. So you are a group of pretty four.

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,040
We are four as well. Would you like to join us?

32
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,640
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

33
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,400
Excuse me.

34
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,240
Jeez.

35
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,320
Stop looking at him.

36
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
You don't even blink.

37
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
Oh.

38
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,560
Is there anything I can help you with?

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,040
Oh, my gosh. You're cute.

40
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
And very polite.

41
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
Can I see your phone?

42
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,720
Come on.

43
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,520
Hey.

44
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,880
Here's my number.

45
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,840
Call me, will you?

46
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,880
See you around.

47
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,480
Gosh, women these days have strange taste.

48
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,240
They like men as tiny as lapdogs.

49
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,720
Jeez.

50
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,600
Hey, did you give her your number?

51
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,800
That's dope.

52
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,319
You even attract the same sex. That's awesome.

53
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,640
How is that awesome?

54
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,040
Come on, don't be mad at them.

55
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,240
Hey.

56
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,080
Your man is looking at us.

57
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,080
- We're leaving. - What? Why?

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,000
I have a bad feeling about this.

59
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,359
Really? Right now?

60
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,679
- Come on. - Hey, wait.

61
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,399
I haven't finished my beer. Yours, too.

62
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,360
Leave it. Let's go.

63
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,480
What's with you?

64
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,440
- Shall we go now? I'm ready. - Yeah, let's go.

65
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,880
You're ready?

66
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,400
Ready for what?

67
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,000
Right. Ready for what?

68
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,520
Come on, don't play dumb.

69
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,720
Your friend told me you wanted to hang out with me.

70
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,640
I didn't mean that.

71
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,080
Right, he didn't mean that.

72
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,559
Or do you want me to do it right here?

73
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,840
- What? - Moei.

74
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,160
His cheeks are so soft.

75
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,880
Come on, babe.

76
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,160
Let's continue.

77
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,280
Moei! No!

78
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,879
No!

79
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,840
Hey! You're a woman!

80
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,720
- What? - She's a woman.

81
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,919
Are you two fooling me?

82
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,159
No, I'm not.

83
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,560
Gosh. You sure are.

84
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,480
Look, your beard is on her nose right now.

85
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
Hey!

86
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,040
Hey, Moei!

87
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,599
- Moei? - What?

88
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,760
Hey, wait.

89
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,320
Stop it!

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,760
What are you doing to my wife?

91
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,360
Honey, they are bullying me.

92
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,040
We're so screwed.

93
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,280
I guess you're asking for a death wish.

94
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,880
Guys.

95
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,879
On a count of three, run for your life.

96
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,440
- Yeah. - Okay.

97
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,360
One.

98
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Two.

99
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,840
Three!

100
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,040
- No, don't! - Where do you think you're going?

101
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,160
Hey, that way!

102
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,400
Gosh, you're so slow.

103
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,760
Let go, Thian!

104
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Thian!

105
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:11,159
Let me down. No one is coming after us.

106
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,920
Thian! Let go of me now!

107
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,720
No one is after us anymore.

108
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,000
It's all your fault.

109
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,680
You nearly got us in trouble.

110
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,520
And what is this?

111
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,320
Why are you disguised like this?

112
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,880
Hey, don't wipe it on me.

113
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,200
Why did you follow me here?

114
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Wait.

115
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,720
Don't tell me Mom told you to come.

116
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,519
That's not it.

117
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,720
What is it then?

118
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,920
I'm just curious.

119
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
I thought Yada might follow you there.

120
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,880
So I came to protect you.

121
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,960
You're not really my wife.

122
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,800
So please.

123
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,560
Can I have some privacy?

124
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,920
All right?

125
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,119
Good evening.

126
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,520
Hello, Ms. Yada.

127
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,119
Thank you so much

128
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,760
for agreeing to work on my case.

129
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,760
I know this might put your job at risk.

130
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,760
I'm always willing to do my best for you.

131
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,320
Here is my suggestion on filing for divorce against your husband.

132
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,640
Do you think you can get rid of me, Thian?

133
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,800
It won't be long

134
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,960
before I can go back to you freely.

135
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,240
And this time,

136
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,320
you can't turn me down.

137
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,920
These are all the footage we could restore.

138
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,800
Holy moly.

139
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,840
Do I really have to go through these all?

140
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,400
Thian, you jerk.

141
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm your slave or what.

142
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,160
Hey, Nott. What are you doing here?

143
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,600
Well, Thian asked me

144
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,360
to look for any suspects from the CCTV footage.

145
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,360
There are hundreds of files. It's gonna take forever.

146
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,760
Oh, really?

147
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,839
Mr. Baramee asked me to check them, too.

148
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,000
Let's join forces then.

149
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,680
Okay.

150
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,080
Shall we start now?

151
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,560
Sure, let's start right now.

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
Where should we start?

153
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,960
- Let's start from here. - Yes.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,160
Click that one.

155
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,679
- I don't think it's this one. - Huh? What?

156
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,360
How about this one?

157
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,720
Okay.

158
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,720
Want some? It's good.

159
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,640
It's all right. Thank you.

160
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,960
Hey.

161
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,759
You can leave if you want. I can take it from here.

162
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,880
No, I'm still good.

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,040
A cockroach! Get it off!

164
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,359
Get it off!

165
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,320
Chet, calm down.

166
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,720
Where did it go?

167
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,560
Where is it now?

168
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,520
- Hold it. - Where is it?

169
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,680
Just stay still.

170
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,320
Where is it?

171
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,560
It's dead now.

172
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm about to die, too.

173
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,680
Whoa.

174
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,880
I got him.

175
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What?

176
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,040
What's up, Nott?

177
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,800
Thian.

178
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,880
The CCTV got a person in black for a split second

179
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
before we lost the visual.

180
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,080
Hey, can you see it clearly

181
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,200
if it's a man or a woman?

182
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,159
No, I can't.

183
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,280
I think Yada and her father hired an insider to do this.

184
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,320
But I don't think Yada

185
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,200
knows anything about this.

186
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,840
That's impossible.

187
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,440
I can feel that she's up to something.

188
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,520
And it's not something good.

189
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,159
Let's continue at the department.

190
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,200
Wait. What?

191
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,759
You still want to discuss? We can do it tomorrow.

192
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,040
- Right. - I'm tired.

193
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,119
Right. I don't know if Gie is waiting for me at home.

194
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,200
Look, everyone has left the office.

195
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,759
Those inside are all worn out.

196
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,639
- Really. - Yeah, my brain can't think now.

197
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,920
- I am so tired. - Me too.

198
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,999
My wife tells me off...

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,959
- Are you listening at all? - Where is he going?

200
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,519
- Thian. - What the heck?

201
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,439
- Come back! - Can I go leave now?

202
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,040
- What's the rush, man? - Can you not run?

203
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,600
My wife is waiting!

204
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,359
"It hurts so much I could die when you're not by my side.

205
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,600
I keep thinking about your body standing in the moonlight.

206
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,040
Oh, my love. Let's start our love all over again.

207
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,640
Let's put all conflicts behind. I want you by my side tonight."

208
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,680
I felt sorry for you at first.

209
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,160
But now,

210
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,239
I really want to see this hacker.

211
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,199
Damn, she's really something.

212
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,599
- Right, guys? - Yeah.

213
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,840
It's not funny.

214
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Hey.

215
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,239
Don't you know how to work?

216
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,360
Why do I get hacked again and again?

217
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
Yes!

218
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,680
Just stop it. I don't want to hear it.

219
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,000
Come see me tomorrow morning.

220
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,480
She's freaking bold.

221
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,719
We were having a meeting right there.

222
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,840
Right.

223
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,240
I'll ask the security guard whether Yada was here.

224
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,759
Wait, Thian!

225
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,800
- Thian, wait! - What the heck?

226
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,600
She didn't come here today.

227
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,720
She's at the fashion show up until now.

228
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,960
- What? - Huh?

229
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,400
How are you sure about this?

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Look at this.

231
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,280
Hi, everyone.

232
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,719
I'm at Elle Fashion Week right now.

233
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,240
I'm going inside now, and I'll give a little tour around.

234
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,800
- Hey. - What?

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,640
If it wasn't Yada, then who was it?

236
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,240
Gosh. Look.

237
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,600
You guys gathered here to make plans,

238
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,919
because you suspect Hammoc was behind the hack?

239
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,080
Oh, no. That's impossible.

240
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,040
- How do you know? - How do you it's them?

241
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,720
They thought I was the one closing down Hammoc.

242
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,880
They might want to take revenge by taking Mr. Thada's side.

243
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,240
Thian, come back to your senses.

244
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,320
You must have watched too many dramas.

245
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm confident that all Hammoc staffs

246
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,719
are understanding enough to accept what's happening.

247
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,559
They wouldn't do anything that stupid.

248
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,320
But you can't be sure about that.

249
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Then,

250
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,440
leave this to me.

251
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,119
You don't have to do anything anymore.

252
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,200
- But I... - No buts.

253
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,440
It's an order. Got it?

254
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,480
Calm down, man.

255
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,120
Calm down, my friend.

256
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,920
Yes, I know.

257
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,480
No one can ever stop what I'm planning to do.

258
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,960
Everything will go on as planned.

259
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,160
Who's that?

260
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,560
Well, I...

261
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,160
That was close, Moei.

262
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,480
Who is this hacker?

263
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,560
Who did I overlook?

264
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,440
Hammoc.

265
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440
How on earth could I overlook someone like Moei?

266
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,840
Nah, this can't be.

267
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,920
How can someone like have skills to her hack computers?

268
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,800
Moei.

269
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,640
Moei, are you sleeping?

270
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
I need to talk to you.

271
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,600
Moei.

272
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,320
Can I use your laptop for a bit?

273
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,400
A Love to Share.

274
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,280
Does she read from this Page?

275
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,880
Well, she's just as delusional.

276
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,080
"Admin, I think my boyfriend is gay."

277
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,360
Admin?

278
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,680
This Facebook page is on fire right now.

279
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,759
I hear its admin is an interior designer.

280
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,400
- Really? - Take a look here.

281
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,519
"Designing a room is like designing love.

282
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,840
The room should make the dweller feel warm

283
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,040
and happy."

284
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,680
Nonsense.

285
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,719
I'm sure she's never had a boyfriend.

286
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,959
She's probably living in fantasy. Delusional.

287
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,320
- Hey. - What?

288
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,680
What's the name of the page?

289
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,800
A Love to Share.

290
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,360
Oh, love and war,

291
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,800
I wonder when it all began.

292
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,759
It could possibly get started long ago.

293
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,479
I think I'm right. I'm sure I'm right.

294
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,240
When one wish to seek for love,

295
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,320
One needs to reserve both mental and physical energy,

296
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,159
As one shall be constantly a battle.

297
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,920
So I wish all of you the best luck.

298
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,439
Seeing your grumpy face, you must be stressed out.

299
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,999
I guess you all must be wondering...

300
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,759
Girls are now afraid to get near you.

301
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,360
...something totally off-topic today.

302
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
Your good look is just irresistible.

303
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,920
Love is like war.

304
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,640
Thian. What's the matter?

305
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,400
- Damn it. - Need help?

306
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,280
"Only you can stop this game.

307
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,280
Come back to me then I'll make it over,

308
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,080
my love."

309
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,840
Seeing your grumpy face, you must be stressed out.

310
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,640
Girls are now afraid to get near you.

311
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,160
Your good look is just irresistible.

312
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,680
That's why I really want you to be mine.

313
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,680
Are you talking about me?

314
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Whoa!

315
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,240
Moei.

316
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,080
You're the admin?

317
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,360
You're the hacker?

318
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,320
No.

319
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,560
This can't be true.

320
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,360
You're not that skillful.

321
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,360
This is just a coincidence.

322
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,840
Did I leave the door open?

323
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,079
(I think my boyfriend is gay. What should I do?)

324
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,480
This isn't where I left off.

325
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
- Whoa! - Thian.

326
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,120
Moei.

327
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,320
It's all right. I am okay.

328
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,920
All right. Well...

329
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,840
I just want to ask if you went inside my room.

330
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,600
No.

331
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,520
All right.

332
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,360
I need your help.

333
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,480
But you can't tell anyone about this.

334
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,840
Narrow down the scope

335
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,480
and recheck thoroughly on one person.

336
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,480
It's Natheerin.

337
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,600
Thian!

338
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,839
I won't put up with this anymore.

339
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,559
It's time you stop seeing me as your slave.

340
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,799
I had to do paperwork, read books, write reports,

341
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,800
do laundry, cook meals, wash dishes, mop the floor, make the bed.

342
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,800
I'm not your housemaid, Thian!

343
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,440
What the hell was that?

344
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,280
She acts all innocent,

345
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,120
but it turns out she has many secrets.

346
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,079
Are you talking about me?

347
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,200
Whoa!

348
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,040
Hey.

349
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,240
Gossiping is bad.

350
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,320
You might get virus attack again.

351
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,560
What the hell?

352
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,760
Gossiping is bad.

353
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,999
- Get out. - You might get virus attack again.

354
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,680
- Gossiping is bad. - No!

355
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,840
- You might get virus attack again. - Get out!

356
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,960
Admin?

357
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,320
You're the admin?

358
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,760
You're the hacker?

359
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,720
If it's about benefit,

360
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,680
then it has to be Mr. Thada.

361
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,239
What about the love poems sent to Thian then?

362
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,000
What would Yada get out of doing that?

363
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,720
It would only make Thian push her away.

364
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,000
Plus, with the evidence we have,

365
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,760
it's definitely not Yada.

366
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,760
Or could it be someone we overlooked?

367
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,560
That's possible.

368
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,360
What's up, Den? How is it going?

369
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,360
I found the source of the spyware.

370
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,000
Do you know who sent it?

371
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,480
The first batch of virus came from interior team's files

372
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,200
that you asked me to look into.

373
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,440
I ordered you to read, not set them aside.

374
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,960
Finish them all by tomorrow.

375
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,280
I will.

376
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,440
Moei. You can ask me if you don't understand.

377
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,840
I am okay.

378
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,639
I'm totally fine.

379
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,920
Summarize everything and e-mail it to me tonight.

380
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Thank you.

381
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,480
Make sure you don't tell anyone about this yet.

382
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,040
- I'll handle this myself. - Yes, sir.

383
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,960
There's something I don't understand in this part.

384
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,560
Right here.

385
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,000
The blueprint is quite confusing.

386
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,000
Didn't you learn about construction blueprint?

387
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,760
Not really.

388
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,040
That makes sense if you don't understand.

389
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,640
These blueprints are for engineers.

390
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,000
An interior designer like you

391
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,880
don't need to understand them.

392
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,880
I see.

393
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,720
I don't?

394
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,040
Then see here.

395
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,240
Hmm?

396
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,240
F is for foundation.

397
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,920
C is for column.

398
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,000
B is for beam. S is for surface.

399
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,080
ST is for stairs.

400
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,920
Yes.

401
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,480
Study the budget report for now.

402
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,520
I'll teach you how to read a blueprint when I have time.

403
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,440
Thank you.

404
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,680
Don't you like being normal?

405
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,800
Why are you being so abnormal?

406
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,840
How could you propose to a guy.

407
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,920
And hacked his files once he turned you down?

408
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,520
Want some fruits of rejections? I planted tons for you to take bite.

409
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,920
If that's not enough, tell me, I'll provide.

410
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,719
Going through disappointments along the ride.

411
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,280
Maybe in your next life, you'll find one.

412
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,120
You write poems, too?

413
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,800
Of course, I do.

414
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,120
I do when I see dangers.

415
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,800
You might get hurt again.

416
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,079
It doesn't hurt anymore.

417
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,240
If it hurts this much,

418
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,120
- you can stay here tonight? - What?

419
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,120
You write poems, too?

420
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,560
Of course, I do.

421
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,760
I do when I see dangers.

422
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,320
She looks stupid,

423
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,320
but she's not stupid at all.

424
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,160
Are you free this evening?

425
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,040
How about we go to a movie?

426
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,440
What's with him?

427
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,440
He never asked me out before.

428
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,320
What do you say?

429
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,160
Are you free?

430
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,800
This evening?

431
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
Um-hmm.

432
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,560
I have a meeting with Kob and Kang today.

433
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,080
No, sorry.

434
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,120
You dare turn me down?

435
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,560
Look. An opportunity like this doesn't come around often.

436
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,720
I just want to thank you for all your hard work.

437
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
So don't turn down your boss.

438
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,360
So, you're coming?

439
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,080
Hey, why are you laughing?

440
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
The female lead's father just passed away.

441
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
An ant bit me. It's ticklish.

442
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,400
How could a silly one like this hack my computer?

443
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,440
Gosh, where the heck is she?

444
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,760
Why can't we reach Moei at all?

445
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,199
She has never bailed on us.

446
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,760
Exactly. She's the one who told us to meet here at 7 pm.

447
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,080
I've called her a million times, but she didn't answer.

448
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,320
No replies to my texts either.

449
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,760
The meeting is canceled. Let's reschedule.

450
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,480
Is it work?

451
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Yes.

452
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,960
Turn off your phone.

453
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,040
Mind your manners.

454
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,400
All right.

455
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,480
Excuse me, could you turn off your phone?

456
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,400
I'm sorry.

457
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,959
- Hey you. You hit my head. - I'm sorry.

458
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,760
You're blocking the screen. Please sit.

459
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,880
I'm sorry.

460
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,640
Whoa!

461
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,240
I'm sorry.

462
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,320
I'm really sorry.

463
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,280
I'm sorry.

464
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Thian,

465
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,280
thank you so much for treating me to a movie.

466
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,760
Whoa!

467
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,960
Moei.

468
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Moei.

469
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,720
Are you all right?

470
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,960
I'm all right.

471
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,440
How can you be all right?

472
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,560
Come on. Let me help you.

473
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,080
- It's all right, Thian. - Come on.

474
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,560
I can walk by myself.

475
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,200
Thian.

476
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,519
Thian, I can walk by myself.

477
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,920
Thian, let go of me. I said I can walk by myself.

478
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,519
No. You might get hurt again.

479
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,080
It doesn't hurt anymore.

480
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,719
- Is it this ankle? - I'm all right.

481
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,800
- You don't have to do this. - Come on. Stay still.

482
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,880
It hurts, Thian.

483
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,640
See? You're really hurt.

484
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,680
It hurts because you twisted it. Let go.

485
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,000
Thian, it hurts.

486
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,360
If it hurts this much,

487
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,440
- you can stay here tonight. - What?

488
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,480
- Why surprised? - You want me to sleep here?

489
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,840
I don't think it's a good idea.

490
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,920
Why?

491
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,200
I still have to work.

492
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,440
I don't want to turn on the light and disturb you.

493
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,799
I also need to work.

494
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,560
It could be until late.

495
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,880
Me, too.

496
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,720
It could be until the morning...

497
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,240
I'll have to pull an all-nighter, too. I can sleep with lights on, got it?

498
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,280
What the hell is wrong with him?

499
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,680
Why is he getting so clingy to me right now?

500
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,960
Nah, that can't be.

501
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,040
He can't be attracted to me.

502
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,480
Open your mouth.

503
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,040
Open your mouth.

504
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,120
Swallow it. Have you swallowed it?

505
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,840
Yes.

506
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,359
What did you just give me?

507
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,080
It's a painkiller, of course.

508
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,000
Thian, listen. I'm totally fine.

509
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,600
Everything is fine. My ankle also doesn't hurt.

510
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,920
Let me go back to my room.

511
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,200
- Wait. - What is it now?

512
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,240
It seems you don't understand what I said.

513
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,240
The reason you don't want to stay with me,

514
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,080
is it because you hiding something?

515
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,319
That's not it.

516
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,760
Why would I hide something from you?

517
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,680
Good.

518
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,600
Sleep here tonight.

519
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,560
Why am I so sleepy?

520
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,960
No.

521
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,880
I can't sleep now.

522
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,880
I need to find out what he is up to,

523
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,800
letting me sleep in his room.

524
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,200
Sleepy?

525
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,800
Not yet.

526
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,200
Moei.

527
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,880
Moei.

528
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,560
Moei.

529
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,880
Moei.

530
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,680
Moei.

531
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,360
Thian.

532
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,240
You haven't left for work?

533
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,360
I'm waiting for you.

534
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,480
- No, wait. - Let's go.

535
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,080
What are you doing?

536
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,720
- Get in. - Hey.

537
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Tum?

538
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,800
Tum.

539
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,480
Are you sleeping?

540
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,800
No. Say whatever you want to say.

541
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,480
Hey, I'm sleeping in Thian's room tonight!

542
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,840
What?

543
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,560
- Are you serious? - Yes!

544
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,880
Are you really staying with him tonight?

545
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,280
Oh, god. You can't let him get away. Make him yours in his sleep.

546
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,680
Are you crazy?

547
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,280
It's not fun to do it when he's asleep.

548
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,039
You're unbelievable.

549
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,559
What a naughty girl you are.

550
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
- Take this! - Hey!

551
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,680
Oh my gosh.

552
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,680
The phone.

553
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,800
She's incredibly discreet.

554
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,920
No, there must be something.

555
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,680
A sim card?

556
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,040
Matthana.

557
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,720
Mr. Thada's secretary.

558
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,320
So you've really been contacting Mr. Thada behind my back.

559
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,360
Oh.

560
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,440
Did I fall asleep?

561
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,920
How did I suddenly fall asleep?

562
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,000
Could it be...

563
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,720
Oh no.

564
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,360
It's still here.

565
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,040
Maybe I worried too much.

566
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,840
Wait.

567
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,160
What time is it now?

568
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,920
Oh no!

569
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,360
It's half past seven. Holy cow.

570
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,880
I'm super late now. What do I do?

571
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,720
Please come right away. I'm very late now.

572
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,360
Okay. All right.

573
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,600
Okay, bye.

574
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,200
You haven't left for work?

575
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,800
I'm waiting for you.

576
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,640
Waiting for me?

577
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,960
Why are we going together?

578
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,440
- Normally, we never... - Give me that.

579
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,120
What are you doing?

580
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,880
- Get in. - Hey.

581
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,639
Thian, you don't want others to find out about us, do you?

582
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,200
If anyone finds out, we'll be in trouble.

583
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,960
- Thian. - I know that.

584
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,960
I just want to make sure you come to work.

585
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,760
Get out of the car now.

586
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,880
- You nag too much. - Wait.

587
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,200
I'm not even ready.

588
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,400
- Thian. - What is it?

589
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,960
Thian.

590
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,079
You don't have to walk so close.

591
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,800
Don't you see people are looking?

592
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,120
- Let them. - What?

593
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,080
Hey.

594
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,520
Where are my things?

595
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,800
Looking for your things?

596
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,880
Yes.

597
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,520
Did you...

598
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,160
Did you move my things?

599
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,560
- Yes. - What?

600
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,080
Thian.

601
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,920
Where did you move them to?

602
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,520
Over there.

603
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,360
You will be sitting next to me.

604
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,360
Next to you?

605
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,760
Come here.

606
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,399
I got her IG account.

607
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,240
- Damn! - Is it that easy?

608
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,760
Let's see what it is she has to hide.

609
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,960
Hey, Thian.

610
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,640
Do we have to sit this close to each other?

611
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,440
It's good this way.

612
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,040
So I can see what you're doing.

613
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,200
I'll see if you slack off.

614
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,200
Who would dare do that?

615
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,560
- What are you nagging about? - Hmm?

616
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,160
What are you nagging about?

617
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,360
I'm not.

618
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,640
Do your work.

619
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,200
Okay.

620
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,520
Excuse me.

621
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,560
Is that the woman Chad said is married?

622
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,599
Yes.

623
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,120
Why didn't she ask her hubby to drop her here?

624
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,840
I saw it with my own eyes this morning.

625
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,360
Gosh.

626
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,080
She was in Thian's car.

627
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,240
Be she got off right outside the company.

628
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,840
I guess she doesn't want to be spotted.

629
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,000
Is it true?

630
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,399
Of course, it's true.

631
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,200
I don't want to imagine

632
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,000
what would happen if her husband saw that.

633
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,280
Her husband is sitting right there.

634
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,240
She's so shameless.

635
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,720
This newbie doesn't really know her place.

636
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,000
- This is weird. - Gosh, what's wrong with women?

637
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,719
What the heck is wrong with Thian?

638
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,480
Why did he move Moei's desk next to him?

639
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,360
Exactly. Look.

640
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,080
He's been scolding and ordering her around nonstop.

641
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,199
- Right? - You're asking me?

642
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,760
- Yes. - How would I know?

643
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,000
Just go ask him yourself.

644
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,359
There you go again.

645
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,159
How many times do I have to tell you not to make this mistake?

646
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,360
- It's wrong from the start. - I'm sorry.

647
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,160
I have a meeting now. Get it done before I'm back.

648
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Yes.

649
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,880
Here. Read this one, too.

650
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,520
Yes.

651
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,320
What's wrong with him?

652
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,840
I think

653
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,480
we need to teach him a lesson.

654
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,040
Shall we?

655
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,640
- Sure. - Let's do it.

656
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,199
- Come here, you brat. - What're you doing?

657
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,119
You're under arrested for keeping secrets from your friends.

658
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,680
- You need to be questioned. - Yes.

659
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,880
- Let go. This is not funny. - I won't.

660
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,359
- Let go. - I won't.

661
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,720
- I won't let go. - We're not being funny here.

662
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,440
What is your problem?

663
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,600
Whoa!

664
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,279
What's with you? Hold him tightly.

665
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,400
- We are, don't you see? - Yes.

666
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,560
- Hey! - Whoa!

667
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,839
You said you didn't want others to know about you and Moei.

668
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,600
Why did you move her seat next to you?

669
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,840
- Why? - Whoa!

670
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,400
Normally, you don't want to be close to her.

671
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,960
Do you know the people are talking badly about her?

672
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,199
Now you're bullying her.

673
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,159
Yes. She looks totally intimidated now.

674
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,080
- He's right. - You stay out of this.

675
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,280
What?

676
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,520
Hey, don't you dare.

677
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,079
Anyway, she's a woman.

678
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,600
She's so delicate.

679
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,479
You're coming at me because you know nothing.

680
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,560
She is sneaky.

681
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,840
- Hmm? - What?

682
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,600
I need to watch her closely, so she won't go off track.

683
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,160
What I'm doing right now can't be compared

684
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,200
to what she did to me.

685
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,400
What did she do to you?

686
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,440
What? Moei is the hacker?

687
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
Yes.

688
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,600
No way.

689
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,040
This can't be true.

690
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,680
But...

691
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,960
Thian.

692
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,280
Anyone can write poems like these.

693
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,240
You can't accuse her based on such assumption.

694
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,520
He's right.

695
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,480
I believe you if you say she's the admin of A Love to Share.

696
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,160
But it's impossible for her to be the hacker.

697
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,239
You said anyone can write this kind of poem.

698
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,240
- Yes. - Yes.

699
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,279
Okay, Beer.

700
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,600
You go first. Try it.

701
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,839
- Go ahead, man. - Show me.

702
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,680
-Go for it, Beer. - Of course, it's a piece of cake.

703
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,800
Easy-peasy.

704
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,120
One, two, three.

705
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,559
A for apple, B for ball, C for cat.

706
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,119
I came to ask for your love. Why are you so mean to me?

707
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,919
You unfriended me. You made me love you then broke my heart.

708
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,039
Hey, wait.

709
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,200
- So can you do it? - Not really, sir.

710
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I'm sorry.

711
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,320
- That was good. - All right.

712
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,440
What about you two?

713
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,479
No problem. Let's go, Nott.

714
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,599
- Please. - You. Sit.

715
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,680
All right, sir.

716
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,120
Nott, let's show them.

717
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,720
Love starts with the letter L,

718
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,920
It then sails further to form the O,

719
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,680
Then the V and E complete the show,

720
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,360
Then I know it's the word "I love you."

721
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,440
- I love you. - Hey, wait.

722
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,240
So, you can make one.

723
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,440
- Yes. - It just happened.

724
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,720
See? I told you that it's hard.

725
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,080
- All right. - That's why I have to keep an eye on her.

726
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
Look.

727
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,320
The first batch of virus came from the interior team's files.

728
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,440
- What? - What?

729
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,680
I ordered you to read them, not put them away.

730
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,000
- Finish them all by tomorrow. - I will.

731
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,320
Summarize everything and e-mail it to me tonight.

732
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,720
It's a type of spyware called Keylocker

733
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,400
which was sent to your inbox.

734
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,599
When you clicked on it,

735
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,160
the program started running.

736
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,280
Everything you typed in

737
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,400
was sent to the hacker.

738
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,080
Is Moei really the hacker?

739
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,159
Maybe her computer might've caught a virus

740
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,919
- and accidentally attached to the files she sent you. - Yeah.

741
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,159
It might be a coincidence.

742
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,520
It's not a coincidence.

743
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,960
I found her chat with Matthana, Mr. Thada's secretary.

744
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,720
- What? - What?

745
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,999
Are you saying that Moei

746
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,879
was stealing information for Mr. Thada?

747
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,320
This is way too crazy.

748
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,600
This can't be true.

749
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,600
Anyway, based on what you told us,

750
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,560
we can't say she's the hacker.

751
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,400
If we want to tie her down completely,

752
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,480
we need more evidence.

753
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,400
But if what you're saying is true,

754
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,120
why would she do this?

755
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,520
Yeah.

756
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,600
Do you remember when TW copied my work?

757
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,640
- Yes. - Yes.

758
01:00:37,641 --> 01:00:40,360
Mr. Thada is a shareholder in that company.

759
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,039
I think Moei made a deal with him not to dissolve Hammoc.

760
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,559
Wow. How could you come up with this?

761
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,640
Exactly.

762
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,800
Moei never cracked a thing.

763
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,720
- So quiet as a mouse. - What's wrong with you?

764
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,360
Wait.

765
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,720
You have known her for years.

766
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,120
Can you think carefully

767
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,800
about what you know about her?

768
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,400
Think carefully. Anything?

769
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,159
- I don't know. - Hey.

770
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,480
That's it.

771
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,879
You're always like this.

772
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,759
You never care about those around you.

773
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,280
That's why she played you.

774
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,960
- Whoa. - Whoa.

775
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,280
That's harsh.

776
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,720
I got an idea.

777
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,040
If you can't get information from Moei,

778
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,840
why don't get it from someone else?

779
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,720
- From who? - Yeah, who?

780
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,920
From what I know about Mr. Thada's secretary,

781
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,640
she's his right hand.

782
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,960
She's clever and smart.

783
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,239
Since she's working for him,

784
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,200
she should know every aspect about this.

785
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,360
If they hacked us,

786
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,400
then we should hack them.

787
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,520
Why can't I log in to my IG account?

788
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,760
I got her IG account.

789
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,560
- Damn! - Is it that easy?

790
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,720
Of course.

791
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,320
Why do you think celebrities got hacked often?

792
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,440
- You're right. - Yes.

793
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,600
Let's see what it is she has to hide.

794
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,679
Jeez, Nott. That is nonsense.

795
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,559
What's the use looking into her secrets?

796
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,600
Hey.

797
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,320
- We can blackmail her. - Yes.

798
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,760
Use it as leverage to get the information we want.

799
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,800
Blackmail?

800
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,200
Blackmail?

801
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,560
You're right. Blackmail.

802
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,399
- You're really smart. - Of course I am.

803
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,360
But how are you going to do that?

804
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,920
The direct messages.

805
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,080
Check it out.

806
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,479
Gosh. You're awesome, Thian.

807
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,680
Where is it?

808
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,560
There's nothing but messages in her IG stories.

809
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,360
Hold on, can we look at that one?

810
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,160
- This one? - Yes.

811
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:13,160
"Hello, I'm Aof. I followed you from the group."

812
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,480
What group?

813
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,520
"Please send me your photo."

814
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,920
- Whoa. - Whoa.

815
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,240
- Hey. - Beer.

816
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,360
Why does he look exactly like you?

817
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,560
- Like me? - Yes, come check.

818
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,000
Are you crazy? How can I be on that? Whoa!

819
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,240
- Are those your abs, really? - That's really me.

820
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,480
But that's not me.

821
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,840
- That's not my body. - But that's your face.

822
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,440
Oh, yeah. That looks good.

823
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,560
- So, is it you? - No freaking way!

824
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,440
Man, it's creepy.

825
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,560
"Okay.

826
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,360
See you tomorrow at W Condo

827
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,560
at 9.30 pm."

828
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,440
Seriously?

829
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,160
Did she just hook up with a man through direct messages?

830
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,000
How about we reach her like this Aof guy?

831
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,000
- Yeah. - So...

832
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,080
who should text her?

833
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,280
Me?

834
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,520
- Since you look like him. - You're kidding, right?

835
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,560
Not a bit.

836
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,520
Can someone else do it?

837
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,160
(You have 1 new message.)

838
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,240
I'm Boy. I followed you from the group.

839
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,840
Please send me your photo.

840
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,160
It was just getting bored.

841
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,240
See you tomorrow at W Condo at 9:30 pm.

842
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,040
That's creepy.

843
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,480
Yeah.

844
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,920
Alright!

845
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,399
She got hooked easier than I thought.

846
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,400
She did?

847
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,280
Are you Boy?

848
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,680
Yes, I am.

849
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,560
Does this mean

850
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,320
I have to sacrifice myself for you all?

851
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,080
Just get the intel and leave before it happens.

852
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,239
Come on, Thian. What if she doesn't want to hook up with me?

853
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,159
What if she's a serial killer who wants to slice me into pieces?

854
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,520
I'll be so dead. What would my parents say about this?

855
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,680
Me into pieces.

856
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,800
I'm gonna be dead.

857
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,520
Come on. We won't let you die.

858
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,720
- Promise? - Yes.

859
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,280
You're our hope.

860
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,240
For TPC.

861
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,680
Okay.

862
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,480
Let's do this for TPC!

863
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,880
I'll drop you off here.

864
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,600
Come on, don't be scared.

865
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,920
We'll be around here.

866
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:02,999
Right.

867
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,520
Go for it! Get us the information.

868
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,160
Good luck.

869
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,120
The elevator.

870
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,040
In front of the elevator, in the lobby.

871
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,080
Well, it's right here.

872
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,680
In the lobby, in front of the elevator.

873
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,320
Are you Boy?

874
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,760
Yes, I am.

875
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,680
This way, please.

876
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:22,960
The room on the left.

877
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,480
The room on the left?

878
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,520
Whoa.

879
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,600
Oh, man.

880
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,640
This is so Fifty Shades of Grey.

881
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,840
What the hell?

882
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,080
What are you doing?

883
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,160
Aren't we in the same group?

884
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,200
You should know what I want.

885
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,600
- Strip. - Please don't do it!

886
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,760
I beg you. I'm scared now.

887
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,839
I said strip!

888
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,080
Strip!

889
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,320
Why is he so quiet?

890
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:58,960
Maybe he's having a great time with Matthana.

891
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,160
I don't want to imagine it.

892
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,520
Oh, nice.

893
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,719
I'm leaving now. Goodbye.

894
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,320
Stop right there!

895
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,720
What's it?

896
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,440
Whip me.

897
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,880
What are you doing?

898
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,120
I'm whipping you.

899
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,240
Can't you do it properly?

900
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,399
Okay, I will.

901
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,880
Whip me!

902
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,040
Thrash me!

903
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,080
Harder!

904
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,520
Get it!

905
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,360
That sounds like a Chinese martial arts movie.

906
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,000
Are they on zip lines right now?

907
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,520
Gosh, Beer.

908
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,680
- Why are you slapping me? - Put it on.

909
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,840
What?

910
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,800
Shut up.

911
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,039
I said shut up.

912
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,160
Shut up.

913
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,880
You won't shut up, huh?

914
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,200
Go wait outside.

915
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,600
Damn it.

916
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,200
(Natheerin Contract. doc)

917
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,120
"Natheerin Contract."

918
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,200
Isn't that Moei's name?

919
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,880
- Here is your pay. - Oh no.

920
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,080
Thank you.

921
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,040
Hang on.

922
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,999
What's in your other hand?

923
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,320
- It's nothing. - Let me see.

924
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,600
So?

925
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,720
The hacker girl.

926
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,799
What's in your other hand?

927
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,320
- It's nothing. - Let me see.

928
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,920
You can leave now.

929
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,640
Okay.

930
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,800
Yes, Sir.

931
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,960
I wonder how he is doing.

932
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,520
Call him.

933
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,680
Hey, don't. There he comes.

934
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,360
- Oh, there he is. - Hey.

935
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,680
Oh, man.

936
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,840
- What's this? - Oh, man.

937
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,640
Whoa, whoa.

938
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,999
- What are you saying? - Wait.

939
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,240
What's wrong with you?

940
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,000
-You spit on me. - You bastards.

941
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,879
Do you know what group Matthana is in?

942
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,600
- What is it? - It's a sadist and masochist group.

943
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,799
- Oh, god. - Don't tell me...

944
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,440
Yes, Matthana is a masochist.

945
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,920
She loves violence.

946
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,039
She's happy when she gets harmed violently.

947
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,320
She's also a sadist. She whipped my back and butt.

948
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,160
Hey, wait. Did you get anything?

949
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,439
After what I told you,

950
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,360
don't you care about my pain at all?

951
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,800
You still look... Leave me alone!

952
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,560
You're still intact. What's with the nag?

953
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,280
So? Did you get it?

954
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,320
Here you go.

955
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,720
It is a contract between Moei and Mr. Thada.

956
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,360
Mr. Thada and Moei made a deal

957
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,119
that if she could get the information of TPC,

958
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,400
he and the main shareholders

959
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,920
would vote against the dissolution of Hammoc.

960
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,960
But there is also a special agreement.

961
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,760
What's it?

962
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,920
Thian,

963
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,520
it says he has to stop Yada from messing with you again.

964
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,640
That's why Yada wasn't around these days.

965
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,760
Moei is really something. I respect her for that.

966
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,080
You're such lucky man having a girl helping you.

967
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,160
Right?

968
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,880
- Did I say something wrong? - You said nothing wrong.

969
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,240
- Right? - What you said was right.

970
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,200
Thian is just not okay with that.

971
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,440
Because that girl is Moei.

972
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,320
The one he never thought of.

973
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,760
Did I mishear it?

974
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,680
You want to know about Moei?

975
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,160
You heard it right.

976
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,640
Since I'm married to her,

977
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,120
and I'll be living with her for a long time,

978
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,040
I should know more about her.

979
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,440
Because right now, she is not someone I thought I knew.

980
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,520
Moei was very good at her studies.

981
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,400
With her high school grades, she could have studied medicine.

982
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,600
But she shifted to interior designing.

983
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,200
She's the best when it comes to computer and math.

984
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,240
Hey, do you know

985
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,680
that once she won the Capture the Flag contest?

986
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,640
Thian.

987
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,120
Don't forget to change your password

988
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,600
or you might get hacked again.

989
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,520
Why does she have to hide this from me?

990
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,920
What are you talking about?

991
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,880
She never kept this a secret.

992
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,400
It's just you that never paid attention to her.

993
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,560
I don't know what's going on between you two,

994
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,320
but I want you to calm down

995
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,280
and talk to her with reason.

996
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,120
I will give you a chance.

997
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,560
Tell me the truth.

998
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,120
Tell you the truth?

999
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,360
About what?

1000
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,840
So?

1001
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,840
The hacker girl.

1002
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,920
Why do you look pale? Because I know the truth?

1003
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,200
Well,

1004
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,960
I'm turning pale,

1005
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,040
because I'm afraid of heights.

1006
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,560
I'm not the hacker like you think.

1007
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,120
You know I'm a stupid one.

1008
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,799
How can I be one?

1009
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,080
Stop being tight-lipped.

1010
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,160
I can see through you down to your appendix.

1011
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,759
But I have it removed long ago.

1012
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,159
- Are you working me up? - I'm telling you the truth.

1013
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,799
I know you're working with Thada stealing information

1014
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,240
from me so you can save Hammoc.

1015
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,880
I never thought you'd be this selfish!

1016
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,080
Hey.

1017
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,640
Admit you did it.

1018
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,600
And I'll help you.

1019
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,240
Can't you help me first?

1020
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,080
No, Thian.

1021
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,920
Moei.

1022
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,480
Moei!

1023
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,720
Are you all right?

1024
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,080
- Get up slowly. - I'm all right.

1025
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,400
Someone who we thought we know our whole life

1026
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,119
might turn out to be someone we didn't know at all.

1027
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,200
I'll make you realize you've made a bad choice

1028
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,880
to go against someone like me.

1029
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,960
Thank you.

1030
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,840
What is it?

1031
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,480
Thank you so much.

1032
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,320
Let's have a meeting this afternoon.

1033
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,600
The staff we sent over has informed me

1034
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,399
there are many problems there.

1035
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,840
We need to discuss how to solve them.

1036
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,400
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1037
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,639
Another meeting in the afternoon?

1038
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,679
- Yeah, too many. - Again?

1039
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,600
We have only meetings all days.

1040
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,319
I don't get to work at all.

1041
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,920
- Yes, and also that. - Hey.

1042
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,320
- What is it? - It's Moei.

1043
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,440
Oh.

1044
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,160
Oh. It's really Moei.

1045
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,799
Thian, can you not be so harsh on her?

1046
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,400
She is almost at her limit.

1047
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,360
Why did you give her so much to read?

1048
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,119
That is far from enough.

1049
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:12,679
Come on. Can't you take pity on her?

1050
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,720
Right.

1051
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,840
You know very well what she did to me.

1052
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,960
I'll be even harsher.

1053
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,000
Wait and see.

1054
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,080
Moei, come to our department right now.

1055
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,400
What?

1056
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,000
"Clearing and Grubbing Team, Dawei Project"?

1057
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,400
Hey, why is...

1058
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,639
Mookda Phafandee there?

1059
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,160
Why is my name there?

1060
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,000
Well, my name is there, too.

1061
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,520
- That's true. - Look at the names to be sent to Myanmar.

1062
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,920
You, Kang, Tum.

1063
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,840
It's everyone under Hammoc.

1064
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,480
What is it?

1065
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,879
Hey, I think Thian is getting suspicious,

1066
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,400
or else he wouldn't do this.

1067
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,160
- Right? - Yes.

1068
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,400
But from what I see,

1069
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,640
I don't think he knows who did it.

1070
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,720
But we have to be more careful now.

1071
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,640
It's you who should be the most careful, Moei.

1072
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,600
What we did not only affects TecTien,

1073
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,200
but the whole TPC.

1074
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,520
Therefore, we have to be careful.

1075
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,320
We will, don't worry.

1076
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,920
Is Thian trying to pressure Hammoc's staff

1077
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,760
to find out who the hacker is,

1078
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,480
or does he actually want to send me away?

1079
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,560
What we did not only affects TecTien,

1080
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,800
but the whole TPC.

1081
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,600
Moei, you have to be careful.

1082
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,920
Just focus on that for now. Don't worry about the rest.

1083
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:06,960
Yes, sir.

1084
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,599
- Den. - Yes?

1085
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,719
How is it going with the IP address tracking?

1086
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,359
Next in line are the computers from Hammoc Department.

1087
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,400
I see.

1088
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,959
Thian is about to check the computers of Hammoc staff.

1089
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,360
Delete all evidence and stop everything for now.

1090
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,600
We have to observe the situation for a while.

1091
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,760
Don't worry. We'll find the hacker soon.

1092
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:08,880
Good.

1093
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,200
Because I hate traitors the most.

1094
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,680
I will make sure to get rid of them all.

1095
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,960
He must have found out that it's me.

1096
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,600
But why didn't he ask me directly?

1097
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,040
What is he thinking?

1098
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,000
You can sit next to my wife.

1099
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,760
I don't believe you.

1100
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,040
I don't think you would do nothing about this.

1101
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,599
Why hasn't Natheerin sent over the information?

1102
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,880
She says Thiarawat is keeping an eye on her now.

1103
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,759
So she needs to hold off the operation.

1104
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,240
She doesn't want Thiarawat to find out about you.

1105
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,960
Jeez! How long will I have to wait?

1106
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,560
Ms. Natheerin says she'll need to wait for the right time

1107
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,800
and will contact me again.

1108
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,240
You can leave now.

1109
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,840
Ms. Yada.

1110
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,639
What are you plotting with that girl?

1111
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,880
It's none of your business.

1112
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,239
But if you don't tell me,

1113
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,520
I'll tell Thian everything.

1114
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,400
That girl sold TPC's secrets to you,

1115
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,199
saying that she didn't love Thian

1116
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,000
and that she married him because of me?

1117
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,240
Yes.

1118
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,160
That is not true, Dad.

1119
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,360
She was the one who told me that she loved Thian.

1120
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,959
You can't trust her.

1121
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,640
But I believe her because she has proven to me

1122
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,240
that she doesn't care about her husband at all.

1123
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,760
So? Did you have a good time?

1124
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,520
Yes, it was great.

1125
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,760
Really?

1126
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,040
How about stay here tonight?

1127
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,480
Are you sure?

1128
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,600
Yes.

1129
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,400
Is that your wife?

1130
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,080
Yes, that's my wife.

1131
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,840
Well, since you're here, I'll introduce you to her.

1132
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,760
Come on. Don't be shy.

1133
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:40,200
Hi, sweetheart. Are you about to have dinner?

1134
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,680
Bee and I are hungry too.

1135
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,280
You can sit next to my wife. Come on.

1136
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,400
- Are you sure? - Yes, it's all right.

1137
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,920
Take a seat.

1138
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,280
Is anyone there? Give me two sets of plates and utensils.

1139
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,720
I'll get them for you.

1140
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,120
What are you trying to do?

1141
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,440
What do you mean?

1142
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,560
Normally, you never stayed calm

1143
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,880
when you saw me with a woman at home like this.

1144
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:33,080
Tell me what you're trying to do.

1145
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,960
I'm not trying to do anything.

1146
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,200
I'm just tired.

1147
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,800
And I don't want to fight with you anymore.

1148
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,120
I don't believe you.

1149
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,040
I don't think you would do nothing about this.

1150
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,240
Just believe all you want.

1151
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,760
Time will tell.

1152
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,400
Never mind.

1153
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,240
I'll do it.

1154
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,360
Just help me clean it up.

1155
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,480
Yes, ma'am.

1156
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,680
Bee, have this one.

1157
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,640
This is so good. I'll get it for you.

1158
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,760
Give me your plate.

1159
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,200
Come on.

1160
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,520
Here you go. Eat up. Make yourself at home.

1161
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:55,480
Here is my suggestion on filing for divorce against your husband.

1162
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,840
You have to secretly install CCTV cameras in your house.

1163
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,320
So you can expose the bad behaviors of your husband.

1164
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,840
The judge will see you as a hopeless victim.

1165
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,880
I'm confident that this will help you win the case.

1166
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:15,440
And you'll be able to claim millions in alimony.

1167
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,080
I'd like to thank you

1168
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,160
for complying with my plan.

1169
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,760
Yada must now believe that you and Moei are a real couple.

1170
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,080
That's why she won't mess with you anymore.

1171
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,720
I hope that's the case.

1172
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,200
It won't be long

1173
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,040
until Mr. Thada withdraws his shares from our company.

1174
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,760
We don't know that.

1175
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,800
He might be doing something behind our back.

1176
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,800
By the way, have you found the one who is working with Mr. Thada?

1177
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,240
I'm still not sure about this.

1178
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,840
I would like to investigate further

1179
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,560
and I will punish the culprit once I find out.

1180
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,800
Pack your things

1181
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,280
and follow me.

1182
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,120
- What? - Don't ask.

1183
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:46,280
Just do it.

1184
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,320
Why still sitting?

1185
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,520
On a count of three, if you don't follow me.

1186
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,800
- One... - Whoa, wait.

1187
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,039
Stop counting.

1188
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,560
I'm coming now.

1189
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,720
Why did he bring me here?

1190
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,920
I hope he's not planning to kill me here

1191
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,080
and cover my body with cement.

1192
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,760
Follow me and take notes.

1193
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,000
If I don't take a rest, you don't either. Got it?

1194
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,520
Yes.

1195
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,720
Then follow me.

1196
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,160
Okay.

1197
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,840
Moei.

1198
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,000
Coming.

1199
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,760
It's based on this blueprint, right?

1200
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,760
Yes, we were talking about the part up there.

1201
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,080
- Let's take a look over there. - Sure. This way, please.

1202
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,520
You can get back to work. Please take care of it.

1203
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,120
- Yes. - Thank you.

1204
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,360
Let's leave.

1205
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,960
Hey, hurry up.

1206
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,680
I said hurry up.

1207
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,240
Moei!

1208
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,200
You all should warn her

1209
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,199
not to cause many scandals.

1210
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,879
She's already married.

1211
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,520
Why still going after another man?

1212
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,640
I said hurry up.

1213
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,240
Moei!

1214
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:00,840
Don't worry.

1215
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,920
Ms. Natheerin passed out because she was in the sun for too long.

1216
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,360
- Thank you. - All right.

1217
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,199
Can you tell me the price of this item?

1218
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,400
Sure. This one, right?

1219
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,119
- Hey! What the heck? - Stop it!

1220
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,759
- Are you out of your mind? - You should ask your friend that.

1221
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,840
She likes to mess with someone else's man.

1222
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,400
What do you mean?

1223
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,320
Everyone was talking.

1224
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:52,600
Natheerin pretended to pass out at the construction site.

1225
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,720
TecTien had to carry her out.

1226
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:57,560
You all should warn her

1227
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,440
not to cause too many scandals.

1228
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,240
She's already married.

1229
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,920
Why still going after another man?

1230
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,720
Tell your friend to know her place,

1231
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,720
and tell her who comes first.

1232
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:42,000
Why am I here?

1233
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,680
You passed out.

1234
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,760
Were you the one

1235
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,960
who brought me here?

1236
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,160
That's right. And you know what?

1237
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,600
You're so heavy that I nearly broke my arms.

1238
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,520
Oh, my.

1239
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,960
I'm sorry.

1240
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:10,160
So, how's everything at the site?

1241
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,640
- Hey. - Let's go back there.

1242
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,960
You don't. Just lie down.

1243
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,240
- But I'm okay now. - I said no.

1244
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:21,760
Just take a rest.

1245
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,800
You're weak. I thought you were strong.

1246
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:31,640
Can you give me an inhaler?

1247
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,400
I'm feeling dizzy.

1248
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,600
Just a minute.

1249
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:44,720
Excuse me.

1250
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:47,640
Excuse me. Do you have an inhaler?

1251
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:56,440
Moei.

1252
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,360
Kob.

1253
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,240
I heard you passed out at the site.

1254
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,280
How are you doing?

1255
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,920
I'm all right now.

1256
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,840
Where is Thiarawat?

1257
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,760
I need to talk to him.

1258
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,600
I won't let him make you work this hard again.

1259
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,240
I'm here.

1260
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,680
Say what you want to say.

1261
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:29,600
You're pushing her beyond her scope of work.

1262
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,000
Her duty doesn't require her at the construction sites.

1263
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,960
I just want to get her prepared for Dawei.

1264
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,480
That's all.

1265
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,240
Then you should inform everyone about it.

1266
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,560
Not taking her everywhere like this.

1267
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,400
They are all talking

1268
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,240
that you're in a relationship with her.

1269
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,000
I can't inform everyone about that

1270
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,400
because I can't control what they think.

1271
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:00,080
Thiarawat, you should learn to be a gentleman,

1272
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,480
especially with your female subordinate.

1273
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,680
Moei.

1274
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:09,760
Tell him you're all right.

1275
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,320
Kob,

1276
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,200
Thian is right.

1277
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,800
We can't control what they think.

1278
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:24,040
It's enough for us to know we're not like what they think we are.

1279
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,360
Moei.

1280
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,480
You don't have to do what he says.

1281
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,560
Kob.

1282
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,480
I'm begging you.

1283
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,040
Don't you have work to do?

1284
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,640
Why don't you get back to work?

1285
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,880
Just go back to work when you're recovered.

1286
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:56,320
By the way, you need to get your fitness prepared.

1287
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,240
Things are harsher in Dawei.

1288
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,160
- Hurry up. - Yes.

1289
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:23,680
Moei. Didn't you just come out of the hospital?

1290
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,720
Why are you here? Why don't you rest?

1291
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,039
He's making you, right?

1292
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,480
- Tell me. I'll deal with him. - Hey.

1293
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:34,360
Well, I feel so much better now.

1294
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,960
Thank you so much for your concern.

1295
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:38,880
Okay.

1296
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:41,920
Get back to work.

1297
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:43,520
Yes.

1298
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,920
- Get it done. - I will.

1299
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,919
- Let's go. - Yes, let's.

1300
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,720
- Okay, let's go. - All right.

1301
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:20,560
We'll build the building facing the direction of the wind.

1302
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:23,600
So the wind can flow through and help save the energy.

1303
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,760
As for the roof structure, we'll use metal,

1304
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,840
which we'll install solar cells, so it can get solar energy.

1305
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,400
Thian, there's a letter for you.

1306
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,840
Hey, is it from Moei?

1307
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,440
Let me see.

1308
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,160
I thank you for the fruits of rejections.

1309
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,120
The taste was so great, I can't wait for more.

1310
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:53,320
What you gave was way too little, though.

1311
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,840
Ten rais was nothing to my stomach as it still growls.

1312
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,640
That's why I should keep going after you.

1313
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,920
Do you think a hundred more rais of those fruits would do?

1314
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,200
Meanwhile, I'm growing the tree of love,

1315
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:09,480
waiting for you to ask for my hand.

1316
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,560
Don't ever think I'll give up on you easily.

1317
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,520
I will never retreat unless I die.

1318
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:18,480
I'll keep wooing you every single day.

1319
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:21,680
Until you give me your heart with a smile.

1320
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:24,720
You could put the blame on destiny.

1321
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:27,840
That keeps me attracted only to you so strongly.

1322
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:31,160
I will eat the fruits of rejection and wait for you.

1323
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,720
Even though hopelessness is all I can see.

1324
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,440
If I keep waiting for you to next life,

1325
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:41,520
Can you promise you will love me?

1326
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:45,160
Even though I will eventually give in to nature,

1327
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:49,360
my love will be there for you to the end.

1328
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,600
Wow.

1329
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,240
Moei is trying to flirt with you through poems

1330
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,360
and make us believe that it's Yada.

1331
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,640
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1332
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,359
Attention, I am having an urgent sick leave

1333
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,800
due to eating too much fruit of rejection,

1334
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:07,920
which also affected my heart.

1335
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:11,159
Therefore, I'll stop courting you for three days.

1336
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,360
Do you already want to surrender?

1337
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:15,360
You're such an amateur.

1338
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,480
My opponent is suffering a setback.

1339
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:25,920
Should I step up my game now?

1340
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,480
Hello?

1341
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,080
Thian.

1342
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,080
It's all fine with me.

1343
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,120
Just tell me when and where.

1344
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,360
How about we...

1345
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,520
try dating for real?

1346
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,000
You shameless woman.

1347
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,320
You stole my man.

1348
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:29,280
- Get out of our lives. - No way.

1349
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,080
I don't believe you.

1350
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,240
You see? You're so pathetic.

1351
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:41,840
The hacker risked going ahead knowing we might be watching.

1352
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:43,880
They must be under pressure, too.

1353
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,320
The whole office is being hacked!

1354
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:48,800
How could it happen all at once?
