1
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,760
How about we...

2
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,080
try dating for real?

3
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,960
You shameless! What a thief!

4
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,920
Get out of our lives.

5
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

6
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,720
I don't believe you.

7
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,439
Troublemaker!

8
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,960
You're so pathetic.

9
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,520
The hacker risked going ahead knowing we might be watching.

10
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,600
He must be under pressure, too.

11
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
The whole office is being hacked!

12
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,480
How could it happen all at once?

13
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,760
Damn it!

14
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,400
Kob.

15
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,399
- He won't do anything. - Why won't he?

16
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,640
Because he is my husband.

17
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,040
Go pack your bags.

18
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,960
You're all leaving to Dawei tomorrow.

19
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Moei.

20
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,800
You do realize that that man is Pondej, right?

21
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
Be careful.

22
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,280
This is the person who will become my right hand.

23
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,640
This is the person who will become my right hand.

24
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Moei.

25
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:09,160
Yes? What?

26
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,400
- Are you okay? - I'm just worried that.

27
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,120
Mr. Thada might find out.

28
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Then you'd better hurry.

29
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,640
Stop hovering. Hurry!

30
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,320
Okay.

31
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm done washing my hands.

32
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,600
Ms. Natheerin.

33
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
Can I help you?

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
I'm sure

35
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
we've never met in person.

36
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
But now that I get to meet you,

37
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,600
you look strangely familiar to me.

38
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,920
It's like we've already met somewhere before.

39
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
Here, Sir.

40
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Moei.

41
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,880
Have you met Pondej before?

42
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,200
No.

43
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
We've never met before.

44
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,440
Well, if you say so,

45
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,200
I guess we really haven't met.

46
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,720
Well then, it's very nice to meet you.

47
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a pleasure to be working with you.

48
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,640
The pleasure is mine.

49
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,439
Very well. If you're ready, please go ahead.

50
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,160
Mr. Thada and other executives

51
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,320
are waiting to have lunch with you.

52
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
- Sure. - Please.

53
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,280
Where are Mr. Thada and other executives?

54
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,000
They're probably headed to the restaurant.

55
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,080
Looks like you'll have to ride with me.

56
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
Please.

57
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,760
Moei.

58
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,360
Don't get in the car.

59
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,720
Tell him you drove here.

60
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,600
Mr. Pondej.

61
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,879
I won't bother you.

62
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,720
I brought my car.

63
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,840
It's more convenient to ride with me.

64
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,480
You won't have to drive back and forth.

65
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,680
Thian, what should I do?

66
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Don't worry. I'll follow you.

67
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,680
What do you say?

68
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,640
All right then.

69
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,960
Please.

70
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,480
May I search you before you get in?

71
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,640
What?

72
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,560
Don't be rude.

73
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,399
You're scaring her.

74
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,680
- But... - I said no need to do that.

75
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,920
Yes, Sir.

76
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm sure you don't carry a weapon

77
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,000
to use against me, right?

78
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,520
Of course not.

79
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,000
Please get in.

80
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,239
Keep an eye on Natheerin.

81
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,840
See if she's acting suspiciously.

82
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,800
Nothing is suspicious so far.

83
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Moei.

84
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,360
I'll take another route.

85
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,240
I don't want them to suspect I'm tailing them.

86
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,920
Send me your location.

87
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,240
Forgive me for asking you this, Ms. Natheerin.

88
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
Does your husband really not know

89
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,560
that you're working for us?

90
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,239
I'm just curious.

91
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,120
You know my wife can never keep anything from me.

92
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,000
So I think it might have been a mistake

93
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,640
for my father-in-law to hire you to work for us.

94
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,960
Hey, Moei.

95
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Moei.

96
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,880
I must be out of range.

97
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,400
Don't you trust me, Mr. Pondej?

98
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,239
A guy like you probably thinks you can control women.

99
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,720
I hate to break it to you,

100
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
but I'm not like those women.

101
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,000
Guys like to think they have their girlfriends figured out.

102
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
Little do they know

103
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,440
that women can see through men as well.

104
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,440
I can assure you my husband has no idea that

105
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,760
I'm working for Mr. Thada.

106
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,240
Wow.

107
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,880
Thiarawat is such a lucky guy

108
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,680
to have a woman like you as his wife.

109
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Outwardly, you seem like a sweet and harmless woman.

110
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,320
But I'm sure the real you

111
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
are full of surprises.

112
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,720
You can try me.

113
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,760
You'll see for yourself what kind of woman I really am.

114
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,760
This is fun. I love it.

115
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,640
Moei.

116
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,440
Moei.

117
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,040
I'm doing fine.

118
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,160
Hurry and come to this restaurant.

119
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,320
Good afternoon. Welcome.

120
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,160
Moei.

121
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
I'm here.

122
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,000
Get ready.

123
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
There you are.

124
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,600
- Please have a seat. - Hello.

125
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Thank you.

126
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,400
Have a seat.

127
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
All right.

128
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,440
Very well, then.

129
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,600
Without further, let us begin.

130
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,520
This is TPC's big project that we've just acquired.

131
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,080
What do you think? Isn't it incredible?

132
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Moei.

133
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,920
I can't see it. Can you turn to the left?

134
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,960
More to the left.

135
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,320
Turn left. No, that's too far.

136
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,720
Back to the right.

137
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,520
Moei, get me that laptop's IP address.

138
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,799
Don't forget to turn off firewall.

139
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,640
Is he crazy? The laptop is with him.

140
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,360
Will this be the tallest once it's complete?

141
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,400
Excuse me.

142
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,280
I'd like to add something.

143
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,280
This building is not meant to break the height record.

144
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,720
The main focus is its utility

145
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,960
and its earthquake resistant structure.

146
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,240
If you allow me,

147
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,920
I'll show you other buildings in the same category.

148
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,440
Mr. Thada,

149
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,840
can I borrow your laptop?

150
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,000
Of course.

151
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you.

152
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,080
(Wi-Fi successfully connected)

153
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,880
Come on, hurry.

154
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,600
There's IP address.

155
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
Here.

156
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,720
Here are the rankings of the world's tallest buildings in 2019.

157
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,040
How careless.

158
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,920
He kept all files in one place.

159
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,600
He didn't even bother change the filenames.

160
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,160
Excuse me.

161
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,680
Moei.

162
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,800
I'm done here.

163
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,640
I'll head back now.

164
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,720
Now, you have to

165
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,280
find your way out of there.

166
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,240
What? Are you really leaving me?

167
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Thian.

168
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,600
All right. I think we should leave it for now.

169
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,120
Let's have some refreshments.

170
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,840
You are really lucky

171
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,840
to have a competent employee like Ms. Natheerin.

172
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,920
Thank you, Sir.

173
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,280
I promise I'll do my best.

174
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Would you excuse us then?

175
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,520
- Sure. - Of course.

176
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,040
- Have a good day. - You too.

177
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,360
Then, please excuse me as well.

178
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,760
Wait, Ms. Natheerin.

179
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,360
Don't you want a ride back?

180
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,080
Oh. That's all right.

181
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,880
I have something to take care of nearby.

182
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,480
Please excuse me.

183
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,000
Goodbye.

184
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,640
Goodbye.

185
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,560
What do you think of her?

186
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,680
That I don't know yet.

187
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,800
All I know is now

188
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,000
she really has me intrigued.

189
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,880
I made it.

190
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,000
I thought I'd die in there.

191
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Thian.

192
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,800
Thian.

193
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,320
Thian.

194
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,960
Thian.

195
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,840
Thian!

196
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,080
Gosh, Thian.

197
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
What a jerk you are.

198
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,400
I can't believe this.

199
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,360
He doesn't care about me at all.

200
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,840
I guess it's true

201
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,480
they say good looking guys are all jerks.

202
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,720
It's 10 baht.

203
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,800
That's five.

204
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,120
Six, seven, eight, nine.

205
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Can my day get any worse?

206
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,720
I'm only one baht short.

207
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,320
Hey.

208
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,600
Where did that come from?

209
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,400
The sky?

210
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,080
Could it be god sent it?

211
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,240
Thank you so much.

212
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,000
Now, I believe that you're real.

213
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,040
I've got my 10 baht now.

214
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,840
Hey!

215
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,560
You're back.

216
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,720
Cook me something. I'm hungry.

217
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,960
Gosh!

218
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,160
Thian.

219
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Won't you ask me

220
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,040
how I got out of there?

221
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,680
Don't you want to know whether I'm all right?

222
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,800
How could you leave me in such a dangerous place?

223
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,240
I can't believe this. He doesn't care about me at all.

224
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,920
I guess it's true

225
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,560
they say that good looking guys are all jerks.

226
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm so thirsty.

227
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,640
It's 10 baht.

228
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,520
Can my day get any worse?

229
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,680
I'm only one baht short.

230
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,560
Could it be...

231
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
God sent it?

232
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,680
Thank you so much.

233
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,120
Now, I believe that you're real.

234
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,000
Well.

235
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,440
You seem fine.

236
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,040
Thian.

237
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,080
I know I did a bad thing

238
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,880
and now I'm trying to make amends.

239
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,760
But at least I'm…

240
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,480
You're what?

241
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,760
I'm still your sister.

242
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,360
Exactly.

243
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
Although you're like my sister,

244
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,439
it doesn't make your action less severe.

245
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
Once Mr. Baramee is back tomorrow,

246
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,600
I will report everything to him.

247
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,440
Any further punishment you shall receive

248
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,760
will be entirely up to him.

249
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,440
Got it?

250
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,160
Loud and clear.

251
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Once Mr. Baramee knows about it,

252
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,160
I will accept all the consequences.

253
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,240
The same goes for you.

254
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,240
I hope you can accept them.

255
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
Wait. Where are you going?

256
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,960
Where's my dinner?

257
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,240
Make it yourself.

258
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Hey.

259
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,320
Do you really think I was serious?

260
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,080
What makes you think I would love a girl like you?

261
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,520
No way.

262
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,360
And you have been

263
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
a great buffer.

264
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,520
Thanks for helping me drive Yada away.

265
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,520
I think this time

266
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,400
she will leave for good.

267
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,800
Stop it. Don't cry over him.

268
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
Once Mr. Baramee is back tomorrow,

269
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,840
I will report everything to him.

270
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,880
Any further punishment you shall receive

271
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,040
will be entirely up to him.

272
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,080
Mr. Baramee.

273
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,280
Finally,

274
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,280
tomorrow has to come.

275
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
Oyua.

276
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,759
Listen, keep watch on the house.

277
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,480
I'm going to work now, okay?

278
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,720
You silly dog.

279
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,720
Keep watch on the house, okay?

280
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Thian.

281
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,399
- Hmm? - I'm not a dog.

282
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,919
Oh, my bad.

283
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,560
I thought you were a lapdog.

284
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,080
You seem to be in a good mood today.

285
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,960
You bet I am.

286
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,480
I'm going to settle a score with Mr. Thada today.

287
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,040
I should be in a good mood, shouldn't I?

288
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,840
Don't forget that I helped, too.

289
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
How did you help?

290
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,880
If it wasn't for me, how would you acquire the evidence?

291
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,440
Hey, don't act like I owe you anything.

292
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,080
It's all thanks to me and my brilliance

293
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,720
for coming up with the plan.

294
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,919
The client is satisfied with the master plan

295
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,040
we stole from Thiarawat.

296
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,800
I feel like this is going much better than we thought.

297
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,840
It's not bad, Dad.

298
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,440
I think Natheerin

299
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,360
seem to have more use than your own daughter.

300
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,760
You seem to be especially interested in Natheerin.

301
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,839
If that's the case,

302
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,080
I guess my daughter is now a has-been.

303
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,120
It's me who actually get cast aside.

304
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,480
Don't forget that it's your daughter

305
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,560
who wants to get a divorce.

306
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,399
But you never know.

307
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,440
If I find a new woman I really like one day,

308
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,560
I might agree to the divorce.

309
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,360
Sir.

310
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,240
- What is it? - The police would like to see you.

311
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,400
- What? - What?

312
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,160
Let's go, Sir. I've cleared the path for you.

313
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,280
Let's go.

314
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,880
Mr. Thada, I'd like you to come to the station for questioning.

315
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,200
Please follow me.

316
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,760
Hey, Chet.

317
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,200
Hey, why are you in such a good mood?

318
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,200
Wait, Thian.

319
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,840
Did you collect your visa from the embassy?

320
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,320
You should start packing.

321
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,159
Aren't you leaving in two weeks?

322
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,800
I see Moei already collected hers.

323
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,600
I've got mine, but I haven't packed yet.

324
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,639
He gets to fly on a fancy jet to Hong Kong.

325
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,560
But poor Moei has to ride in a shabby van to Myanmar.

326
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,520
Chet.

327
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,160
While you and Mr. Baramee were away,

328
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,520
I've caught the hacker.

329
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,400
What? Really?

330
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,880
Let's go talk to Mr. Baramee together.

331
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,759
I'll show you the proof.

332
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,240
All right. I'll call Mr. Baramee and let him know.

333
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,680
You guys, tell Moei to wait for me here

334
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,160
when she gets here.

335
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,200
I'll go talk to Mr. Baramee first.

336
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,400
Then I'll get her.

337
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,360
- Okay? - All right.

338
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,440
- Thian, wait. - Nott.

339
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,400
- What? - Listen.

340
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,320
Don't be too harsh on Moei.

341
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,079
I feel bad for her.

342
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,880
Right. Try to stay calm.

343
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,680
- Did he hear us? - No idea.

344
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,840
I don't think so.

345
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,320
You broke the company's rules.

346
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,000
So you must be punished.

347
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,720
I'll give you the lesson you deserve.

348
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,800
It's on the news, Sir.

349
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,320
Mr. Thada and the executives of Thada Construction

350
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,800
were called for questioning

351
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,280
regarding the cybercrime against TPC.

352
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,960
I have the BOQ file, the design of our skyscraper in Hong Kong.

353
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,480
Our bids for this year's projects,

354
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,440
and all the blueprints Mr. Thada stole from us.

355
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,999
I got them all back.

356
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,240
The files Mr. Thada got from us weren't the real ones.

357
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,800
The real ones are with me.

358
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,840
Are you saying that you don't believe me?

359
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,320
I believe you, Thian.

360
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,960
The files you got back are fake.

361
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,600
- Fake? - Yes.

362
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,280
I think it's time we tell Thian the truth.

363
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,919
What truth?

364
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,520
I'm sorry for keeping this from you.

365
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,000
The truth is I had someone handle this from the start.

366
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,640
It was she and I who leaked the files

367
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,640
as a ploy to catch Mr. Thada.

368
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,600
Once Mr. Baramee knows about it,

369
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,080
I will accept all the consequences.

370
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,320
The same goes for you.

371
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,080
I hope you can accept them.

372
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,640
You mean you've been working together to fool me.

373
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,760
If you want to be mad at someone, be mad at me.

374
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,680
Just don't blame Moei.

375
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,120
We wanted Mr. Thada to withdraw his shares

376
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,000
because we found out

377
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,840
that he was trying to steal information from TPC.

378
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,360
I had to come up with a plan

379
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,160
to catch him secretly.

380
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,520
We have to find someone to pose as Mr. Thada's spy

381
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,359
and steal the intel he wants from Thian

382
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,920
in order to gain his trust.

383
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,320
Why do you think he will trust someone so easily?

384
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,400
Once you know who I got as our hacker,

385
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,480
everything will become clear to you.

386
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,920
That person is Natheerin, a Hammoc employee.

387
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,000
She is a former winner of a hacking competition.

388
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
More importantly,

389
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,560
Yada doesn't like her

390
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,880
because she is Thian's wife.

391
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,920
So you plan to have Natheerin

392
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
to pretend that she's loyal to Mr. Thada.

393
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,400
She must convince him that she's in trouble.

394
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,560
Right now, Hammoc is about to be closed down by TPC.

395
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,920
If I can get a hold of TPC's classified intel for you,

396
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,320
you have to keep Hammoc running.

397
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,200
Do we have a deal?

398
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,880
That will be enough reason to convince Mr. Thada

399
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,680
that a girl like Natheerin

400
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,839
is willing to betray her husband.

401
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,160
Why did you want to see me?

402
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,520
I heard you have good IT skill.

403
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,720
I'd like to ask for your help

404
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,440
in protecting our data from being hacked.

405
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,280
Moei immediately came up with a plan

406
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,160
after you told her to submit her work to your email.

407
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,800
I ordered you to read them, not to put them aside.

408
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,360
Finish them by tomorrow.

409
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm totally fine.

410
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,199
Summarize everything and email it to me tonight.

411
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,640
My plan was to pretend to steal information from you.

412
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,440
I made changes to the files

413
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,600
and sent them to Mr. Thada.

414
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,520
The first hack took place with Chet

415
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,120
staying on the lookout.

416
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,400
Thian, your computer's been hacked.

417
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
- Hacked? - What?

418
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,360
- Your building designs showed up in another company. - What?

419
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,519
I can't do this alone.

420
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,800
That's why I need your help.

421
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,799
The latest order we got

422
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,200
was to penetrate the company's server.

423
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,879
We need several distant hacking methods,

424
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,600
in case things go wrong.

425
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,840
That way, things got easier.

426
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,960
Why did you have to steal my work?

427
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,960
You could've asked me nicely.

428
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,000
We found out.

429
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,320
Mr. Thada wanted to have you on board.

430
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
He had you monitored at all times.

431
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,600
When we got our intel leaked

432
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,440
and you weren't the least bit troubled,

433
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000
he would get suspicious.

434
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,160
Are you saying I'm a bad actor?

435
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,920
No, that's not what I mean.

436
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,240
Why did you hack into the company's server

437
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,280
and caused the IT team all fuss?

438
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,720
We didn't know if they had anyone working in IT.

439
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,000
We did get our intel leaked.

440
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,600
And we had no idea who did it.

441
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,480
I asked Moei to hack into our system for real.

442
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,000
So the IT team could check for security holes.

443
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,160
Now Moei has already located the weak spot.

444
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,280
So Moei is actually working for TPC.

445
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,560
Luckily, someone bought all of Mr. Thada's shares in TPC

446
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,520
before the incident happened,

447
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,880
That's why no real harm was done to our company.

448
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,920
Hey.

449
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,000
Are we done here?

450
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,080
Wait, Thian.

451
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,240
Push up my flight to Hong Kong.

452
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,720
I don't care, just make it happen.

453
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,520
Get me the earliest flight.

454
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,040
Yes, that flight.

455
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,280
Hey.

456
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,160
Thian, what did Mr. Baramee say about Moei?

457
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,639
Why did you change your flight?

458
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,760
Yeah, is there a problem?

459
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,120
- There must be, I can tell. - You can tell us.

460
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,040
Don't ask an idiot like me.

461
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,400
You are an idiot?

462
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,000
What are you talking about?

463
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Thian.

464
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,000
I need to talk to you.

465
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,160
What the hell is going on?

466
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,920
- I really smell something fishy. - Right.

467
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,999
What's with him? He seemed protective of her at first.

468
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,400
How did he get like this?

469
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,480
What the hell?

470
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:07,840
Let's go.

471
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,440
Someone who can tell us is over there.

472
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,400
Nott, come on. Stop him.

473
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,160
Stop. Stop right there.

474
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Chet.

475
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,600
Tell us what happened.

476
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,960
Even you don't tell us, we'll get you to talk eventually.

477
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,760
- So? - Well...

478
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,440
I...

479
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,720
The thing is...

480
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,600
Moei is not a spy sent by Mr. Thada.

481
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,720
She's actually the one

482
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,080
who Mr. Baramee asked

483
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,080
to help catch him.

484
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,280
What?

485
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
And the reason...

486
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,800
Thian is so pissed is because he just found out.

487
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,360
Mr. Baramee is actually behind the hacking.

488
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,040
So you all knew from the start that Moei was the hacker?

489
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Yes.

490
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,560
Thian.

491
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,080
I'm sorry.

492
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,120
I know I was wrong.

493
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,320
I was really wrong.

494
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,280
You can yell at me, scold me,

495
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,080
or blame me all you want.

496
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,760
I'll accept it.

497
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,160
The stupid one is me.

498
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,000
And me alone.

499
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,960
I can't believe this.

500
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,000
- You're not stupid. - How am I not?

501
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,200
Everyone knows the truth except me.

502
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I ran around like a maniac trying to find out what happened

503
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,960
when everyone already knew.

504
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,000
I'm so stupid. I'm a fool, a damn fool.

505
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,240
- Do you get that? - No!

506
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,280
I have already told you.

507
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,840
I hate traitors

508
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,400
more than anything.

509
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,000
I hate liars.

510
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,200
- I know - Do you have anything to tell me?

511
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,240
I promise I won't get mad.

512
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,440
I gave you that chance.

513
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,840
Nice.

514
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,400
You will remember this for a very long time.

515
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,200
What's the type of guy you like?

516
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,000
I like clever guy.

517
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,000
- A very clever guy. - Why?

518
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,440
Maybe because I am not a clever one.

519
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,160
- Did you bring your mind to work? - What?

520
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,360
- Bind them all into books. - Binding all these?

521
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,400
- Is it too hard to understand? - No, it's not. I'll do it.

522
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,840
If she can't do a simple task, don't think to be an architect assistant.

523
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,040
It's done.

524
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,600
But this isn't how I wanted it.

525
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,640
This is just the beginning.

526
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,080
If you want to work with me, you have to be hard working and patient.

527
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,880
Did you consider my kiss bad luck?

528
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,280
What kiss?

529
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Don't pull an amnesia act.

530
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,520
I'm concerned about you for a bigger matter.

531
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,240
I'm talking about your computer getting hacked.

532
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,920
What are you going to do next?

533
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,040
- What is this for? - I know that you are going to pull an all-nighter

534
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,160
for tomorrow's presentation,

535
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,760
And all of your works were stolen.

536
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,520
Thian, don't forget to change your password.

537
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,920
You might get hacked again.

538
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,880
So, you write poems?

539
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,160
Of course, I do.

540
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,080
I do when I see dangers.

541
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,800
Moei.

542
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,000
You're the hacker?

543
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,600
No way.

544
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,800
That's impossible.

545
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,119
You're not that skillful.

546
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,240
I hate liars.

547
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,280
- I know. - Do you have anything to tell me?

548
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,280
I promise I won't get mad.

549
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,840
I've loved him for a long time.

550
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,600
Many more years than you have.

551
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,840
Probably since before you even knew he existed.

552
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,920
Happy birthday, Thian.

553
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,360
May all your days be filled with happiness.

554
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,280
Hey, come here.

555
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,680
Ever since I've known him,

556
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,680
I've never seen him this upset.

557
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,120
I guess it hit him really hard this time.

558
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,760
Before he went to see Mr. Baramee,

559
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,720
I was talking to him.

560
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,199
Thian, I think you should calm down.

561
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,919
She has to pay for her mistake.

562
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,760
Wait. I'm begging you.

563
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,759
Don't be too harsh on her. I feel bad for her.

564
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,040
Why? Do you think I'll cut her throat?

565
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,400
- Damn right. - I'm not that cruel.

566
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,560
You might do something stupid when you're angry.

567
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,960
It's never been my intention to hurt Moei.

568
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,999
No matter how serious her mistake is,

569
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,560
she's still my sister.

570
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Beer.

571
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,399
I'm actually going to ask Mr. Baramee to keep this a secret.

572
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,640
I don't want the TPC board to know about this,

573
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,719
so they won't press charges.

574
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,680
I'll send Moei and everyone involved

575
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,080
to Myanmar as punishment.

576
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,840
If the board decides to take action,

577
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,440
it will be worse for her.

578
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,000
It could affect her future.

579
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,800
All right.

580
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,560
I get it now why he's so mad.

581
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,800
He did everything to help Moei

582
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,000
not to be punished by the company.

583
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,440
But it turned out everything was their plan.

584
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,760
Moei didn't mean to betray the company like he thought.

585
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,200
So everything he did to protect Moei

586
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,960
was for nothing.

587
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,240
Oh, man, this is so sad.

588
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,960
Poor Thian.

589
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,640
Toon.

590
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,200
- What? - Get me more booze.

591
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,280
- No problem, mate. - Hey.

592
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,800
Thian. I think you should go home.

593
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,320
- Yeah. - I'm not going.

594
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,880
I want to get drunk.

595
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,880
Aren't you drunk already?

596
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,400
- Huh? - No.

597
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,960
Why get so worked up?

598
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,920
- We can't drink anymore. - Yeah.

599
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,400
I'm getting all queasy.

600
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,080
We all want to go home.

601
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
Hey.

602
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,279
Chet.

603
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,000
- Please wait me over there. - Is it Chet?

604
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Hey, Thian.

605
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,720
What are you doing here?

606
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,559
Thian. What the hell, man?

607
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,840
Thian, are you out of your mind?

608
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,880
Why did you punch me, Thian?

609
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,279
Still have a nerve asking me?

610
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,400
You and Moei played me like a fool.

611
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,520
It's not okay. It's not okay at all.

612
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,120
Beer, get him out of here.

613
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,680
Easy, man.

614
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,119
-Thian. - Easy does it.

615
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,880
- Jeez. - Damn it.

616
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,120
No, don't sleep here. No, don't, don't fall.

617
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,000
- Help me. - Thian, come on.

618
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,680
Let me help.

619
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,200
No!

620
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,879
No! You can't sleep here.

621
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,480
Come here. Out of my way.

622
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,160
- Come on, Thian. - Back off.

623
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,480
I've got him. Let's go.

624
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,800
- Let me. - Move! Let's go.

625
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,000
- Your room is over there. - Right.

626
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,960
Come right this way.

627
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,920
Turn right, mate.

628
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,360
My heart is broken.

629
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,160
It hurts to the core.

630
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,319
Thian, do you mind if I sleep here?

631
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,479
No, you can't.

632
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,600
We have to leave.

633
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,560
Hey, Thian. I'll get going now.

634
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,799
Have a sweet dream. It's your bedtime.

635
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,080
Hey, see you later.

636
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,440
- Take care, Thian. - See you.

637
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,520
Are you leaving now?

638
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,720
Toon.

639
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,360
I don't know anymore.

640
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,920
Know what?

641
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,760
I don't know what's real

642
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,600
and what's fake.

643
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,480
I really can't tell anymore.

644
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,199
Go.

645
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,280
Get out of here.

646
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,480
- You get out. - Go.

647
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,680
Okay.

648
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,080
Let's go. Why did you have to yell?

649
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,360
Who's yelling?

650
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,320
Take off your shoes, okay?

651
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,440
Thian.

652
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,120
Come on, Thian.

653
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,280
Take off your blazer.

654
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,680
I'll wipe for you.

655
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,360
Leave me alone.

656
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,360
Come on, Thian.

657
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,120
Get off of me.

658
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,440
I'll do it just like this then.

659
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,720
No.

660
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,440
Come on, Thian.

661
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,600
Get out of my sight.

662
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,920
Easy, Doctor. It hurts.

663
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,200
It's a deep cut. You'll need stitches.

664
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,240
What?

665
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,480
Is that really necessary?

666
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,279
Can I not get stitches?

667
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,560
If you don't get stitches

668
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,400
and the cut gets bigger,

669
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,640
you'll be disfigured.

670
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,720
What?

671
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,440
Disfigured?

672
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,280
Oh, no.

673
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,800
Nott.

674
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,520
Thank you, Nott.

675
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,720
You're really kind, you know.

676
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Nott.

677
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,359
I know he is really mad that he got fooled.

678
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,000
Can you blame him?

679
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,760
Think about it.

680
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,520
We worked so hard to catch the hacker.

681
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,680
- Nott, you need to understand... - Chet.

682
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,880
I know you approached me

683
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,240
to get information out of me.

684
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,760
You feared that Thian might catch Moei.

685
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,359
No, Nott. Listen to me.

686
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,120
You know, we all have the company's best interest at heart.

687
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,359
Now I know what it feels like

688
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,720
to be betrayed by your own company.

689
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,000
- Nott, it's not like that. - Chet, no.

690
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,040
If you're fine now,

691
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,040
you go back on your own.

692
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,080
Nott. Come on.

693
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,080
So Moei is actually working for Mr. Baramee,

694
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,640
not Mr. Thada?

695
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,880
What? So that means Moei lied to us.

696
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,760
Come on. Let's just calm down.

697
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,200
Well, she didn't exactly lie to us.

698
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,399
She probably kept it from us to be discreet.

699
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,560
Do you get that?

700
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,760
I do.

701
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,720
At first I thought Moei was helping Mr. Thada to get back at Thian.

702
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,320
But turned out it's a family matter.

703
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,480
Damn.

704
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,360
Moei is like.

705
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,719
Thian's personal slave.

706
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,200
He's such a jerk.

707
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,440
You're getting all worked up again. Calm down, will you?

708
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,600
Here's the thing.

709
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,000
I'd like some advice from you seniors.

710
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,240
Moei is really stressed out right now.

711
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,800
Thian is furious.

712
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,919
I've never seen Moei this stressed out before.

713
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,000
What should we do?

714
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,080
I think, right now,

715
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,400
it will be best for Moei to do nothing at all.

716
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,960
- What? - What?

717
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,920
Kob, what kind of lousy advice is that?

718
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,120
Sit down.

719
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,640
You're unbelievable.

720
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,080
What I mean is,

721
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,840
she should leave him alone.

722
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,600
Do not trigger him in any way.

723
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,800
Because right now,

724
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,840
Thian is like a typhoon that's ready to sweep everything.

725
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,079
- My goodness. - That's true.

726
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,599
That's really some way to describe him.

727
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,600
- Yeah. - Right?

728
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,280
- Nice one. - Good.

729
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,360
Do you want me to confess?

730
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,000
I gave him my daughter

731
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,640
and let him walk all over.

732
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,520
Now he's going to leave me to take all the blame?

733
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,720
You shouldn't testify against Mr. Pondej

734
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,320
who has nothing to do with this.

735
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,880
What did you say? He has nothing to do with this?

736
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,040
You say that again.

737
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,680
Sir, please calm down.

738
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,120
If you confess,

739
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,320
Mr. Pondej will help bail you out as soon as possible.

740
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,600
And there's one more thing.

741
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,680
Mr. Pondej asked me to tell you

742
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,800
whatever you decide,

743
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,400
think of Yada's future and her safety.

744
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,120
Is he using my daughter to blackmail me?

745
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,520
If you don't do as he says,

746
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,120
he can't guarantee

747
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,920
what will happen to Yada.

748
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,920
Damn it!

749
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,800
It's now the time

750
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,079
your daughter and that prick

751
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,720
pay for what they've done to me.

752
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,320
You think I'll…

753
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,960
do that to Yada?

754
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,400
I would never do anything to my wife.

755
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,560
If this Natheerin were to betray us,

756
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,040
I'd take care of her

757
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,160
the same way I did to your daughter.

758
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,920
Your only task is going back to Pondej

759
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,080
and doing your best as his wife.

760
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,840
You'd better try to accept the fact

761
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,360
that you'll have to be with him for your whole life.

762
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,719
Didn't you say you wanted Thada Construction

763
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,160
to be able to stand on its feet

764
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,159
so we wouldn't have to be afraid of him?

765
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,320
Yes. But as long as he's a benefit to us,

766
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,720
You're so selfish.

767
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,679
You only think of yourself.

768
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,920
You never asked how I felt about it.

769
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,440
You never cared whether or not I was happy.

770
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,920
You never asked me that.

771
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,160
I care for you. That's why I'm doing all this.

772
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,800
Is this how you care for me?

773
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,120
I hate you.

774
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,200
It's soup for your hangover.

775
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,600
Please eat up.

776
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,040
You'll feel better.

777
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,120
The news reported this morning

778
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,640
that Mr. Thada confessed.

779
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,279
We have to wait and see what the judge decides.

780
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,280
Right.

781
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,680
Pondej managed to escape,

782
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,680
but some netizens spotted him

783
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,520
fleeing the country last night.

784
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,000
Anyway,

785
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,840
at least they caught Thada, the ringleader.

786
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,520
It pleases me. He deserves it.

787
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,600
But I feel most sorry for this girl on the screen here.

788
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,000
Look, Moei.

789
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,800
Thian might be mad at you,

790
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,160
but none of us are.

791
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,120
That's right. We're not mad.

792
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,360
Hey.

793
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:52,079
Ultimately, you're the one who saved Hammoc.

794
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,560
TPC really owes you big time.

795
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,600
Thian should be thanking you.

796
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,760
He's...

797
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,920
so mad

798
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,320
because everyone...

799
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,120
conspired to deceive him.

800
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,120
Anyway,

801
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,280
thank you all so much

802
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,760
for your understanding.

803
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,000
- No problem. - It's really okay.

804
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,200
Don't worry.

805
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,680
So,

806
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,760
when are you coming to Dawei?

807
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,360
I…

808
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,240
I need to take care of something here first.

809
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,280
Then I'll be there.

810
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,200
- Okay. - Please come soon.

811
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,680
- I miss you. Bring me snacks, will you? - Hang in there.

812
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,600
- Hello. - How's it going?

813
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,040
Are you here to say goodbye?

814
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,760
Yes.

815
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,360
Are you sure you don't want to go to Hong Kong?

816
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,920
I'd rather not.

817
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,880
I really want to go to Myanmar.

818
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,440
Very well. If you want to go, I won't stop you.

819
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,640
We could really use more people there.

820
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,200
You have nothing to be afraid of over there.

821
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,200
Lots of our staff are there.

822
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,440
It's not as dangerous as you think.

823
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,640
The people who got there first

824
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,720
already had all the utilities set up.

825
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,440
We have water and electricity as we need.

826
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:56,000
If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask me.

827
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,040
Actually,

828
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,440
there's one thing I need

829
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,480
that I must ask you to send me

830
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,640
because I can't take it with me.

831
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,880
Chet.

832
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,320
Hello.

833
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,080
Hello.

834
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,120
- Wait. - No, don't.

835
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,440
What happened to your mouth?

836
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,080
Don't you remember anything?

837
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,760
- Remember what? - Don't come any closer.

838
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,000
Just forget it.

839
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,240
What? I punched him last night?

840
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,040
He got three stitches.

841
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,440
Really?

842
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,160
You can't remember anything?

843
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,920
Yeah, can't remember a thing.

844
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,720
Don't even know how I got home.

845
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,360
Thian, Just get yourself together.

846
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,920
You're going to Hong Kong in a few days.

847
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,840
You can't be a mess like this.

848
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,680
The atmosphere is so freaking tense.

849
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,800
Looks like Thian won't forgive her easily.

850
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,320
I really feel bad for her.

851
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,120
What?

852
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,800
You aren't mad at her anymore?

853
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,440
I just adore her.

854
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,360
She has always been nice to us.

855
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,800
Think about it.

856
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,800
She just followed orders.

857
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,680
She didn't really want to lie to us.

858
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,040
That's what I think.

859
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,920
The problematic one is him.

860
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,760
Not only did you tell your friend about our secret,

861
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,119
but you're wearing the ring.

862
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,480
That's for disobeying me.

863
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,560
What?

864
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,720
When did I disobey you?

865
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,280
Take it off.

866
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,520
I meant the ring.

867
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,040
I told you to take it off.

868
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,560
Thian, what do you want to eat?

869
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,560
Salmon!

870
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,920
Every time when you eat salmon,

871
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,040
it puts you in a good mood. Am I right?

872
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,800
Hi, Kob.

873
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,160
Moei.

874
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,160
Hey, how are you doing?

875
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,000
I'm okay. I'm doing fine.

876
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,600
Wow.

877
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Kob.

878
01:10:25,001 --> 01:10:26,520
You got there just a few days ago.

879
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,000
You are all tanned now.

880
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,480
I bet I look tarnished than tanned.

881
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,280
Look at me. My face, my neck,

882
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,560
and my body are all in different shades.

883
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,040
You're right.

884
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,880
I'm just calling to tell you

885
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,760
to bring lots of sunscreen.

886
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,880
Oh.

887
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,439
Bring some for us too.

888
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,480
SPF 30 is not enough to protect me from the sun here.

889
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,360
All right. I'll bring lots of it.

890
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,160
Kob, I have to go.

891
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,920
Are you hungry?

892
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,040
I made you salmon steak.

893
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,480
Here. I'll plate it for you.

894
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,520
A new restaurant just opened across a street.

895
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,440
Let's all go there for lunch.

896
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,440
Count me in.

897
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,880
Me, too.

898
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,800
(I am good.)

899
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,480
(Thank you for inviting me, Beer.)

900
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,520
I'm good.

901
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,320
Thank you for inviting me, Beer.

902
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,800
I'd like to apologize to all of you

903
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,760
for everything that happened.

904
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:40,480
From now on, I won't be around to cause you trouble anymore.

905
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,360
(Moei has left the group.)

906
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,600
- Hey. - No.

907
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,680
Damn it, Beer.

908
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,719
You said that would lighten things up.

909
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,320
- Look, she just left the group. - Right.

910
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,280
- Are you crazy? - What now?

911
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,520
- You shouldn't have done anything. - Wait, this isn't my fault.

912
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,000
Then whose fault is it?

913
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,240
You're right. It's that jerk.

914
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,000
Thian.

915
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,800
What do you want?

916
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,519
How can you just sit there?

917
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,960
Don't you feel anything?

918
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,760
Why are you so mad at her?

919
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,000
She did it to help the company.

920
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,400
You're acting like a jerk. Do you know that?

921
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,759
He probably hasn't seen it.

922
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,800
Show him, Nott.

923
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,560
Moei has left the group chat.

924
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,760
- That's good. - How's good?

925
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,960
- Hey. - You know...

926
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,320
She's here.

927
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,120
From now on,

928
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,440
don't bother me again with this nonsense.

929
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,800
You all can go.

930
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,200
I've got work to do.

931
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,000
- You're unbelievable. - Moei.

932
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,800
Yes?

933
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,440
Why did you leave the group chat?

934
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,840
Well.

935
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,160
I'm leaving for Dawei in a few days.

936
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,760
You don't need me there anymore.

937
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,720
Of course, we do. Right?

938
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,760
Having you in the group helps lighten us up.

939
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,440
Thank you so much for trying to cheer me up.

940
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,840
But...

941
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,040
it's better that I leave.

942
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,640
Oh.

943
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,200
Uh...

944
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,280
I finished packing.

945
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,280
I won't be a nuisance to you anymore.

946
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,920
When did I ever say

947
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,120
that you were a nuisance?

948
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,360
I understand.

949
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,560
You did it to help the company.

950
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,399
I'm also one of TPC employees,

951
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,080
and your supervisor.

952
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,240
I say you did a great job.

953
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,120
But as your husband,

954
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,120
I consider you've done a terrible mistake

955
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,840
as a wife.

956
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,320
From now on,

957
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,320
stop saying that you only do things for my sake.

958
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:30,200
Nothing in this world happens by chance.

959
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,040
Everything happens for a reason.

960
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,360
There's a reason that we met.

961
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,120
Thank you.

962
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,640
Thank you so much.

963
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,880
If it weren't for you,

964
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,560
I wouldn't have a chance to go to a good school like this.

965
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,360
Thian is your peer mentor!

966
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,080
We have to keep our marriage a secret.

967
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,840
Once everything is over,

968
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,360
we'll get a divorce.

969
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,080
Why did you want to see me?

970
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,840
Protect our data from being hacked.

971
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,640
There's a reason

972
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,840
that we have to be apart.

973
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,120
- Your building designs showed up in another company. - What?

974
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,840
Moei!

975
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,320
I'm very disappointed in you.

976
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,080
Everything happens has meaning

977
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,760
and it's telling something.

978
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,799
We're making so much of it.

979
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,200
This will easily last me a year.

980
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,800
More is better than less, Moei.

981
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,840
You're too stingy, Prapha.

982
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,160
Should she eat nothing, but spicy dried shrimp paste all year?

983
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,120
Don't worry, Moei.

984
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,720
I'll have someone cook you more food and send it to you.

985
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,480
Okay.

986
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,960
That's too much.

987
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,720
- Let me help, Mom. - All right. Give it a try.

988
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,920
- Don't let it get in your eyes. - I won't.

989
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,400
- Oh. - See?

990
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,520
What did I just say?

991
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,119
- Go rinse your eyes. - Are you okay?

992
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:12,840
Rinse them with water. I just told you to be careful.

993
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,480
Are you okay? That must sting a lot.

994
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,760
Let me see.

995
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,200
Better?

996
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,560
They still sting.

997
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,920
Get the first aid kit.

998
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,599
Get her some eye drops.

999
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,919
You can cook later.

1000
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,880
Poor girl. You should be more careful.

1001
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,360
Hey, here you are, you rascal.

1002
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,680
What?

1003
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,120
I just walked in and got scolded already?

1004
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,040
That's right. I'll scold you for seven days straight.

1005
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,600
I can even go on for a year.

1006
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,200
I never thought you'd be so cruel and send Moei to Dawei.

1007
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,959
I told you it's for work.

1008
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,280
I know it's for work,

1009
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,600
but why didn't you help her when you could?

1010
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,080
Aren't you worried or sorry for her at all?

1011
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,560
No, Mom. I'm not worried neither sorry for her.

1012
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,520
If you knew what she did to me, you wouldn't blame me like this.

1013
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,240
You're being nonsense.

1014
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,920
How could she hurt a grown-ass man like you?

1015
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,000
Of course. I'm always in the wrong.

1016
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,200
Don't you dare get worked up with me.

1017
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,080
I'm telling you. You'll miss her once she's gone.

1018
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,440
- Aunt Jee. - Yes?

1019
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,240
It's all right.

1020
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,400
I really don't mind going to Dawei.

1021
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,040
A lot of my friends are there.

1022
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,760
But there's one thing that I'd like to ask you

1023
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,800
and Mom to help me with.

1024
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,920
What is it?

1025
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,920
It's this boy, my little Oyua.

1026
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,679
While I'm away, can you look after him for me?

1027
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,999
Of course, Dear.

1028
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,160
Thank you.

1029
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,320
Thank you so much.

1030
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,240
Thank you.

1031
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,800
I bet you want to let off some steam.

1032
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,639
Hey, Thian.

1033
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,359
While Mon are I are away, you must call Choy and Odd hotline for advice.

1034
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,240
- You mean Aoy and Chod. - Yeah, that's it.

1035
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,600
Where are you going?

1036
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,240
Mon and I were asked to go to Dawei right away.

1037
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,400
They are short-handed.

1038
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,560
You don't have to worry about Moei anymore.

1039
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,960
Ri and I will help look after her.

1040
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,920
Hey, who said I was worried?

1041
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,200
I never say that. What do you misunderstand?

1042
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,480
Look, Thian.

1043
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,200
What's the deal between you and Moei?

1044
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,040
Why is she going to Dawei while you're going to Hong Kong?

1045
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,600
Where should I start?

1046
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,720
The 10 million baht, the divorce,

1047
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,840
her betrayal,

1048
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,119
or my work?

1049
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,200
She has to go to Dawei as her punishment.

1050
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,760
So, have you managed to find 10 million baht?

1051
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,680
- Stop it. - What's the matter?

1052
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,799
I won't tell you.

1053
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,040
You'll rat me out to Mom.

1054
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,519
Why would you get a divorce? Don't do it.

1055
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,680
- You'll save 10 million baht. - Hah.

1056
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,040
I'll sell my spleen and kidney if need be.

1057
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,960
I need to get that money to divorce her.

1058
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,319
Oh, he's selling his spleen.

1059
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,360
I can't stand living with her.

1060
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,640
Whoa.

1061
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,159
I smell drama.

1062
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,680
A real dramatic one.

1063
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:41,000
Mom and Aunt Jee are packing my things in my room.

1064
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,800
I know. Otherwise, it wouldn't be this quiet.

1065
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,400
Wait, Thian.

1066
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,360
I'm leaving tomorrow already.

1067
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,720
I know you don't want to eat.

1068
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,280
But will you please have some?

1069
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,320
This might be the last meal

1070
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,360
I get to cook for you.

1071
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,200
And I don't know

1072
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,080
when we'll see each other again.

1073
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,520
Well.

1074
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,280
I'll go help my mom pack.

1075
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,520
Do you forget anything?

1076
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,080
In that case, I can mail it to you later.

1077
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,520
We should get going. You'll miss your flight.

1078
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,040
- Okay. - Let's go.

1079
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,320
Moei.

1080
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,080
Let's go, Dear.

1081
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,280
Thian.

1082
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,000
Please take good care of yourself.

1083
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,800
Until we meet again.

1084
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,720
I put the food in the freezer.

1085
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,880
You can heat it up and eat it.

1086
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,160
A little closer, Dear.

1087
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,760
Come closer, Dear. He won't bite.

1088
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,600
One, two, three,

1089
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,240
smile!

1090
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,679
Hope you don't mind me taking this photo. I want to remember first day.

1091
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,960
I came in this house.

1092
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,480
Hey!

1093
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,160
Moei!

1094
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,920
Hey!

1095
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,040
I know you've missed me.

1096
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,600
You're squeezing me.

1097
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,800
Moei.

1098
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,640
What's wrong?

1099
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,800
- Hey, she's crying. - Hey.

1100
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:24,600
Moei.

1101
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,920
It's okay, Moei.

1102
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,960
Sometimes, we have to shed our tears

1103
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,320
to start over again.

1104
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,520
Sometimes, one may want to run away from another

1105
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:50,960
to get a fresh start.

1106
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,160
But do you know the old saying,

1107
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,880
what you run from will find you

1108
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,960
and you'll end up getting what you hate?

1109
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,800
Is he here? Ri, Mon.

1110
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,840
Yes.

1111
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,920
There's one thing I need

1112
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,240
that I must ask you to send me

1113
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,840
because I can't take it with me.

1114
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,200
What is it?

1115
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,840
It's Thian.

1116
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,240
What's up, Thian?

1117
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,880
How was your trip?

1118
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,280
Look at him.

1119
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,120
- No responding. - Not a word.

1120
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,160
Hey, it's broken!

1121
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,280
Don't let me find out who did this.

1122
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,240
If I find you, I'll kick your ass.

1123
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:38,880
So did you give your peer mentor the farewell present?

1124
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,800
- I had someone give it to him. - Really?

1125
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,360
But I don't know whether he will like it.

1126
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,040
(From your peer mentee)

1127
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,439
Wow, that's a really pretty box.

1128
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,040
It must be something fancy.

1129
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,680
Look at his face.

1130
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,840
Here, comes the snake.

1131
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,040
Are you scared of snakes, man?

1132
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,480
Who sent it?

1133
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:12,640
What a surprise.

1134
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,920
Moei!

1135
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,520
- What is it? - A mess thing happens.

1136
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,760
You're so dead.

1137
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,680
What's going on?

1138
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,080
What should I do?

1139
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,239
I didn't give him a snake.

1140
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:33,080
I gave him a handmade scarf that I knitted myself.

1141
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,840
Someone must have messed with you.

1142
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,480
It's either his friend

1143
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:39,280
or someone who has a crush on him

1144
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,360
and is jealous of you.

1145
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,240
Because you're his peer mentee.

1146
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,519
But right now,

1147
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,800
Thian is going to the registration office

1148
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:49,240
to get your student ID number.

1149
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,160
He will know that you're his peer mentee.

1150
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,800
- What do I do? - You're so dead.

1151
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,159
What should I do, Tum?

1152
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:00,720
He can't know I'm his peer mentee.

1153
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,280
I have to find out who you are.

1154
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,400
You little devil.

1155
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,879
I got an idea, Tum.

1156
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,240
What?

1157
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,680
Who was that?

1158
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,440
Where did he go?

1159
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,520
Come on. Let's go hide over there.

1160
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,560
Come on.

1161
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,840
Just leave it here.

1162
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,360
- Just dump it. - Hey, stop!

1163
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,920
- Run. - Stop right there!

1164
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,320
Come on, run!

1165
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,960
Stop!

1166
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,440
Whoa, sorry.

1167
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,280
Come on, this way. Come on.

1168
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,160
Go. Go.

1169
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,679
Oh, my shoe.

1170
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,199
I said stop! Stop right there.

1171
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,680
- Come on. - I said stop.

1172
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,400
Just leave it.

1173
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,120
"56349".

1174
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:26,200
- What is this? - Get in here. Come on. Hurry!

1175
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,520
Stop!

1176
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:29,200
Stop!

1177
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,800
Stop.

1178
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,080
What are you doing in the girls' restroom?

1179
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,680
- Answer me. - Uh…

1180
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,200
Are you a peeping Tom?

1181
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,319
No. I'm just...

1182
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,560
Then get out.

1183
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,520
- But... - Are you a pervert?

1184
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,920
- No. - Get out.

1185
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,760
- I'll smack you. - Whoa, no!

1186
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,040
Okay, I'll leave.

1187
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,120
He's gone.

1188
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:32,040
Oh, no. This is bad.

1189
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,440
He is going to hate this peer mentee of his now.

1190
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:44,320
What makes you so mad at me?

1191
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,560
What did I...

1192
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,760
Stop it.

1193
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,400
You asked Mr. Baramee to send me here, right?

1194
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,000
What makes you think you could escape me?

1195
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,120
You seem to have the nerve to try me.

1196
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,440
I'm so sorry for everything, Thian.

1197
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,080
I just want to make the most of my time I have with you

1198
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:09,080
before we really have to say goodbye.

1199
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,280
If this is how you want to play,

1200
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,520
you'd better watch your back.

1201
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:19,920
It's you who should watch out.

1202
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:23,280
What you run from will find you.

1203
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:26,240
You'll end up getting what you hate.

1204
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:27,840
That's sharp.

1205
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,680
- That's my girl. - I'm telling you right now.

1206
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:34,560
You can't run away from me.

1207
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,400
Take my luggage.

1208
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,279
No problem.

1209
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:50,840
Welcome to Dawei.

1210
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,080
Follow me, Thian.

1211
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,480
This is fun.

1212
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,480
- This way, please. - Come on, we have an air-conditioned room.

1213
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,080
If don't get up, I'll cut your pay.

1214
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,159
Is it too hot for you?

1215
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,440
It's hot for everyone.

1216
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,000
Whoa!

1217
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,719
First, sign me the divorce papers

1218
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:15,360
and give me 10 million baht.

1219
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,560
What's the second option?

1220
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,680
You just have to let me court you.

1221
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:25,040
Hand in the reports in an hour.

1222
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,720
You keep me busy.

1223
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,960
Are you afraid I'll make a move on you? Huh?

1224
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:30,920
You know very well what Moei and I are.

1225
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:33,880
And if I win,

1226
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,240
you have to let me pursue Moei.
