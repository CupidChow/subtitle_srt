1
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,400
Wake up! Wake up!

2
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,840
I'll deduct your salary if you don't.

3
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,280
- Is it too hot for you? - It's hot for everyone.

4
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,440
First, sign a divorce paper

5
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,159
and give me 10 million baht.

6
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,400
What's another option?

7
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,880
Just let me court you.

8
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,800
Finish the report in one hour.

9
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,440
You got me so busy

10
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,159
to stop me from courting you.

11
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,239
Right?

12
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,320
Moei.

13
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,560
Can you give me a chance?

14
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
- Kob. - I'll wait for the day,

15
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
when you divorce him.

16
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,039
Now, I know

17
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,680
why you got married with Moei.

18
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,520
I'm not done talking with her.

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,839
You can talk now. I'll be listening, too.

20
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
I want to talk to her in private.

21
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
You know very well what I am to her.

22
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
Are you challenging me?

23
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,080
Yes.

24
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,800
If I win,

25
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,040
you have to let me pursue Moei.

26
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,720
You guys work on this one.

27
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
We're behind schedule now.

28
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,999
Should I start the piling?

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,440
- Just do it. - Okay.

30
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,440
- You call the guy so they can start. - Okay.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,520
- Will they come quickly? - You come with me.

32
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,640
Thian.

33
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,240
You have to cancel the challenge.

34
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,560
Kob may look like a quiet humble guy.

35
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
But he's more skillful than you think.

36
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,120
So?

37
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
You think I can't beat him?

38
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,400
That's exactly what I think.

39
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,840
If you don't want to get beaten with Bird Peeping Through Nest.

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,320
Break the Elephant's Neck.

41
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,880
Or Crocodile Thrashes by Its Tail.

42
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,439
You have to cancel it right now.

43
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,360
I'll never cancel it.

44
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
The more you keep bragging how good he is,

45
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,080
the more I want to know

46
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,040
if he is as good as I am.

47
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,080
- Thian. - Anyone has a problem,

48
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,280
come to see me inside.

49
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Beer.

50
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,600
Nott, Toon.

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,200
You all have to help me.

52
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,800
Convince him to cancel the fight.

53
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,680
I guess I can't help you.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
Because we can't let those guys humiliate us.

55
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
That's right.

56
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,040
If we don't accept this challenge,

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,640
it's a shame for TPC as well.

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
Tell me what you want.

59
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,280
Get me a hand scraper.

60
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,840
Get me a crane.

61
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,960
- Yeah. - Right.

62
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,999
What?

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
I nearly screwed the blueprint.

64
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,759
Got a bit carried away.

65
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,440
Gosh, Toon.

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,640
You want Thian to scold you?

67
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,560
Are you sure there's no one around?

68
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,599
Absolutely, everyone is having lunch break.

69
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,360
There're just the two of us now.

70
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,399
We haven't had a chance

71
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,920
to be alone at all since you came.

72
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,800
We're finally alone now.

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,680
- Whoa! - Whoa!

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,280
Sorry.

75
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,560
Ri, Mon.

76
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,880
You gotta help me.

77
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Thian.

78
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,000
Gosh, this guy. Thian, wait.

79
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,159
Hey, are you out of your mind challenging a fight?

80
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,240
What?

81
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,920
Moei told you that I would fight with her boss?

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,240
Yes, she did.

83
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,760
Wait.

84
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,800
Moei is worried about you.

85
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,239
Can't you solve it with a talk?

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,999
Why do you need to fight it out?

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,240
You only need to know

88
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,960
I agreed to do this for Moei.

89
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,640
All right?

90
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,840
Wait.

91
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,120
Are you saying

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,680
he planned to do something with Moei?

93
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,360
Something like that.

94
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,840
That's why I have to fight to protect my sister.

95
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,920
Well done, Thian.

96
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,040
What?

97
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,280
What? Mon, wait.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
- Are you... - Don't.

99
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
Losing is not an option.

100
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,080
Got it?

101
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,480
I don't know now.

102
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,159
Do as you please.

103
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,440
Let's go back to our tent.

104
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,320
- Come cheer for me. - I will.

105
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,480
- Is it done? - Yes.

106
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,400
- What about over there? - We're working on it.

107
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Good.

108
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,200
What about over there? Have you checked?

109
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,199
Come on, people, speed up.

110
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,280
Move it quick.

111
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,920
- Hey, Nott. - What?

112
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,680
TPC's pride is at stake.

113
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,720
Wait up.

114
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
Thian. You go to them and say,

115
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,720
"cha-nor kin-mya go chit-teh"

116
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,520
I assure you they'll speed up right away.

117
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,760
Cha-nor a-go chit-teh.

118
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
What does it mean?

119
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:24,800
It means they should speed up.

120
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,680
I guess your accent isn't good enough.

121
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,360
They don't seem to get the message.

122
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,480
Listen.

123
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,120
Cha-nor a-go chit-teh.

124
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,600
Thian.

125
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,400
Are you sure you want to say that to them?

126
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,840
Absolutely.

127
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,080
I want them to speed up.

128
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,600
But what you said doesn't mean that at all.

129
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
What?

130
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,480
What does it mean then?

131
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,680
It means.

132
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,360
"I love you."

133
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,160
I just don't want you to have a fight with Kob.

134
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,279
Boss, it's not too late to change your mind.

135
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,680
You're going to get a big lesson later.

136
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,920
I'll make your friends kneel before me

137
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
and beg for life.

138
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,680
Stop it!

139
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,560
In a few minutes, we're about to go live

140
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,320
on a match of the month.

141
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,240
Reporting live from Dawei.

142
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,280
Dawei district in Tanintharyi Region of Myanmar.

143
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
It's a match of two teams.

144
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,240
- Go Hammoc! - Tum.

145
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,120
You said Thian challenged Kob into a fight.

146
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
What? Did you believe that?

147
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,240
- You're such a fool. - You got me dead worried.

148
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,520
There, there, there! I was just kidding.

149
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,760
Go, Hammoc! Hammoc. Go! Go!

150
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,280
Go, Hammoc!

151
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,040
TPC Go! Go!

152
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,480
Hey, over there.

153
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,200
- Go there. - TPC!

154
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,280
We can't let TPC get louder than us!

155
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,520
And now the game has begun.

156
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,240
TPC got intercepted by Hammoc.

157
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,160
Hammoc, will you get it? They failed to intercept.

158
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,120
Go, Thian!

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,720
Hey! It's a score for TPC.

160
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,000
You're supposed to cheer for Hammoc not for your husband.

161
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,600
What's the plan now?

162
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Did they recruit national players in the team?

163
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,240
Messi Jay or what?

164
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,079
Come on. They aren't that good.

165
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,959
It's only half time. Don't be discouraged.

166
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,520
It won't be an easy task to pass over me.

167
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,719
The game isn't over.

168
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,080
Don't judge it too soon.

169
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
See you in the field.

170
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,680
Moei.

171
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,880
- Yes? - Cheer for me, will you?

172
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,560
Because you're my energy.

173
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,400
You got it.

174
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,680
I'll scream my heart out to cheer for you.

175
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,880
Kob. Go! Go!

176
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,240
Kob. Go! Go!

177
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,400
Thian.

178
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,800
What's up with you?

179
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,040
You seem distracted.

180
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,360
Yeah, you should have passed the ball to me.

181
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
It's all right. Let's try again.

182
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,560
- Are you all right, Kob? - What the heck?

183
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,560
TPC. Go! Go!

184
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,080
TPC. Go! Go!

185
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,759
The time is up!

186
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,279
For the final score, Hammock won 2-1 scores.

187
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,440
So, Hammoc is the winner.

188
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
It's all right. You may have lost the game.

189
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,120
But you won my heart.

190
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,240
It's all right, everyone.

191
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,560
You must be exhausted.

192
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,280
Hey.

193
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,000
I hope you can keep your word.

194
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,720
Just do whatever you want.

195
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,840
You'll win her heart or not. That's another story.

196
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,480
Moei might already have someone she likes.

197
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,120
Hey!

198
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,720
Thian.

199
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,239
It got into my eyes.

200
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,400
It serves you right.

201
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,160
Didn't I warn you not to compete with Kob?

202
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,400
Are you rubbing salt in my wound?

203
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,360
No, I'm not.

204
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,920
I'm just worried about you.

205
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,760
That's not true.

206
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,840
I heard you cheered for him so loudly.

207
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,400
He won the game. And here you are.

208
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,320
So happy about it?

209
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,520
Kob may won the game.

210
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,080
But the only one who won my heart

211
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,680
is you.

212
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,080
I don't care whether you win or lose.

213
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,520
No matter what,

214
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm completely enrolled into Thian Religion.

215
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,960
And I'll never change my mind.

216
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,600
Whoa, Moei.

217
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,640
What about you?

218
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,440
When will you fall for me?

219
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,760
I'm getting tired of courting you.

220
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Do you know that?

221
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,920
Let go of me.

222
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,840
Stop courting me if you're tired.

223
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,240
And stop your nonsense.

224
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,000
- It's annoying. - It's tiring but I want to.

225
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,280
Can I?

226
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
Then stop complaining.

227
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,760
That's a yes, right?

228
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,920
Why are you blushing?

229
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,000
Who's blushing?

230
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,160
You can blush, you know?

231
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,760
You already have your spot in my heart.

232
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,119
Hey, Thian.

233
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,520
Are you still sane, man?

234
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,959
Why are you smiling?

235
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,200
We just lost the game.

236
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Hang on.

237
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,359
Could it be when he fell earlier?

238
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,640
He might have hit his head too hard.

239
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,400
- I think he's... - Leave me alone.

240
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,679
- What? - He heard you.

241
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,040
What's the matter with him?

242
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,920
I guess he couldn't admit the defeat.

243
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,599
So he goes a little ding-dong, a little wacky.

244
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,279
- Is he gone insane? - Yeah.

245
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,720
- Oh, Thian. - Hey!

246
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,880
Why don't you talk to me?

247
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,600
Stop caring for your bruise.

248
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,480
I'll be back. Enjoy your snack.

249
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,760
Are you ding-dong, too?

250
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,360
He also hit his head.

251
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,640
Nott.

252
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,160
I saw you fell earlier.

253
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,680
- Are you hurt? Let me see. - I am fine.

254
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,560
- Let me see. - Watch out.

255
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,800
Come, I'll patch you up.

256
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,999
It's all right. I can do it myself.

257
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,320
Do as I say. Sit here.

258
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,960
It will sting a bit.

259
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,720
It's done.

260
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,800
Thank you.

261
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,360
You're welcome.

262
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,920
So, are we good now?

263
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm sorry. Forgive me, okay?

264
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,040
Let's make peace. I just patched you up.

265
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,600
- Let's hook pinkies. - Hey.

266
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,880
Come on.

267
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,600
Don't be sulky. Let's make peace.

268
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,440
- Are we good? - All right.

269
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,600
Hammoc!

270
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Hammoc!

271
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:53,720
Hammoc the Winner!

272
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Hey!

273
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,760
- Hey, Hammoc! - Who's calling?

274
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,120
You fell over?

275
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,560
- What the heck? - What's this?

276
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Can you drink somewhere else? I'm trying to sleep here.

277
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,600
Hey, wait.

278
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
I'm afraid we can't move, the skinny girl.

279
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,520
As we're celebrating our victory.

280
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,720
So how was it?

281
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,480
Can you see now how better we are than your boss?

282
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,840
I'm freaking good, right?

283
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,320
- Want some beer? - No!

284
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,160
At least, my Thian could score a goal.

285
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
Unlike someone here.

286
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,559
What a crap!

287
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,199
You want to get slapped, aren't you?

288
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,560
Just get out of here.

289
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,480
- Get out of here. - Hammoc totally sucks.

290
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
What did you say? Gosh!

291
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,119
- Hey, Kang. - What?

292
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,800
Let me give you an advice.

293
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,719
Stop arguing with her.

294
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,400
Just hook up with her already.

295
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,839
Watch it, will you?

296
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,360
That will never happen.

297
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,920
You'll get a wife soon.

298
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,800
Stop it, Tum.

299
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,439
Stop that nonsense.

300
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,560
Who would want a woman like that as a wife?

301
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Kang.

302
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,440
Just tell me the truth.

303
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,720
You have a crush on Kaofang, right?

304
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,359
No, I don't.

305
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,519
Who would like that wacky woman? That's crazy.

306
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,840
Really?

307
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,600
You guys, stop it.

308
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,279
- She's blushing. - She is annoying.

309
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,160
A completely nerve wracking

310
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,600
who keeps chasing Thian everywhere. That's crazy.

311
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,960
You wait and see.

312
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,480
You'll soon see the punishment for those losers.

313
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,760
Hang on a second.

314
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,000
There's a punishment, too?

315
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,440
Of course.

316
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,040
So that's the punishment?

317
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,320
That's right.

318
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,360
Me, too.

319
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,640
Take a lot of pictures.

320
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,640
Hang on, everyone.

321
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,359
Actually we are.

322
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,000
"The Four Power Rangers"

323
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,520
to conquer all girls' hearts.

324
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,120
"cha-nor kin-mya go chit-teh", Boss.

325
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,200
I'm not playing with you.

326
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,760
You'd better be more careful.

327
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
You could just say it.

328
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,679
No need to secure it with hands.

329
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,720
Look.

330
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,800
I am well-prepared.

331
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
Yes, you are.

332
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,520
Are you securing it

333
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,520
or pulling it off?

334
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,799
I just want to test if it's tight enough.

335
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,840
Let go of me.

336
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Let go.

337
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,800
It's falling off now.

338
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,400
Let go now.

339
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Thian, Moei.

340
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,520
What are you doing?

341
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,800
Are you playing tug of war?

342
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,480
He's so clumsy. He tripped over a stone.

343
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,879
Luckily, I got him in time.

344
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,560
Otherwise he'd go flat on the ground.

345
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,680
You're really helpful.

346
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,320
Just go soft on her.

347
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,960
- You're a crafty one. - You're a handsome one.

348
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,680
Why are you smiling?

349
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,680
- Follow me. - Thian.

350
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,800
I think you should wear sarong more often.

351
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,640
So the floor will be cleaner.

352
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,920
How so?

353
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,720
Everyone says

354
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,840
your good look sweeps away all the dust.

355
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,320
You're teasing me again.

356
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,000
Just admit it. I'm good at courting men, right?

357
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,919
One day you'll fall for me

358
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,680
and welcome little mite and louse to the family.

359
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,680
Do you think you could give birth to twins

360
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,040
without my consent?

361
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,920
According to physiology,

362
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
it's unlikely for a man to be raped by a woman.

363
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,640
If the man doesn't want to cooperate,

364
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,479
he may play a little hard to get,

365
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,920
or even resist the woman.

366
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,200
Really? What if...

367
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,680
I got you all drunk. Would you cooperate?

368
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,400
I guess you read too many novels.

369
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,440
Drunk men will just fall asleep.

370
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,320
There's no way you'll see my thigh so easily.

371
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,320
That's a pity.

372
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,520
So I'll use every trick, by hook or by crook,

373
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,120
I'll use even magic if I may.

374
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Thian.

375
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,520
It's a holiday tomorrow.

376
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
How about we go and make merit together?

377
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,840
So we'll meet each other again in next life.

378
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,480
No way.

379
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,999
That's enough for me to see you in this life.

380
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,040
Get in the car.

381
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,240
Only in this life? Really?

382
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,840
Moei.

383
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,840
Why did you take it out? Put it away.

384
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,040
Thian. No!

385
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Come here.

386
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,240
- Give me that. - No.

387
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,600
- Give me that. - No.

388
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,599
- You have to come with me - All right. I'll come.

389
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,840
- Okay, I'll come. - Yeah? Go where?

390
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,840
To temple and make merit with me?

391
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,160
All right. I'll come.

392
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,560
Here we are.

393
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,920
Mingalaba.

394
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,200
Am I pretty?

395
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Well.

396
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,240
Not so bad.

397
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Come on.

398
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,320
You never complimented me.

399
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,240
I do it to you all the time.

400
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,920
Want my compliment?

401
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,160
You want a compliment. I'll give you as you wish.

402
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,480
So pretty like a deity from heaven.

403
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,240
Like an angel who hit her face on the ground.

404
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,040
Like a goose who thinks she's a swan.

405
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,760
That's not all.

406
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,840
So pretty like a survivor from war zone.

407
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,840
Like a fish hit the edge while escaping.

408
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,760
With lights off, trust me, you will be prettier.

409
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,160
Warty pretty, crappy pretty, that's all you.

410
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Satisfied?

411
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Thian.

412
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,840
I'd feel much better if you didn't say such words.

413
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,160
You asked for a compliment.

414
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,600
I gave you a compliment.

415
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
What's that?

416
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
Hey.

417
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
No!

418
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,639
Come here.

419
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,880
Do I really have to wear it?

420
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Come here.

421
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,400
I got me nearly fall over.

422
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Fine, I'll wear it.

423
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,880
Can I not wear it?

424
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,400
You have to.

425
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,840
You know how to wear it?

426
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,000
Of course I do.

427
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Are we done?

428
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,760
Come on.

429
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,800
Catch up with me.

430
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,080
Thian.

431
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,920
Thian.

432
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,880
Where are you going? We have to go that way.

433
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,160
Hey.

434
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,680
We have to go this way, not that way.

435
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,600
Thian.

436
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,520
Can you slow down a bit?

437
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
- Aren't you in a hurry? - No.

438
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,520
- Just slow down. - Okay.

439
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,599
Thian.

440
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,040
I said slower, not faster.

441
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,840
Oh, wow.

442
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,600
Hang on a second.

443
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,320
Oh my goodness.

444
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,160
What are you up to?

445
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,400
You got all dressed up.

446
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,120
Don't tell me you want to ask Moei out.

447
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,360
I want to ask her to join me to the market.

448
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,640
- Where's she? - She's not here.

449
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,240
She just left with Thian.

450
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,280
You should have come a little earlier.

451
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,840
Just a sec. I can accompany you.

452
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,160
That's all right, Tum.

453
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,320
I'm not going anywhere.

454
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,280
No?

455
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,320
Come on.

456
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,280
- One combo set. - Huh?

457
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,440
You already got it.

458
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,480
It's not enough. One combo set.

459
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,240
Just let me buy it, Thian.

460
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,640
- Why need so many? - It's different version.

461
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,799
- I'm going now. - Thian.

462
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,080
Wait up.

463
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,960
Thian.

464
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,440
What now?

465
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,360
Can I borrow some money?

466
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
I forgot my wallet.

467
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,280
- You're really... - Whoa!

468
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Please.

469
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,120
How much?

470
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,519
- One? - 1,000 kyat.

471
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,560
Just give it to me.

472
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,759
Just give me your wallet. I'll take care of it.

473
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,240
I have a lot to buy.

474
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,000
For your convenience, let me take hold of it.

475
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,520
Come on.

476
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,280
Oh, I'm so hungry.

477
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,640
Mingalaba.

478
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,240
Three.

479
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,240
- Mingalaba. - Mingalaba.

480
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,400
Two.

481
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,760
And...

482
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,120
- How many should we get? - And?

483
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,759
- That's enough. - Just a few more.

484
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,080
I'll take two.

485
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,960
We get one each.

486
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,520
Okay.

487
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,920
Let's go.

488
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,760
Thian.

489
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,720
What now?

490
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,680
It's Roti.

491
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,200
Myanmar Roti.

492
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,800
Let's make it.

493
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,680
You make it.

494
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,160
Let's make it together.

495
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,520
Thian.

496
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,720
Aren't you hungry?

497
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,960
Or...

498
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,680
you're already full just looking at me?

499
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,400
Making fun of me?

500
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,360
Give me back my wallet.

501
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,960
Stingy.

502
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,800
Of course I am.

503
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
You're spending like it's your own.

504
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Give me.

505
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,200
Give me.

506
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,160
You're my pet now?

507
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,560
Give me now.

508
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,960
Fine, I'll return it.

509
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,120
Can't I keep it?

510
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,640
Give me. Come on.

511
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,680
What is this?

512
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,560
You're a real new star in the industry.

513
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,080
- What star? - Spending Star.

514
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,120
You didn't only drag me out here,

515
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,360
you also spent my money.

516
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,040
Look, my Thai baht, my dollar, my kyat.

517
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,520
- You nearly spent all. - You still have much.

518
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,200
This won't be enough now.

519
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,040
We have to stay here for days, for weeks.

520
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,800
We'll be fine. Trust me.

521
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,240
We may have no money.

522
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,080
But after making merit, we'll be full of merits.

523
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,200
But if you aren't full yet,

524
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,400
I'll send my merits to you.

525
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,240
You can just wait and receive it.

526
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,159
I'm not a hungry ghost who receives merits from the living.

527
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,680
Here, take this.

528
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,440
I carried it all the way here.

529
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,840
Is that Moei and Tec Thian?

530
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,720
- Come here. - Who the heck?

531
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,080
Let go of me!

532
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,840
It's you. Let go of me!

533
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,120
Stop moving. You have to come with me.

534
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,400
- Come on. - Where to?

535
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,120
- I'm not going. - You have to pay Auntie.

536
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,480
What Auntie? Pay for what?

537
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,240
Are you drunk?

538
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,000
Here, see?

539
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,480
It's Tanaka.

540
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,720
You took it and ran.

541
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,400
I'm going now.

542
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,200
- What does she say? - Just pay her.

543
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,440
- Why made such a fuss? - Sorry, sorry.

544
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,560
I'm so sorry.

545
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,120
Pay more.

546
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,360
What? What?

547
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,720
What now?

548
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,040
Can you pay for me?

549
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,360
You come to the market with no money?

550
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,240
- Just pay it for me first. - Gosh!

551
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,439
Fine!

552
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,000
Wait, sorry.

553
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
Just a second.

554
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
Wow.

555
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
Hey.

556
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,560
You spend your past time as a thief?

557
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,279
I'll pay you back later.

558
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,680
I just didn't bring enough.

559
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,200
- I'm going now. - Hey!

560
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,720
- What now? - Where do you think you're going?

561
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,440
- What? - You owe me now.

562
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,160
So you have to go sightseeing with me.

563
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,319
Sightseeing?

564
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,160
- Of course. Follow me, pretty girl. - I'm not going.

565
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,319
You want me to summon Auntie?

566
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,400
You want that?

567
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,680
- Hey. - Whoa!

568
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,320
Chet.

569
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,960
Why are you sitting all alone? No friends?

570
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,480
Sort of.

571
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,080
Thian is with Moei to the temple.

572
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,600
Beer is taking a nap.

573
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,680
Toon is video-calling with his wife.

574
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
So here I am.

575
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,520
I'm alone, too.

576
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,840
Let's go sightseeing.

577
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Thian.

578
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,920
Are you knocking the bells?

579
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,240
No.

580
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,760
Thian.

581
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,520
Can you see the shadow of the tip of the pagoda?

582
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,680
Yes.

583
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,160
The myth says that

584
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,080
this well was made for the king

585
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,040
when he came to pay respect to the pagoda.

586
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,840
The king always had the crown on, right?

587
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,200
So it wasn't easy for him to look up or down.

588
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,400
And it's suitable for you, too.

589
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,000
Since you always hold you head up high.

590
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,560
You're arrogant and overly proud.

591
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,760
All right. Let's make a wish.

592
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,640
- Mingalaba. - Mingalaba.

593
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,520
Thian, just a second.

594
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,800
You're putting more of it?

595
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,520
What are you doing?

596
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,920
Don't wipe it off.

597
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,680
Leave it like this.

598
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,240
It keeps your face cool. No melasma.

599
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,879
I can't say no, right?

600
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,280
You're learning.

601
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,640
That's right.

602
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,880
Moei.

603
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,640
Having fun?

604
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,040
I'm having so much fun.

605
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,879
Go, go to her.

606
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,440
No! Don't come to me.

607
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,200
Why do you have to visit many temples?

608
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,360
How about just one more?

609
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,880
No. Don't you know

610
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,960
each temple has different holy power?

611
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,680
No, I don't.

612
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,840
I'm not Miss know-it-all like you.

613
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,200
All right. I'll tell you.

614
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,840
You can ask for jobs in some temples.

615
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,120
Some you can ask for money.

616
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,959
Some for health.

617
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,880
Since we're making merits today,

618
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,600
let's just ask for success in all aspects.

619
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,600
You're some needy girl.

620
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,920
What about this temple? What do you ask for?

621
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,880
Love.

622
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,160
In every temple after this,

623
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,560
I'll only ask for love.

624
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,680
They say this pagoda is really sacred.

625
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,160
It symbolizes some kind of love.

626
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,360
I am not sure about it.

627
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,880
I just heard from others.

628
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,280
They say if a couple come to make a wish here,

629
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,160
their wish will be fulfilled.

630
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,400
They will never part each other.

631
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,520
Thian. People say if you look at this Buddha statue from afar,

632
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,560
it will look like he's smiling.

633
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,279
But if you look closely,

634
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,640
he will look grumpy.

635
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,480
Unlike you at all.

636
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,079
Whether far or near,

637
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,760
you always look grumpy.

638
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,440
Just kidding.

639
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,920
Thian.

640
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,920
Thank you.

641
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,880
May he not be so harsh to me.

642
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,120
But may he loves me for a long time.

643
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,360
Just kidding.

644
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,280
Shwedagon Pagoda.

645
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,080
It's so beautiful.

646
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,440
- Yes. - What a pity it's still under renovation.

647
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,280
Here it is.

648
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,080
Your personal Buddha statue.

649
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,200
For Friday-born people.

650
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,160
You remember my birthday?

651
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,840
Of course.

652
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,560
What about you? Do you remember mine?

653
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,840
Of course, I don't.

654
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,520
If my guess were a lottery, I would surely win.

655
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,800
I knew you never remembered my birthday.

656
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,160
I was born on Monday.

657
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,400
Remember it.

658
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,120
I'll go and pay respect to mine as well.

659
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,600
I'll be back.

660
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,640
Now, we'll move on to the next holy spot.

661
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,519
The Great Tiger and the Great Lion.

662
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,800
There's a belief about these statues.

663
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,760
If you love someone,

664
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,240
put the photo of the person you love

665
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,559
in mouth of the Great Tiger or the Great Lion.

666
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,880
And your wish will be fulfilled.

667
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,120
- Excuse me. - Yes?

668
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,080
We can put it in either the Tiger or the Lion?

669
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,160
No. For the woman,

670
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,200
put the man's photo in the Tiger's mouth.

671
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,160
For a man, put a woman's photo is the Lion's.

672
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,680
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

673
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,800
Hey.

674
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,800
Why are you asking him? Are you with them?

675
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,880
No.

676
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,040
Thian.

677
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,600
I'll go to the restroom.

678
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,280
- Okay. - I'll be right back.

679
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,000
I wish to have a happy love life with Thian.

680
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,600
If my wish is fulfilled,

681
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,200
I'll come back again to pay respect to you.

682
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,880
Thian.

683
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,640
Actually, the prayer earlier was a curse.

684
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,920
You can only lift the curse by translating it.

685
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,920
I'll give you a hint.

686
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,119
I already sent you Thai version.

687
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,320
What?

688
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,480
It's a poem.

689
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
Thank you.

690
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,440
You have to try remembering it.

691
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,040
However, I'll give you only one chance.

692
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,440
If you get it correctly, I'll...

693
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,800
Sign a divorce paper?

694
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,800
Not a chance.

695
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,720
I'll return the marriage certificate to you.

696
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,200
Hey.

697
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,320
I don't want the marriage certificate.

698
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,200
I want a signed divorce paper.

699
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:05,480
Finally, we are here in the biggest lake of Myanmar.

700
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,520
Look over there.

701
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,960
- Pondej is missing? - Yes.

702
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,320
My people searched for him everywhere.

703
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,520
But no luck at all.

704
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,160
He must be on a run and is hiding somewhere.

705
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,560
I'm telling you this so you can be at ease.

706
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,920
Don't have to worry about Thian.

707
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,240
So I don't have to stay in Dawei anymore?

708
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,640
That's right.

709
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,600
You have sacrificed so much for Thian.

710
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,920
It's time for you to do things for yourself.

711
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,080
I want to see you happy.

712
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,760
About the things you asked me,

713
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,520
I have arranged everything.

714
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,200
You have only the paperwork to do.

715
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,200
I think it's time for you to come back.

716
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,720
I'm fear Pondej might show up here.

717
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,520
You don't have to worry about that.

718
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,920
Ri has confirmed he would take care of Thian.

719
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,600
He also agreed that you should come back.

720
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,160
I promise you.

721
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,840
No one can ever hurt Thian again.

722
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,000
All right.

723
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,440
To all sacred power,

724
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,360
my duty is about to complete soon.

725
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,120
From now on,

726
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,720
when I am not around Thian anymore,

727
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,000
I wish him save from all kind of dangers.

728
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,800
May he be happy and prosperous.

729
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,680
May he find a stable and sustainable love.

730
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,520
May that person

731
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,400
be a decent one who deserves his love.

732
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,640
Even though it was short time,

733
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,800
I'm really thankful for the opportunity

734
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,000
for me to be married

735
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,720
and spending my life with Thian.

736
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,360
As I have always wished.

737
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,080
I was born with little merit in this life.

738
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,800
I am nothing to deserve him.

739
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,080
If next life really exists,

740
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,080
may I be born beautiful inside and out.

741
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,000
May Thian fall deeply for me.

742
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,120
Look at him while you can, Moei.

743
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,560
As you may never have this chance ever again.

744
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,200
Wow.

745
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,079
It's so beautiful.

746
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,360
Look over there.

747
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,120
Are you planning to kill me in the woods?

748
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,640
Why aren't we there yet?

749
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,720
We're almost there.

750
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,440
You already said that a few times .

751
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,800
I'm not going anywhere.

752
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,480
- I'm heading back. - Hang on, Thian.

753
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,080
So is this beauty worth the long walk?

754
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,520
Let's take a photo together.

755
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,320
Why bother?

756
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,400
I see you every day.

757
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,400
But we have no photo together.

758
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,400
I've known you since I was young.

759
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,960
But we have never taken a photo together.

760
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,720
Can I have just one photo as a souvenir?

761
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,520
- Thian, watch out! - Moei!

762
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,200
Moei.

763
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,960
Moei!

764
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,040
Moei!

765
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,800
Where's my sister?

766
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,920
- Where's my sister? - No.

767
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,240
- Where is she? - No.

768
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,440
Moei!

769
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,640
Moei!

770
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,920
Moei!

771
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,640
Moei!

772
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,640
Moei.

773
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,680
Moei. Moei.

774
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,920
Thian.

775
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,200
Moei.

776
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,440
Don't be scared.

777
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,920
It hurts so much.

778
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,840
Hang in there, Moei.

779
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,880
Where's my phone?

780
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,640
Damn it.

781
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,600
Moei.

782
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,920
Moei.

783
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,400
Moei, open your eyes.

784
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,480
Moei.

785
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,640
Look at me, Moei.

786
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,200
Look at me.

787
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,440
Moei.

788
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,639
Moei. Come on.

789
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,880
Open your eyes.

790
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,520
Talk to me, Moei.

791
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,680
Moei.

792
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,280
Moei, wake up.

793
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,560
Help!

794
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,880
Moei.

795
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,280
Moei, you're gonna be okay.

796
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,600
Hang in there, Moei.

797
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,040
Just hang in there.

798
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,360
Look at me.

799
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,560
- Look at me. - This way.

800
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,920
This way, please.

801
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,080
You can speak Thai?

802
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,560
Yes.

803
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,520
- Please, get her inside first. - Okay, let's go.

804
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,080
Moei.

805
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,720
You're gonna be all right, Moei.

806
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,840
Moei.

807
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,640
Open your eyes, Moei.

808
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,680
Mister.

809
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,240
She needs a doctor.

810
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,560
There's no doctor here.

811
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,720
What?

812
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,400
Why did he bring us here?

813
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,199
We need a doctor.

814
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,960
Can't you see my wife is badly injured?

815
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,560
It's the best option here.

816
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,520
The hospital is about 100 km from here.

817
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,880
Your wife is bleeding too much.

818
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,640
We need to stop the bleeding.

819
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,280
Moei, just hang in there.

820
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,560
Moei.

821
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,000
You're gonna be fine.

822
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,320
Mister.

823
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,600
Do you have a phone?

824
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,600
I wonder where Thian and Moei are now.

825
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,840
They must be in a paradise somewhere.

826
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,920
In the paradise. Hey! Hey!

827
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,240
Paradise what?!

828
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,240
- What? - This is serious, man.

829
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,919
I don't want you stressed out.

830
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,120
I'm worried, too.

831
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,720
Hope nothing bad happened.

832
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,680
It's already past nine o'clock.

833
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,080
They should have come back now.

834
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,240
You're right. Where the heck are they?

835
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:09,840
Who's this?

836
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,760
Just answer it.

837
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,840
Who's calling now?

838
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,680
Hello? Who's this?

839
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,720
Thian?

840
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,320
How's he?

841
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,520
Where are you?

842
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,360
- Doctor! - Doctor!

843
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,680
- Doctor! - Doctor!

844
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,840
- Doctor! - Doctor!

845
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,440
- Doctor! - Doctor!

846
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,520
- Doctor! - Doctor!

847
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,560
Doctor!

848
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,720
Here.

849
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,320
Talk.

850
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,360
Yes?

851
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,880
The first thing you must do now

852
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,600
is to stop the bleeding.

853
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,000
If she's still bleeding,

854
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,440
lift the injured part over the heart level.

855
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,280
Check if she's got a fever.

856
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,880
From what you told me,

857
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,360
she's losing too much blood.

858
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,880
If she has a high fever,

859
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,240
she may go into shock.

860
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,360
All right.

861
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,880
I got it now, thank you.

862
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,760
- Hello? - Beer.

863
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,360
You guys stay put. I've talked to the doctor.

864
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,600
I'll call you again later.

865
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,960
Don't tell anyone. They may be too panicked.

866
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,600
- I'll hang up now. - What about...

867
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,920
Hello?

868
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,080
Hello?

869
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,320
Thank you.

870
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,320
You're gonna be all right.

871
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,960
I've talked to the doctor.

872
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,120
You're gonna be okay. Just hang in there, okay?

873
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,800
I've brought you some clothes.

874
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,880
Thank you.

875
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,320
If she's still bleeding,

876
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,720
lift the injured part over the heart level.

877
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,160
No, Moei. You were just fine this morning.

878
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,680
Calm down, Tum.

879
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,600
Moei isn't dead yet.

880
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,959
We're taking just fine this morning.

881
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,360
Who would've thought something bad would happen?

882
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,400
I just don't want anything to happen to her.

883
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,280
Don't be dramatic. Stop crying.

884
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,720
- Don't cry. - Where are they now?

885
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,840
I'll help find the way to bring them back.

886
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,880
Right.

887
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,760
I don't know.

888
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,360
Thian didn't tell me.

889
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,119
You aren't worry about that.

890
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,880
Thian can surely take good care of Moei.

891
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,480
He only asked for all of you to keep your mouth shut

892
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,760
about them gone missing.

893
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,240
He doesn't want to cause panic.

894
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,760
Got it?

895
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,200
Hey.

896
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,480
Kob.

897
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,240
Are you okay?

898
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,560
Yeah.

899
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,280
I don't think he is.

900
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,280
He surely isn't.

901
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,720
- It was beautiful. - It was fun, too.

902
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,920
I loved it.

903
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,200
All right, we're here.

904
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,080
- I'm going now. - All right.

905
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,120
Beer, Toon, good night.

906
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,240
- Good night. - Good night.

907
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,480
- Good night. - Good night.

908
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,039
Where's Thian?

909
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,080
Is he back?

910
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,280
- Not yet? - Right.

911
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,720
Moei.

912
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,480
Moei.

913
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,200
Check if she's got a fever.

914
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,120
From what you told me,

915
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,520
she's losing too much blood.

916
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,920
If she has a high fever,

917
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,280
she may go into shock.

918
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,160
Yes?

919
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,040
I think this belongs to your wife.

920
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,560
The driver brought it just now.

921
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,920
- Thank you. - All right.

922
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,840
Your eyes are like stars shining bright.

923
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,480
That makes me blind and love you like crazy.

924
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,400
I wonder where your heart longs to be.

925
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,840
Since you never look at me or anyone.

926
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,200
When or how I fell for you.

927
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,200
I had no idea.

928
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,080
All I know is my heart is with you.

929
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,360
Never complain doesn't mean no misery.

930
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:42,320
No tears doesn't mean no feeling.

931
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,840
I want to smile and laugh my best with him.

932
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,520
As I never know when it will be the last time.

933
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,120
It's fine if you don't love me.

934
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,080
Just don't disappear from me forever.

935
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,160
Can you not cause any more pain?

936
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,120
Moei.

937
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,080
Moei.

938
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,920
She still has a fever.

939
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,440
Thian.

940
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,680
Moei.

941
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,760
Moei.

942
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,840
How are you feeling?

943
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,000
You have no fever now.

944
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,680
Thian.

945
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,200
Let me explain. Well, last night...

946
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,400
- I had to bring the temperature down. - Thian.

947
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,400
You don't have to explain.

948
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,920
Just get me my clothes.

949
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,800
All right. I'll bring it to you.

950
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,320
This should be okay. I borrowed them from the local people.

951
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,200
I...

952
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,160
need to change.

953
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,080
Okay.

954
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,400
Moei.

955
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,440
Can you really walk?

956
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,600
I am fine now.

957
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,160
You're showing off again.

958
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,800
Want to sit over there?

959
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,520
How do you feel now?

960
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,040
Feeling better?

961
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,680
Thank you very much.

962
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,080
If it weren't for you,

963
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,880
I wouldn't be here today.

964
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,360
I am also...

965
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:39,920
sorry.

966
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,160
If I hadn't taken you to see the sunset,

967
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,640
we wouldn't have got into that accident.

968
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,640
You don't need to apologize.

969
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,160
Because seeing that sunset

970
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,560
was the best.

971
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,280
I would have regretted it if I hadn't been there.

972
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,320
Sit here.

973
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,960
What is it?

974
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,720
Can you...

975
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,000
stop making me fall for you?

976
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,760
Right now,

977
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,640
the hole I fell into

978
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,640
is already deep.

979
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,280
Falling into it too often,

980
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,480
it hurts, you know?

981
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,960
You're talking like this.

982
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,640
You must be fine now.

983
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,680
You stay here.

984
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,760
I'll take down the net.

985
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,839
Does everyone know?

986
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,800
We were out the whole night.

987
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,040
Have you told everyone?

988
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,320
What about Ri and Mon?

989
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,000
Do they know?

990
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,400
Ri and Mon don't know yet.

991
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,720
That's a relief.

992
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,200
You can't let both of them know.

993
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,680
If Aunt Sajee finds out,

994
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,120
I can't even imagine it.

995
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,920
I know that.

996
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,480
Thian.

997
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
What is it?

998
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,880
What gag are you pulling now?

999
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,680
How about you change your shirt?

1000
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,560
You look like a complete mess.

1001
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,400
Don't you think?

1002
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,080
Yeah.

1003
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,960
Mingalaba.

1004
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,960
Oh.

1005
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,120
Moei.

1006
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,240
Why didn't you say something?

1007
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,800
Thian.

1008
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,440
Shouldn't you let me out first?

1009
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,400
I don't want to look, you know?

1010
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,120
Okay, out.

1011
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,080
Go out.

1012
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,640
You're funny.

1013
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,600
Thian.

1014
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,840
You're internationally popular now.

1015
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,040
A Myanmar heartthrob.

1016
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,640
Come on, Thian. Since you've come this far,

1017
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,360
show them your sexy abs.

1018
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,320
Repay them for helping us.

1019
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,120
Hey.

1020
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,080
You're supposed to protect your husband.

1021
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,920
Not asking me to show my abs like this.

1022
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,880
Husband.

1023
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,200
I really like it

1024
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,880
when you call yourself "husband".

1025
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:22,160
I also heard you told the people here

1026
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,920
that I was your wife.

1027
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,720
I don't quite remember

1028
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,320
what I said.

1029
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,080
You also addressed yourself so sweetly to me.

1030
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,280
Really?

1031
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,800
Yeah.

1032
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,840
When did I say that?

1033
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,480
I really can't remember.

1034
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,160
And...

1035
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,240
you put your arms around me.

1036
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,080
Can you remember now?

1037
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,480
Can't I hold you for a bit?

1038
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,240
Protect me from Myanmar girls.

1039
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,040
Fine, I'll let go.

1040
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,760
Then just put your arm back here.

1041
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,960
Protect you from Myanmar girls.

1042
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,520
Thank you so much.

1043
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,280
If it weren't for your help, we'd be in bad situation.

1044
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,920
That's all right.

1045
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,200
Thai and Myanmar are like brothers.

1046
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,120
It's a pleasure we could help.

1047
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,400
Enjoy your meal.

1048
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,280
- Thank you. - Thank you very much.

1049
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,560
- Would you join us? - Thank you. It's all right.

1050
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,040
I'll eat with my family outside.

1051
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,480
Let's go.

1052
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,440
- Thank you. - Enjoy your meal.

1053
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,360
It's okay.

1054
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,760
Before we go back to the camp,

1055
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,920
I'll take you to the town

1056
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,200
see a doctor and have a checkup.

1057
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,760
To make sure you're okay.

1058
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:27,040
Hey.

1059
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,880
Why don't you wait for me?

1060
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,480
Come on.

1061
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,040
Let's go.

1062
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:55,640
Okay.

1063
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:02,520
Thian.

1064
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:08,080
I really thank you for accompanying me.

1065
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,280
I really had a great time.

1066
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,080
Bye.

1067
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,560
Thian.

1068
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,040
I really mean it.

1069
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,000
If you can translate the prayer correctly,

1070
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,880
you can have the marriage certificate back.

1071
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,000
Okay.

1072
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:19,440
But you only have time until tomorrow.

1073
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:20,760
Okay.

1074
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,360
- Just one day? - Yes.

1075
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,920
I don't have any more time.

1076
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,360
That's the deal.

1077
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,360
Bye.

1078
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,360
Gosh!

1079
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,799
Why keep asking?

1080
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,279
I said I don't know.

1081
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,480
Stop it already.

1082
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,640
How is that possible?

1083
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,640
You're her friend.

1084
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,800
You must know where those two have been to.

1085
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,680
Or...

1086
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:24,400
is there something I don't know?

1087
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:32,519
Are they really dating? If you want to know that much,

1088
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,160
why don't you ask them?

1089
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,560
Go ask Thian.

1090
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,520
Ask everything you want to know.

1091
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,160
Go.

1092
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,480
Go.

1093
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,760
Now you have no guts.

1094
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,240
How annoying.

1095
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,440
Who said I had no guts?

1096
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,920
Gosh! Kaofang is really a pain in the neck.

1097
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,480
I'm sure she'll do everything

1098
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,400
to find out about you and Thian.

1099
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,160
Just let her be.

1100
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,640
Hey, Moei.

1101
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,760
Why aren't you worried at all?

1102
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,040
Exactly.

1103
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,240
It's really fine. I'll leave soon anyway.

1104
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,440
What?

1105
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,760
Leave? Hang on a minute.

1106
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Where are you planning to go?

1107
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,000
You said this so many times.

1108
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,600
What are you up to exactly?

1109
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,000
Am I still your friend?

1110
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,360
Hey.

1111
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,440
Come on.

1112
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:51,520
I plan to tell you when the time is right.

1113
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:55,320
I've applied to study abroad.

1114
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,400
What?

1115
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:01,680
That's why I have to go back and prepare things.

1116
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,800
Hey, wait.

1117
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,520
I'm totally surprised.

1118
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,680
Hang on.

1119
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,360
Does Thian know about this?

1120
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,360
Well.

1121
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,400
I don't want to tell him.

1122
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,640
I don't want him to know.

1123
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,920
There, I knew it.

1124
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:29,280
That's why you dragged him out yesterday, right?

1125
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,680
It was a goodbye outing.

1126
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,080
Moei.

1127
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,640
Have you told Kob about this?

1128
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,960
I'll tell him.

1129
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:04,520
Moei.

1130
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:07,640
Moei.

1131
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,640
Are you all right?

1132
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,960
I'm fine now.

1133
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:18,720
I am sorry for disturbing your break time.

1134
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:20,720
It's all right.

1135
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,640
What is it you want to tell me?

1136
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,680
I...

1137
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,880
want to say goodbye.

1138
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,080
Where are you going?

1139
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,920
I'm leaving Dawei in two days.

1140
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,400
I've applied to study in America.

1141
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,480
I have to go back and prepare all documents

1142
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:51,040
and resign from the company.

1143
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,560
Why is it so sudden?

1144
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,880
Is something happening?

1145
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:58,440
Or...

1146
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,240
Is Thian bullying you?

1147
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,360
It's not that.

1148
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,360
Thian didn't bully me.

1149
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,960
And it's not sudden either.

1150
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,760
Actually, I applied for the course some time ago.

1151
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:17,080
But I just got accepted.

1152
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,240
Please do not doubt my intention to leave.

1153
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:29,800
I'll just leave everything behind.

1154
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:34,600
I think it's time for me to walk my own path.

1155
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,360
Are you saying

1156
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,160
you'll get a divorce?

1157
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,480
I want the marriage certificate back.

1158
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:39,840
- If only you can translate it within today by 6 pm. - Fine.

1159
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:42,399
Tonight, we will groom him

1160
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,000
and offer him at your door.

1161
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,960
If you agree to cooperate tonight,

1162
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,560
you'll get forever love for free

1163
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,720
with insurance of sustainability.

1164
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,960
And a lifetime guarantee.

1165
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,960
See you tonight.

1166
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,480
Husband Thian.
