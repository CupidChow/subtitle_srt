1
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,840
Pondej wants to have you and Natheerin killed.

2
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,880
Moei!

3
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,800
Moei, watch out!

4
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,719
Where are you taking her?

5
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,080
Let her study abroad.

6
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,640
It's her decision, not yours.

7
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,920
But I'm her husband.

8
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,039
Have you done anything to upset Thian?

9
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,080
I just...

10
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
- called off the wedding. - What?

11
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,720
Called off the wedding?

12
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,400
Do you want to leave be that badly?

13
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,320
Do you want to leave me that badly?

14
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,280
Have you forgotten

15
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,760
why I came here?

16
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,120
Pondej is no longer causing you trouble.

17
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,040
Let's get a divorce.

18
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,000
Arrange a vacation for Moei.

19
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm taking her back now.

20
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,599
If you still have a problem,

21
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,640
I'll let her resign like you once wanted.

22
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,080
I won't her leave.

23
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,520
I really don't get it.

24
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,319
I have all problems taken care of,

25
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,999
- what else do you want me to do? - You don't have to do anything.

26
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,919
I've decided that you can't take care of her.

27
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,760
If you had taken good care of her,

28
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,440
all of this wouldn't have happened.

29
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,159
Thian, I love Moei.

30
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,320
If she's not happy to be with you,

31
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,639
you should let her go

32
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,039
for the sake of her future.

33
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,640
But we're married, Mom.

34
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,240
- And she... - Are you sure?

35
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,480
Why you got married with her, don't you remember?

36
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
That's enough, Mom.

37
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,840
Don't bring this up anymore.

38
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,639
I admit I married her because someone wanted to kill me.

39
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,039
Why is that important?

40
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,559
Since I no longer want a divorce.

41
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,200
Hey, don't you ever think

42
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,720
that there was an easier way to solve that problem?

43
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,839
I only had to send someone to deal with them.

44
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,519
Then everything would end long ago.

45
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,600
Was it really necessary to force you to marry her?

46
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,320
On the day your car went into the water,

47
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,240
did you realize you forgot your phone at home?

48
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,440
Moei saw the message Pondej sent you.

49
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,240
She was so worried that she went after you secretly.

50
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,920
Why won't you let me bathe you?

51
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,480
- Moei. - Hmm?

52
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
I'm going out. Watch over the house, you two.

53
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,320
Where are you going?

54
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,320
(I know you're meeting my wife. Don't come if you don't want to die.)

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,560
Ri, Thian is in trouble.

56
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,040
Send me the location now.

57
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,680
Don't do anything just yet. I'm coming now.

58
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,160
- Okay. - Did something happen to Moei?

59
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,480
It's not Moei, Mom. It's Thian.

60
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,800
What?

61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
Boss, someone is here.

62
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Damn it! Let's go.

63
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,239
Moei then called a rescue team to help me.

64
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,639
And you put me on a silver platter and served her

65
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,959
to express your gratitude.

66
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
If you mean that, I already knew.

67
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,400
That's good, then. That's why I'm mad

68
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,039
when you sent her to Pondej at his company.

69
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,399
What if he remembered her and wanted to kill her?

70
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,039
Have you ever thought about that?

71
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,600
You never took care of her like she did to you.

72
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,760
That's why I want her back.

73
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,239
What about me saving her life? How didn't I take care good care of her?

74
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,439
You're really...

75
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,360
How dare you say that you saved her.

76
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,920
What you did was nothing compared to what she did for you.

77
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,559
You know what?

78
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,159
Besides calling the rescue team,

79
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,560
She jumped into the water to save you.

80
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,640
Miss!

81
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,440
Can you find him?

82
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,600
Hello, sir.

83
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,320
- Oh, hello. - Hello, sir.

84
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,239
- Where? Where did my son fall? - A car went into the water.

85
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,279
- I'm his mother. - Please calm down.

86
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,439
- Where is he? - A woman just jumped into the water

87
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,760
to help him.

88
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,280
- What? Moei. - They haven't come up yet.

89
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,440
- Thian. Moei. - Thian.

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Where are they?

91
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:34,159
- Mom, calm down. They'll be fine. - Can you find them?

92
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,720
Yes. They're right there.

93
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,360
Did you have any idea

94
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,600
how hard she tried to get you out of the water?

95
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,560
But unfortunately,

96
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,400
after she sent you over to the diver

97
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
who got you out of the water,

98
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,320
she lost her strength and nearly drowned.

99
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,280
- Oh, they found him. - They got one.

100
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,800
- Thian! - They found him, Mom.

101
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,400
They found him, Mother.

102
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,160
What about Moei?

103
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,320
- Thian. - Thian.

104
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,080
- Thian. - Thian.

105
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,240
- Thian. - Thian.

106
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,240
- Thian. - Thian.

107
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,880
Wake up, my boy.

108
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,720
- Thian. - Wake up and talk to me.

109
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,920
They're looking for Moei, Thian.

110
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,720
- Thian. - Thian.

111
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,719
Thian.

112
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,760
- Let them do their work. - Thian is safe now, Mom.

113
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,200
Mother, let them help him.

114
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,840
Thian, please wake up.

115
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
The water was very deep.

116
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,040
Your whole car went under.

117
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,120
The diver said they had to use the grapnel to pull it up.

118
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,240
And what about Moei...

119
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,440
The tide swept her away.

120
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,040
They couldn't find her.

121
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,920
By the time they pulled her out,

122
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,320
she had stopped breathing.

123
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,160
Mom, they found Moei.

124
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,280
- Moei. - Moei.

125
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,040
- Moei. - Moei.

126
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,280
Go check on her. Go.

127
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
- Mon, stay with mom. - Go now.

128
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,320
- One, two, three. - Moei.

129
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Moei.

130
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,680
- Please help her. - Moei.

131
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,520
Thian.

132
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
Thian, my boy. Moei.

133
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,120
They're in a doctor's care now. They are going to be all right, Mother.

134
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
Let's sit down, Mom. Come on.

135
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,120
What have I done to deserve this?

136
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,120
Mon.

137
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,959
Tell Sathit to arrange a flight

138
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,880
for Prapha to come here right away.

139
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,040
Yes, Mother.

140
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,440
Doctor.

141
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,160
- Doctor. - How are they doing, Doctor?

142
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,839
Both of them are safe now.

143
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,960
- Oh, my goodness. - Thank you, Doctor.

144
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,119
- Thank you so much. - Thank you so much.

145
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,360
Thank you so much, Doctor.

146
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,479
Once I knew that you two were safe,

147
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,760
I was so relieved and happy.

148
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,280
But I also felt very guilty as well.

149
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,920
Prapha.

150
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,000
Jee.

151
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,200
I'm so sorry.

152
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,120
Moei almost died because of Thian.

153
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,360
It's all right.

154
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,480
It's all right. It was an accident.

155
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm glad that Thian is safe now.

156
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,400
Okay, thank you so much.

157
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,200
I'm really grateful.

158
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,960
Why didn't anyone tell me?

159
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
Moei begged us

160
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,880
to keep this a secret.

161
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
Moei.

162
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Moei.

163
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,080
Moei.

164
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
Is Thian all right?

165
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,240
Thian is fine now, dear.

166
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,760
He's taking a rest now.

167
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,360
He's just a little hazy.

168
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,720
As he suffered a concussion.

169
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,360
I thank you so much, Moei,

170
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,600
for risking your life to save Thian's.

171
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,520
- Aunt Jee. - Yes, dear?

172
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,520
Can you not tell him

173
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,320
that I saved him?

174
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,640
Moei.

175
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,160
- Moei. - I'm here, Mom.

176
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,120
Can I go see Thian?

177
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,880
Aunt Jee said he started to ask for me.

178
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,880
I don't want him to know

179
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm staying in the room next to him.

180
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,800
Are you sure you're all right?

181
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,640
I'm all right, Mom.

182
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,600
Mom.

183
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,960
I can walk from here.

184
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,920
He might see me.

185
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,280
Will you be okay to walk?

186
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,720
Yes.

187
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,880
Hello, Aunt Jee.

188
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,520
Moei.

189
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,600
Look at her, Mom.

190
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,160
Where have you been?

191
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,400
What took you so long to show up?

192
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,640
You are mocking me.

193
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,639
I guess you're all right now.

194
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,599
Look at your grumpy little face.

195
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,280
Stop it now.

196
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,160
See? You're well now.

197
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,560
Since you're in the hospital, how about get a checkup?

198
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,120
Maybe your endorphins aren't working properly.

199
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,400
How come you're always in a good mood like this?

200
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,840
You still can laugh when I'm hospitalized like this.

201
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,720
Look, you're still smiling.

202
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
Well, you're not dead yet.

203
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,720
I assure you when you're dead, I'll cry for you.

204
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,480
You little...

205
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,160
Thian, are you hurt?

206
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,880
Of course I am.

207
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,240
It's not a cut on my finger to recover so soon.

208
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,600
How about this?

209
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,600
I'll pull 10 funny faces for you.

210
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,200
How?

211
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,280
The first one.

212
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,840
Is that funny?

213
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,240
Moei.

214
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,080
Why don't you take some rest?

215
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,240
It's all right, Aunt Jee.

216
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,640
I've had enough rest.

217
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,080
I'll go peel some fruits for you then.

218
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,840
Okay.

219
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,080
Moei.

220
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,800
Moei.

221
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,760
What? What is it?

222
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,560
What's wrong with Mom?

223
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,080
She must be happy that her son is recovered.

224
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,240
Really?

225
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,920
Yes.

226
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,120
So, where have you been?

227
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,120
Why visiting me just now?

228
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,560
Didn't Aunt Jee tell you

229
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,839
that I've been swamped with work lately?

230
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,360
My boss keeps pressuring me.

231
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,920
I've worked so hard that I'm so tired.

232
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,360
- I'm so dog-tired. - I see.

233
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,600
That's why you're as pale as a ghost.

234
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,440
Just keep working hard.

235
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,360
It's good I come when you are awake.

236
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,520
Otherwise, I'd miss talking to you.

237
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,599
I came to see you many times, you know?

238
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,680
But you were always asleep.

239
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Thian.

240
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
How about I tell you some funny stories?

241
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,920
You kept asking

242
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,280
what took her so long to visit you.

243
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,320
Actually, she didn't go anywhere.

244
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,480
She was in the room next to you.

245
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,200
The police officers said the water wasn't still.

246
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,320
The car could have been swept away

247
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,680
and couldn't be found.

248
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,200
If those who saved you

249
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,720
took action even for half a second slower,

250
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,400
your chance of survival would have been zero, Thian.

251
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,080
Moei was unlucky.

252
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,600
But it was my luck

253
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,640
that she decided to jump without hesitation

254
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,080
into the water to save you,

255
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
even when the water was opaque

256
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,400
and deep.

257
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,600
She said she couldn't see anything

258
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,720
and it was so difficult to find you.

259
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,919
Fortunately,

260
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,800
she got you out of the water.

261
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,720
Do you see now

262
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,960
why I had to give you to her?

263
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,160
Thank you so much, Moei

264
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,920
for risking your life to save Thian's.

265
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,440
Now that I know he's safe,

266
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,360
I'm okay now.

267
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,600
- Aunt Jee. - Yes, dear?

268
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,680
Can you not tell him

269
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,640
that I saved him?

270
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,400
I don't want him

271
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,240
to feel bad

272
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,920
that I saved him.

273
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,680
You want Moei to marry Thian?

274
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,640
She's the only one who can save him from that woman.

275
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,720
Will he agree to this?

276
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,360
He has no choice.

277
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,760
This time, he only has to do what I say.

278
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
I don't mean to be selfish.

279
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,919
For Moei sacrificed herself to save my son,

280
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,600
it's like she has given him a new life.

281
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,640
So, for the rest of his life,

282
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,080
I want him to be with a good woman

283
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,800
who sincerely loves and cares for him.

284
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,120
I am begging you.

285
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,080
Please let Moei be Thian's bride.

286
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I thank you so much, Aunt Jee,

287
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,400
for giving me an opportunity that day.

288
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,720
But now, that is all over.

289
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,639
Mom.

290
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,800
Are you asleep?

291
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,680
Not yet, dear.

292
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,520
How are you doing?

293
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,280
How was work today?

294
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,840
Did you fight with Thian again?

295
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,600
Don't bother him too much.

296
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,160
You know he doesn't like to be bothered.

297
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,040
I know.

298
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,760
I won't bother him.

299
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,040
Well, Mom.

300
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,360
If I...

301
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
really go abroad to study,

302
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,640
will you be fine by yourself?

303
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,080
We have been living separately

304
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,080
since you went to college.

305
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,520
I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.

306
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,800
All right.

307
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,239
Well, at first,

308
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,520
Aunt Jee said she would pay for everything.

309
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,200
But I've applied for a scholarship.

310
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,120
If I am granted,

311
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,159
I'd only ask her to support me

312
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
for my allowance and accommodation.

313
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,560
And while I'm there,

314
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,640
I think I'll find myself a part-time job, too.

315
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,360
What do you think?

316
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,680
That's good.

317
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,240
I think after I have graduated,

318
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,960
I'll definitely get a lucrative job.

319
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,080
Moei.

320
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,600
Are you really going to divorce Thian?

321
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,360
Yes.

322
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,800
Mom, I...

323
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,720
I'm sorry for what I did in the past.

324
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,600
I won't do it again.

325
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,200
I didn't think well

326
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,880
that if anything happened to me,

327
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,480
how you would live.

328
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
How many times will you keep apologizing?

329
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,280
You only did what you felt like.

330
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,240
If you love someone so much,

331
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,679
it's natural that you'll sacrifice everything for that person,

332
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,360
even your life.

333
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,799
Just like how your dad sacrificed himself

334
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,920
and slid his side of the car into the tree during the accident

335
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,040
to let you and I could live until today.

336
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,400
Don't be sad and don't blame yourself anymore.

337
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,960
You're a good child.

338
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,120
In the future, you'll get to meet good people.

339
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Yes, Mom.

340
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,960
Mom, when we meet next week,

341
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,599
can you cook my favorite dishes?

342
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,880
Of course.

343
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,480
See you, my dear.

344
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,560
What is it that ties you up

345
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,240
and keeps you from falling for anyone else

346
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,480
but Thian?

347
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,480
Love is always important.

348
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,160
But there are always more important things.

349
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,000
And if in this life,

350
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,520
Thian and I are not meant to be together,

351
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,720
I hope I can forget him soon.

352
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,000
And I hope.

353
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,240
I won't suffer from love anymore.

354
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,600
Moei.

355
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,200
I know everything now.

356
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,520
About how you nearly drowned

357
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,880
to save me.

358
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,000
I'd like to thank you and apologize to you.

359
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,800
Thank you for letting me live

360
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,280
so I can learn what love is.

361
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,080
It made me realize

362
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,640
that we can miss someone

363
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,760
even when we're right by their side.

364
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,600
I thank you for sacrificing your own happiness

365
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,720
to marry a guy like me,

366
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,560
a guy who hurt your feeling,

367
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,360
a guy who never cared about you

368
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,040
or cherished your heart.

369
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,520
And...

370
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,640
I thank you for loving me this much.

371
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,840
I won't doubt your love anymore.

372
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,400
I promise.

373
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,920
I'm sorry, Moei.

374
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,760
I'm sorry for always giving you hard times.

375
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,520
I'm sorry for being mean to you.

376
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,480
And I'm sorry

377
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,400
for never seeing your love at all.

378
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,960
Right now, I feel so guilty

379
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,960
that I can't face you anymore.

380
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,640
Now I've made up my mind I'll let you go,

381
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,240
so you can continue your studies as you want.

382
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,520
But I won't approve your resignation.

383
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,560
I'll let you leave without pay.

384
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,960
As for the divorce paper,

385
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,000
I've signed it for you.

386
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,360
This is the one thing.

387
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,560
I can do for you.

388
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,240
I promise I won't call or contact you.

389
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,199
I believe that time

390
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,320
will eventually melt away the guilt in my heart.

391
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,200
And I hope during the time we are apart.

392
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,680
I will learn...

393
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,080
Where is Thian?

394
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,960
Moei, don't you know he has left?

395
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,080
What?

396
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,440
Where is he going?

397
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,080
Please tell me, Beer, Nott, Toon.

398
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,160
Where is he going?

399
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,400
He's going to Hong Kong.

400
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,240
This time, if I want to send you to Hong Kong,

401
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,760
it won't be difficult.

402
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,200
You have no right to send me as you please.

403
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,800
And I hope during the time we are apart.

404
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,040
I will learn

405
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,800
to love you

406
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
more than you love me.

407
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,240
And when that time comes,

408
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,400
I'll be able to sincerely say I love you

409
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,360
and then we can start all over again.

410
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,800
Just getting to marry you

411
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,680
already made me so happy.

412
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,240
The most precious thing in life

413
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,480
is you.

414
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,560
I don't know how much her love for me is,

415
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,760
and where it ends,

416
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,520
but this is more than enough

417
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,680
for me to choose not to let this woman go.

418
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,040
(Two months later)

419
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,080
if I weren't here with you,

420
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,920
would you be okay by yourself?

421
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,520
Can you see now how useful I am?

422
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,080
Hey, Thian.

423
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,880
When you finish eating,

424
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,680
you should throw the food away before you wash the dishes.

425
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,640
Otherwise this leftover will clog the drain.

426
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,320
Thian! Oh, my.

427
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,360
It is all clogged now.

428
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,680
Look, this is bad, you know?

429
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,000
I've told you so many times already.

430
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,960
Why won't you listen?

431
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,320
How many times have I told you

432
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,000
to put your dirty clothes in the basket?

433
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,160
If you keep them scattered like this,

434
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,480
I can't keep collecting them for you.

435
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,280
Thian.

436
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,480
Thian.

437
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,080
Thian!

438
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,239
Sathit.

439
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,799
When did he arrive in Phuket?

440
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,120
He arrived yesterday, Madam.

441
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,000
But he told me not to tell you.

442
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,120
Why don't you wait until next week and tell me?

443
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,600
Actually, I was...

444
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,880
What? Can I do that?

445
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,240
I'm being sarcastic.

446
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,920
You should have told me the day he arrived.

447
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,880
Yes, ma'am.

448
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,240
Oh, what a mess.

449
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,720
Oh, my.

450
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,840
It hit you hard, didn't it?

451
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,120
Moei thought you had gone to Hong Kong.

452
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,200
You know I help you hide this,

453
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,960
not because I think it's right,

454
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,160
But it's for Moei's sake.

455
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,440
I don't want her to worry about you again.

456
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,919
Hey, you can't keep slacking off like this.

457
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,040
Go clean up and eat something.

458
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,560
I'm not hungry.

459
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,080
Let me be honest with you.

460
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,080
I don't know whether the feeling you have towards Moei

461
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,560
is really love.

462
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,760
But if you love her,

463
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,680
you only have to prove to her that you do.

464
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
From now on,

465
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,880
I'll only watch you from afar.

466
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,720
I won't help you with Moei anymore.

467
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,720
When is my birthday?

468
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,000
Which month?

469
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,240
What color do I like?

470
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,200
What's my favorite flower?

471
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,240
What's my

472
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,120
favorite food?

473
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,040
Can you answer even one of them?

474
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,960
You want to have a perfect woman

475
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,440
as your wife.

476
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,360
You're married with me,

477
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,840
but you're still waiting for that person

478
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,920
because I'm not the one you want to marry.

479
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,400
Have you forgotten

480
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,720
why we got married?

481
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,800
I never thought

482
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,040
you knew how to use the water dipper.

483
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,680
Your mouth is full of foam now.

484
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,280
You still look cute.

485
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,400
- Let me. - Whoa!

486
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,600
- Good morning. - Holy Moly!

487
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,760
What do we have for breakfast?

488
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,720
Thian.

489
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,400
Hello, Aunt Pha.

490
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,160
Hello.

491
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,080
Why are you here?

492
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,560
I thought you are gone to Hong Kong.

493
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,959
No.

494
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,039
No?

495
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,640
But Moei told me

496
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,280
you were off to Hong Kong.

497
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,200
I just...

498
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,320
didn't want anyone to know I was here.

499
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,520
I'm here today

500
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,600
to apologize to you.

501
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,120
Apologize to me?

502
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,360
What is this all about?

503
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,080
What are you apologizing to me for?

504
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,320
I'm really sorry...

505
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,760
for not taking care of Moei.

506
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,160
I'm useless, good for nothing.

507
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,520
I didn't know

508
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,880
that Moei nearly died

509
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,200
because of me.

510
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,680
I'm sorry.

511
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,759
It's all right, Thian.

512
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,560
It's all right.

513
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,000
But Moei didn't need to help me.

514
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,000
I was never good enough for her.

515
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,000
My life is not that precious.

516
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,440
Please don't blame yourself.

517
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,120
Everything that happened,

518
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,560
Moei decided to do by herself.

519
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,200
I love you like my own son,

520
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,160
like how I love my daughter.

521
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,400
I could only raise her physically.

522
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,360
But it's her life.

523
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,120
Her heart belongs to her.

524
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,440
She made her own decision.

525
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,240
She chose to protect the person she loved.

526
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,200
Thian.

527
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,960
Let's get up.

528
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,320
Come on.

529
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,480
For everything that happened,

530
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,680
I've never blamed you at all.

531
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,560
If my daughter loves someone,

532
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,640
I'll love that person too.

533
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,920
I know

534
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,200
studying abroad

535
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,360
has always been her dream.

536
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,160
That's why I let her go.

537
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,080
I just wanted to do something for her,

538
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,960
even though it can't compare to what she's done for me.

539
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,160
I want to make her happy

540
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,400
as much as I can.

541
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,280
I want to tell you that I divorced her

542
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,000
not because I don't love her.

543
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,600
You have to tell her that yourself.

544
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,120
My daughter is headstrong.

545
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,120
Once she made up her mind,

546
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,960
it's not easy to change her.

547
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,800
Thian.

548
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,000
If you really love my daughter,

549
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,160
you have to find a way

550
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,080
to get her back.

551
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Thank you.

552
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,160
I...

553
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,840
I'd like to ask you a favor.

554
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,760
I'd like you

555
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,600
to tell me about Moei.

556
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,120
What do you want to know about her?

557
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,960
Well, first of all.

558
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,080
I want to know when she

559
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,520
started to fall for me.

560
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,280
Well, no one knows that,

561
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,760
not even me

562
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,160
or Sajee.

563
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,680
Jee used to always come

564
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,520
and complained about you to us.

565
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,440
Moei always listened to that so heedfully.

566
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,040
At first, she was a little nervous,

567
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,960
but later she would laugh along with everything.

568
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,440
She once told me, even though you were a bully,

569
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,880
you're still adorable.

570
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,560
Every time when you called and she answered,

571
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,480
she would get so excited that she didn't know what to do.

572
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,080
Is this Mrs. Pha's house?

573
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,120
Can I speak to Madam Sajee?

574
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,960
Aunt Jee?

575
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,600
Yes, she's here.

576
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,080
Can you get her on the phone?

577
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,320
Okay.

578
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,480
What was that?

579
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,360
A snake?

580
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,640
Oh, it's a snake. A big snake indeed.

581
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,200
So she was afraid of me?

582
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,040
Yes.

583
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,280
So she was scared of me?

584
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,920
Yes.

585
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,480
Once she knew, she was summoned to meet you.

586
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,880
Moei, Aunt Sajee wants you to meet Thian.

587
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,920
What?

588
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,680
She bumped into things,

589
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,759
and her hands got all clumsy.

590
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,640
It took her a while to collect herself.

591
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,560
Moei!

592
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,200
No wonder why she's so clumsy sometimes.

593
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,640
Only when she's with you.

594
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,280
She wanted to be close to you,

595
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,600
but she didn't have courage.

596
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,920
She was happy

597
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,600
and looked forward to the time she could see you again.

598
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,320
After you had gone to study in Bangkok,

599
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,400
I can still remember

600
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,080
how happy she was

601
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,840
to know she got into the same university as you.

602
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,080
Mom!

603
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,640
Mom, where are you?

604
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,120
What is it, Moei?

605
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,680
Mom, I made it!

606
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,560
I got accepted to the same university as Thian.

607
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,680
I'll get to see his face every day now.

608
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,120
Okay, okay.

609
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,360
He might get annoyed with you.

610
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,480
Well, that, I really don't care.

611
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,440
As long as I get to see his handsome face every day.

612
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,400
What?

613
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,040
Aunt Pha's daughter will be staying with us?

614
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,160
Yes.

615
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,440
Moei is like your little sister.

616
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,600
Both of you should protect and take care of her.

617
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,120
- But... - You're doing the right thing, Mom.

618
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,000
Right?

619
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,400
Right, by the way,

620
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,280
Congrats, you're a freshman now. Well done.

621
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,720
A little closer, dear.

622
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,000
Just come closer, dear. He won't bite.

623
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,240
One, two, three,

624
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,400
smile!

625
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,320
I was such a jerk.

626
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,680
I always picked on her.

627
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,640
When I saw she didn't get mad, I kept doing it.

628
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,840
Thian.

629
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Hmm?

630
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,080
Hey, you wanna mess with me?

631
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,360
Want some?

632
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,880
What's this red thing?

633
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,560
Oh, it's chili powder.

634
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,240
That's why it's good.

635
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,880
Who was that?

636
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,440
(Thiarawat)

637
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,800
Thiarawat, you brat.

638
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,280
Jeez, just get it down already.

639
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,760
Can't you see I'm trying?

640
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,480
Just get to this side and reach for it.

641
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,160
It's not easy, you know?

642
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,480
Oh no!

643
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,280
- Thian! Bees! - What?

644
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,040
- Really? Run! - Thian!

645
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,960
Thian! Wait for me.

646
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,400
Hey, are you all right, Moei?

647
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,520
Whoa!

648
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,720
But she never got mad at you.

649
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,080
When she came home,

650
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,400
she always told me about you and her with joy,

651
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,120
as if in this world of hers

652
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,840
had only you.

653
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,280
Thian.

654
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,239
- Thian. - Thian, she's calling you.

655
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,800
I don't think she's calling me.

656
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,200
Wait, Thian.

657
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,080
I know you have to work on your project later until late,

658
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,040
so I bought you some food and water.

659
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,400
I'm not going to eat that.

660
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,200
- There he goes again. - But...

661
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,280
Thian.

662
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,839
What is it now?

663
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,680
Aunt Jee told me to go home with you.

664
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,680
- I'm not going home. - Wait, Thian.

665
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,200
Where are you going then?

666
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,520
It's none of your business.

667
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,080
Listen, stop following me around or waiting for me.

668
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,280
You know, everyone is saying that we're dating.

669
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,400
- Really? - Why are you smiling?

670
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,240
Nothing.

671
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,320
Look, Moei.

672
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,440
I don't want people to misunderstand

673
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,960
that I'm dating a nerd like you.

674
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,720
So from now on,

675
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,200
stop following me around. Don't wait for me.

676
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,320
Just go your own way.

677
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,600
Got it?

678
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,280
Hey.

679
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,920
Well, this is my way home, too.

680
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,960
Just keep some distance, then.

681
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,520
- Oh. - Oh.

682
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,040
Well, I came to buy some things.

683
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,680
Please keep raining,

684
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,440
so I can stay a little longer with him.

685
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,520
Aunt Pha,

686
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,680
I am aware

687
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,720
we can't change the past.

688
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,480
But I believe

689
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,680
that if we know what we have done wrong

690
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,840
and never repeat them,

691
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,280
everything will get better.

692
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,999
We'd like to officially welcome TecTien, our best friend,

693
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,720
back to our department

694
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,640
once again.

695
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,479
So please, Thian.

696
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,400
Let us crown you.

697
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,079
No, man.

698
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,640
- Let's put these on. - All right, guys.

699
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,640
That's enough for the welcoming.

700
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,400
Hey, I can't believe it.

701
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,920
You had the opportunity

702
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,320
- to work in Hong Kong, - Right.

703
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,240
but you ditched it and went to Phuket instead.

704
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,360
Are you out of your mind? I don't get you.

705
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,559
You've been friends with him for ages, you still don't get him?

706
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,760
- It's called the heart-healing period. - I see.

707
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,720
Thian.

708
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,400
I've assigned a new assistant for you.

709
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,640
Come in.

710
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,360
Hello, Thian.

711
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,360
I've heard so much about you.

712
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,000
I finally get to meet you.

713
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,400
This is Aoey. She's your junior from college.

714
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,520
She's good, dynamic, and tough.

715
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,080
Just right to work with you.

716
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,040
Please accept me in your care.

717
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,839
Hang on. Right now, I still don't know the workload.

718
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,920
Maybe I won't need an assistant.

719
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,719
Besides, I'm not supervising Hammoc anymore.

720
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,360
I think she can get back to her work.

721
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,560
Don't waste her time here.

722
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,680
Is that how you want?

723
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,000
It's better.

724
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,320
If I need an assistant, I'll summon you.

725
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,319
Well then, whatever you say.

726
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,999
Excuse me. Please don't think too much about this.

727
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,679
My friend just still can't get over his former assistant.

728
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,520
No one can replace this position.

729
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,800
- Come here, you foul-mouthed brat. - What's with you?

730
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,519
- Just shut it. - Stop talking.

731
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,080
Hey, Thian. Don't be sad, all right?

732
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,360
How about this? Since it's been quite a while

733
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,720
for us four buddies to hang out together, I say

734
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,360
- after work this evening... - Hey.

735
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,920
Are you sure about that?

736
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,080
I don't think his condition is ready.

737
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,360
- Where to? - There you go.

738
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,479
Nice! See?

739
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,719
Going clubbing, of course.

740
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,640
Since it's the last Friday of the month, we should go clubbing.

741
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,720
I'm not going.

742
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,680
- I can't believe this. - Thian, wait, man.

743
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,879
How long are you going to be like this?

744
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,240
We want the old you back.

745
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,480
Yes, Chet.

746
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,000
All right.

747
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,480
Supervise a site in Nakhon Pathom?

748
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,999
Well, so can you go...

749
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,600
- Sure. - What?

750
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,240
If it was before,

751
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,320
you'd send someone else to a small site like this.

752
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,440
Unlike Moei,

753
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,560
whatever work she's assigned to,

754
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,920
she never said no.

755
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,960
Well, I forgot to tell you.

756
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,959
For Nakhon Pathom's site,

757
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,000
it would be inconvenient to drive there

758
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,920
due to road construction.

759
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
It's all right.

760
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,400
- I'm not planning to drive there. - What?

761
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,360
So, how are you...

762
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,640
Hey.

763
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,440
(Om Noi - Mahachai)

764
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,560
Can you see now, Thian?

765
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,880
I told you taking a bus is quite comfy.

766
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,200
With 20 windows and cool breeze.

767
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,560
Do you believe me now?

768
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,600
I do now.

769
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,640
What are you saying, young man?

770
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,040
It's nothing.

771
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,080
Have a nice day.

772
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,680
(Nakhon Pathom - Mahachai)

773
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,960
Moei!

774
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,399
Here you are.

775
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,200
Look, I got you some papayas.

776
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,719
You can have them every day.

777
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,840
I assure you, you'll poop easily.

778
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,560
I have lots of them.

779
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,120
- Thank you. - Oh, wait.

780
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,280
What's that?

781
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,000
This?

782
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,600
Would you like some?

783
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,280
Can I? I'll take them all.

784
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,120
Let's exchange.

785
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,040
- I'll go now. - Okay.

786
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,120
Now I have Thai basil and chili.

787
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,960
I'll make stir-fried pork with Thai basil and share with you.

788
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,000
Here, your knife.

789
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,040
I already have lots at home.

790
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,120
This is so worth it.

791
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,079
It's very breezy, isn't it?

792
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,040
You'll totally be living in the nature.

793
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,800
You can see the boats passing by.

794
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,080
It's very beautiful.

795
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,959
It's very cool and pleasant.

796
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,360
I'm telling you, everyone likes it here.

797
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,880
What do you think, Mom?

798
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,399
I like it.

799
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,520
It's nice and pleasant.

800
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,360
I think it suits you.

801
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,840
You're totally right.

802
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,000
Okay, I'll rent this house.

803
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,520
But I'd like to move in tomorrow.

804
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,880
Are you in a hurry?

805
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,480
Yes, I am.

806
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,280
Studying abroad

807
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,320
has always been her dream.

808
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,080
That's why I let her go.

809
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,200
I just wanted to do something for her.

810
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,559
I must be seeing things.

811
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,960
Why would she be here?

812
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,760
Is Prapha not home?

813
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,960
Hello, Prapha. Where are you?

814
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,560
I... I'm home.

815
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,000
You're home?

816
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,960
Well, yes.

817
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,120
You got it, ma'am.

818
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,480
What is it, Jee?

819
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,320
Oh, it's nothing.

820
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,320
It's been quite some time, I thought we could get lunch.

821
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,120
I see. But I'm not free right now.

822
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,960
I have desserts to deliver.

823
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,840
All right, next time then.

824
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,240
Mom.

825
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,720
Whose voice is that?

826
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,920
Oh, it's the television.

827
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,800
I have to go now, Jee.

828
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,400
I have to finish baking or I'll be late.

829
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,520
All right.

830
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,960
Was that Aunt Jee?

831
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,640
Do you think she heard me?

832
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,680
- Madam. - So?

833
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,040
I peeked into the house, there's really no one.

834
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,760
That's what I thought.

835
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,200
But over the phone just now,

836
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,160
I think I heard Moei's voice.

837
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,479
Come on, Madam. That can't be possible.

838
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,240
Isn't she abroad right now?

839
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,319
Exactly.

840
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,760
She is abroad right now. So how can she be here?

841
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,879
Prapha and Moei must be hiding something.

842
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,480
That's why she lied to me about being home.

843
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,679
Copy that, Madam.

844
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,800
I'll look into this and find out

845
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,240
what's going on.

846
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,559
You seem to read my mind these days.

847
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,600
- Yes, ma'am. - Good.

848
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,120
- Just be quick. - Yes, sir.

849
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,520
Why did she lie?

850
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,240
Mom, are you thinking about Aunt Jee?

851
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,200
Yes, it worries me she might get suspicious.

852
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,400
You know how smart she is.

853
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,200
That's true.

854
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,520
Well then, tomorrow, I'll go back to Phuket.

855
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,520
I'll come visit you later.

856
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,480
I'll have to visit her once I get back.

857
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,800
Otherwise, she'll look for me at home.

858
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,920
That's a good idea, Mom.

859
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,640
Then, you should go back to Phuket.

860
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,320
Actually, you don't have to visit me often.

861
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,720
I'm all right. You don't have to worry.

862
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,360
I'll buy the ticket for you.

863
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,560
Thank you.

864
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,480
Let's go, Mom.

865
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,520
Mom.

866
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,359
Once you get to the airport,

867
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,960
please call me.

868
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,520
I will.

869
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,039
You, too.

870
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,760
Go straight home and don't stroll around.

871
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,800
Okay.

872
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,440
I'm going now.

873
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,560
- Bye. - Bye.

874
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,920
Is everyone here?

875
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,840
- All right. - Good luck.

876
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,560
Thank you.

877
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,320
Moei.

878
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,520
Moei!

879
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,160
Hey, don't cut in line.

880
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,880
I'm sorry.

881
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:04,960
Moei.

882
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,400
Moei!

883
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,480
Excuse me. Sorry.

884
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,080
Excuse me.

885
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,760
I'm sorry.

886
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,200
I'm sorry.

887
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,080
Damn.

888
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,320
Moei!

889
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,560
Moei.

890
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,079
Excuse me! Please stop the bus!

891
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,559
Can you tell the driver to stop?

892
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,680
Stop the bus.

893
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,160
Excuse me.

894
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,240
Moei!

895
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:07,960
Moei!

896
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,040
Moei.

897
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,200
I'm sorry.

898
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,560
(Would you like to block T.Navanawakul?)

899
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,040
(T.Navanawakul is blocked.)

900
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,760
Keep up, Moei.

901
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,880
You can do it.

902
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,560
I saw Moei in Nakhon Pathom.

903
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,000
You saw Moei in Nakhon Pathom?

904
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,480
Are you missing her too much?

905
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,520
How would she be in Nakhon Pathom?

906
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,720
That's what I thought.

907
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,200
But it's obviously her today.

908
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,040
It must be her.

909
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:17,119
Hey, I think you must have been seeing things.

910
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,559
I don't believe you saw her.

911
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,200
- Impossible. - I wasn't seeing things.

912
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,640
Why don't you check her Instagram?

913
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,960
- IG, you say? - Yes.

914
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,080
That's impossible. She blocked me ages ago.

915
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,039
IG, Facebook, Line, all blocked.

916
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,040
Okay.

917
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,080
Then we can't help you anymore.

918
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,280
Since she blocked the three of us too.

919
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,320
What?

920
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,560
- She blocked you too? - Yes.

921
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,520
Why would she do that?

922
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,960
You should get over her, man.

923
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,720
It's so clear now

924
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,080
that she doesn't want you to know her whereabouts.

925
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,960
I think

926
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,200
not only doesn't she want him to know her whereabouts,

927
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,400
she wants to remove him from her life.

928
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,120
I have to find out.

929
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:11,240
(Nakhon Pathom - Samut Sakhon)

930
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,840
I want to tell you

931
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,520
that I divorced her

932
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,120
not because I don't love her.

933
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,600
You have to tell her that yourself.

934
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,320
My daughter is headstrong.

935
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,200
Once she made up her mind,

936
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,960
it's not easy to change her.

937
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,040
If you really love my daughter,

938
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,240
you have to find a way

939
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,040
to get her back.

940
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,760
Baan Suan Romruen, please.

941
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Thank you.

942
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,800
I'd like to follow that boat.

943
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,199
Okay. Twenty baht, please.

944
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,320
Twenty baht.

945
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,960
- Let's go. - Go.

946
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,400
(Baan Suan Romruen)

947
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,240
(Baan Suan Romruen)

948
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,760
Who are you here for?

949
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,600
Oh my goodness, he's so hot.

950
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,320
Mr. Hottie

951
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,520
who are you here for?

952
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,240
- Is Moei here? - How are you related to her?

953
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,680
Are you her brother?

954
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,680
No, I'm her husband.

955
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,640
Oh, my.

956
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:48,079
Holy moly, where did she find such a hot husband? Oh, my gosh.

957
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:51,200
What did she do to get a hubby this gorgeous?

958
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,440
- If I were her... - Excuse me.

959
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,760
So, is Moei here?

960
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,120
Wait. Hold on.

961
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,440
Are you really her husband?

962
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,280
Why don't you know she's here?

963
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,640
We had a fight

964
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,760
and she ran away.

965
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,760
I don't buy it. You are this hot, I'm sure you have lots of girls.

966
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,800
- Am I right? - No. That's not it.

967
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,600
We fought over something else.

968
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,880
Then please wait here.

969
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,840
I'll let her know you're here.

970
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:15,960
No, wait.

971
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,360
- Why? - You can't tell her.

972
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,160
If you tell her, she'll run again.

973
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,240
Hello?

974
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,880
Yes. Well,

975
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,840
please give me a few more days.

976
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,560
And I'll send you the first draft.

977
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,480
All right, yes. Bye.

978
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,160
Moei!

979
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,160
Moei!

980
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,760
Moei!

981
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,520
Moei!

982
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,680
Moei!

983
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,240
Moei. Moei.

984
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,160
Moei.

985
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,600
Sajee.

986
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,840
It's okay. I'll help.

987
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,320
Why?

988
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,800
Why are you so surprised to see me?

989
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,000
Hmm?

990
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,440
I didn't expect you would come here.

991
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,799
You have lots of customers these days.

992
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,280
You made desserts yesterday, today you do again.

993
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,520
Right. Yes.

994
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,640
Prapha, stop lying to me.

995
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,240
I know Moei is in Nakhon Pathom.

996
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,400
Oh, my.

997
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,280
I'll clean this up. Please be surprised all you want.

998
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,240
- Madam Sajee. - Yes.

999
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,040
I looked into it and found out

1000
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,600
that Moei didn't go abroad like she said.

1001
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,720
Besides, after that day,

1002
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:00,400
there was no record of her traveling anywhere.

1003
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:04,240
Are you saying she's been in Thailand for the past two months?

1004
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,520
That's right.

1005
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,360
Jeez, Moei is really...

1006
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,080
so good at covering her track.

1007
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,880
There is no record of her

1008
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,080
using her credit card either.

1009
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,720
The most interesting part is this.

1010
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,920
I have been told

1011
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,239
there were people similar to Moei

1012
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,959
and Mrs. Prapha started renting this place two months ago.

1013
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,440
This matches the time when she said

1014
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,480
she would go abroad to study.

1015
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,240
So?

1016
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,840
Did I get everything right?

1017
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,920
So, what's wrong with my wife?

1018
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,880
Oh, please don't worry.

1019
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,680
It's normal for a pregnant woman to bleed

1020
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,200
during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

1021
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,200
However, it only occurs for a short while.

1022
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,040
It will be gone in a few days.

1023
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,920
- My wife is pregnant? - That's right.

1024
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,120
What?

1025
01:31:22,121 --> 01:31:23,480
Moei is with Thian's child?

1026
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,280
I'm sorry

1027
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,760
that I didn't tell you earlier.

1028
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,159
Moei doesn't want to be a burden to anyone,

1029
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,999
so we have decided to take care of each other.

1030
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,119
Goodness, Prapha. You're really...

1031
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,679
How could you see me as a stranger?

1032
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:44,359
You should have told me about something this important.

1033
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,680
You made me feel slighted, Prapha.

1034
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,400
You two have never been a burden to me.

1035
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,920
You both are like members of my family.

1036
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,440
I love Moei like my own daughter.

1037
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,680
And I love you like my own sister.

1038
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,479
I'm really sorry.

1039
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,800
You're really...

1040
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,360
Don't you feel worried

1041
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,040
letting your daughter live alone and away from you?

1042
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,920
I didn't agree at first.

1043
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,400
But she's so headstrong that I had to let her.

1044
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,760
You know how she is.

1045
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,000
Once she decides to do something,

1046
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,760
she won't change her mind easily.

1047
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:21,840
I didn't want her to stress about it.

1048
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,320
But I've been visiting her

1049
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,600
- and the neighbor... - That's enough.

1050
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,320
Now that I know everything,

1051
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,800
you can't turn down my help.

1052
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,120
Don't say anything.

1053
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,360
I'll talk to Moei myself.

1054
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,560
- Sathit. - Yes, ma'am.

1055
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,960
- Let's go. - Yes, ma'am.

1056
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,760
You come too.

1057
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,160
Hello, Thian.

1058
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:52,960
What?

1059
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,160
- Moei passed out? - What?

1060
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,440
Excuse me.

1061
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:45,240
Please come to arrange the room for Ms. Natheerin.

1062
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,320
All right.

1063
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,279
The doctor would like to have you observed a little longer.

1064
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,720
If there is no complication, then you can go home.

1065
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,400
Thank you. But wait...

1066
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,720
Yes?

1067
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:36,360
So, who brought me here?

1068
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,320
It was your husband.

1069
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,600
What?

1070
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,160
My husband?

1071
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,440
Yes.

1072
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:44,880
Excuse me.

1073
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,720
Your husband is here.

1074
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,840
Thian.

1075
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,200
What are you doing here?

1076
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,800
Moei. Wait, no.

1077
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,319
Where are you going? The doctor said you needed to stay longer.

1078
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,320
Moei.

1079
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,360
Fine.

1080
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,800
I'll stay.

1081
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,320
But you have to go.

1082
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,520
Weren't you the one who made the promise

1083
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,400
that we would stay apart?

1084
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,520
Why break your own words?

1085
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,040
Well, you're not well.

1086
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,120
How can you be by yourself?

1087
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,440
All these times,

1088
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,840
I always listened and did what you said.

1089
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,800
No matter where you told me to stay

1090
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,680
or what to do,

1091
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,040
I always did it.

1092
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,760
I was everything for you.

1093
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,320
When you wanted something,

1094
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,640
no matter how hard it was to find,

1095
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,760
I'd find it for you.

1096
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,080
Today,

1097
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,320
I'm asking you to leave me alone,

1098
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,600
won't you do that for me?

1099
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,600
It can't be hard for you.

1100
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,880
Moei,

1101
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,360
but we're having a child together.

1102
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,800
This is important. Why didn't you tell me?

1103
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,280
From now on,

1104
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,760
we can't stay apart.

1105
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,080
I won't allow that.

1106
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:54,600
Why?

1107
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,000
What if you didn't find me today?

1108
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,640
What if I went abroad, and I wasn't expecting a child?

1109
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,360
Would everything still be like this?

1110
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,560
When I told you I wanted to study abroad,

1111
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,400
I just wanted the two years that we are apart

1112
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,320
to be the time for you to think

1113
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,640
whether you still wanted me.

1114
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,120
But wasn't it you

1115
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,920
who ran away without telling me anything?

1116
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,680
Wasn't it you who came up with this silly condition

1117
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,080
that we wouldn't contact each other?

1118
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:43,720
And now,

1119
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,000
you suddenly came back to me,

1120
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,040
saying you want to take care of me.

1121
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,760
You know, I'm totally confused now.

1122
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,520
I...

1123
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,320
I'm sorry, Moei.

1124
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,160
I want us not to contact each other.

1125
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,600
I want both of us

1126
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,720
to do as we promised.

1127
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,200
So you and me

1128
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,840
can find out

1129
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,040
and know for certain

1130
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,160
if we had to stay apart,

1131
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,600
would we still love each other.

1132
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,880
How does that sound?

1133
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,720
If you can't do this for me,

1134
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,360
this will be the last time you see me.

1135
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,840
Do you want that?

1136
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,719
If everything goes as planned,

1137
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,360
Moei is all yours.

1138
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,760
Why don't you prove you can do the same for her?

1139
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,880
I've chosen this home to raise you in.

1140
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,600
As it feels warm

1141
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:13,640
like the home in my memory.

1142
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,920
The home where I was once happy.
