1
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,520
Why is this so hard for you to understand?

2
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,240
Or I need to act like a married couple like you did earlier. Huh?

3
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,480
He's going to be our new team leader.

4
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,760
I am Thiarawat.

5
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,680
He isn't sent here to support us.

6
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,280
He's sent here to keep an eye on us.

7
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,319
Didn't Thian tell you he's married?

8
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,400
What?

9
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,080
My father is one of TPC's shareholders now.

10
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,279
- Whoa. - Oh my.

11
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
When did I disobey you?

12
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,480
Take it off.

13
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,040
Why don't you take it off when I say so?

14
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,280
- A lubricant. - Eew, it's gross!

15
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,480
- Moei. - Hey.

16
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,200
What? Sorry, what is it?

17
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,679
I went upstairs to deliver the document.

18
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,879
You can't do the easy task.

19
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,360
How can you handle a bigger one?

20
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,200
I don't want to tell people we're married.

21
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,600
It's for your own sake.

22
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm doing this for you.

23
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,560
It's just an excuse.

24
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,320
- Moei. - You never loved me at all.

25
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,120
From now on, Natheerin will be my assistant.

26
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
What?

27
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,160
I appointing you as my assistant

28
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
is actually my plan to keep Yada out.

29
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,640
If we make her believe that we're really close,

30
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,680
she may stop trying to approach me.

31
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,280
Understood?

32
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,600
Understood.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
And remember.

34
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,920
Don't interfere with my private life.

35
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,120
Do you hear what I'm saying?

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
Loud and clear.

37
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,600
Good.

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,880
And from this moment on,

39
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,560
you have to do everything I tell you to.

40
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,600
You already said that.

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,519
Why? I'm saying it again, got a problem?

42
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,960
No, of course not.

43
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,080
Who would dare go against the beastly Thian?

44
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,360
You agreed not to force me to resign.

45
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm really thankful for that.

46
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,440
- Stop your sarcastic act. - Ouch!

47
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,079
I wasn't being sarcastic.

48
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,760
I really appreciate your kindness.

49
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,119
From now on, I'll do everything you want me to.

50
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
I'll act as your assistant

51
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,640
as well as your wife.

52
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,240
I'll really do my best.

53
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm not your playmate.

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,520
You want to take over TPC.

55
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,040
And you want my help?

56
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm curious what changed your mind.

57
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,640
Since you've been hiding it from me all the time.

58
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
I've been thinking.

59
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,480
Having all their projects in our hands

60
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,840
is far better than a few dividends from a few shares.

61
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Pondej.

62
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,080
You know quite a few high-ups.

63
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
If we join force,

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,200
we can share an immense benefit equally.

65
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,440
Well, I don't know.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,760
It's a great deal you're talking about.

67
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,400
I'm not sure how much I can help.

68
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,120
I just don't want to give a promise

69
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,440
and then fail like last time.

70
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,080
How about you listen to what I have to offer?

71
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,639
TPC holds billions of authorized share capital.

72
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,960
It also attracts a lot of international investors.

73
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,000
Once we get hold of the company,

74
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
we sell all the shares.

75
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,280
How much money will come in our pocket?

76
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,760
It's lots of figures, right?

77
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,320
Ouch!

78
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
Oh my. I'm sorry.

79
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,320
- Let me help. - Kob.

80
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,160
It's all right.

81
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,280
Just let me help.

82
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,160
We won't see very often now.

83
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,840
So you know.

84
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,040
Chad told me you had to work with Thian.

85
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,880
Thank you very much.

86
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,200
Don't worry. Carrying a box is a piece of cake.

87
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,040
I mean, not only for this.

88
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,360
I want to thank you

89
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,280
for everything.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
I sincerely thank you.

91
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,280
Moei.

92
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,880
Yes?

93
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,920
I'd like to ask you something.

94
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,240
Are you really married?

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,720
I want to hear it from you.

96
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,680
Yes.

97
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm...

98
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,800
I'm really sorry.

99
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,280
Why would you say sorry? You did nothing wrong.

100
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,520
It's me who has a crush on you.

101
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,160
So,

102
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,760
I'll try to get over the fact that you're married.

103
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,999
If you don't feel comfortable

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
to see me or talk to me,

105
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,960
you can avoid me.

106
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,480
I totally get it.

107
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,640
Just don't avoid me forever.

108
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,520
Ms. Yada.

109
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Hello.

110
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,399
Are you here to meet Mr. Thada?

111
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,320
Who else should I meet if not my father?

112
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,040
You can't see him now.

113
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,520
He is meeting with a guest.

114
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,800
Who is it?

115
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,880
How about this, Father?

116
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,800
I'll leave this wine with you.

117
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,400
Once our plan succeeds,

118
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,840
we'll celebrate together.

119
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,639
How's that?

120
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,760
All right.

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,560
Hopefully, it'll be soon.

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,080
Certainly.

123
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
Well, I should get going.

124
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
Have a nice day.

125
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,760
See you at home, Okay?

126
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,240
Dad.

127
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's talk inside.

128
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,840
I won't go back to him.

129
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,560
You have to.

130
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,080
He doesn't agree to divorce.

131
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,200
And a wife should be with her husband.

132
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,920
How much did he pay you

133
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,960
to send me back to be his slave?

134
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
That's none of your business.

135
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,200
Your only task is going back to Pondej

136
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,200
and doing your best as his wife.

137
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,719
Didn't you say you wanted Thada Construction

138
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,999
be able to stand on its feet

139
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,839
so we wouldn't have to be afraid of him?

140
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes but as long as he's a benefit to us,

141
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,400
you have to keep a status as his wife.

142
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
You're so selfish.

143
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,040
You only think of yourself.

144
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,480
You never asked how I felt about it.

145
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,840
You never cared whether or not I was happy.

146
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,320
You never asked me that.

147
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,560
I care for you. That's why I'm doing all this.

148
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,160
Is this how you care for me?

149
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,600
You can't imagine

150
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,280
what I've been through all this time.

151
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,400
Listen.

152
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,600
Go home and pack your things.

153
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,480
And go back to your husband.

154
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,120
Don't you ever think

155
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,280
I'd be pleased if you took that skillful

156
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,120
but cheap architect in the family.

157
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,000
A guy like that,

158
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,640
even though he works his butt off,

159
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,080
he can never gain as much benefit as Pondej.

160
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,280
Remember that.

161
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,760
I hate you.

162
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,120
Thian.

163
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
What's going on?

164
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
It's just covered with vines.

165
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,520
Why made such a big fuss?

166
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,640
I'll wait here then.

167
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,520
Where did they come from?

168
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,400
Why can't it come out?

169
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,880
You know what?

170
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,680
When you are really focusing on something,

171
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,560
you are so cute.

172
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,640
Gosh!

173
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,840
Why are you smiling?

174
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,160
Can you unwind it?

175
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,680
- Should I help? - No.

176
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,160
One should bike on the road.

177
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,560
Not in the woods.

178
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,480
Why are you laughing?

179
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,680
You think it's funny? Come here.

180
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
- Come here. - No! Thian.

181
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,200
Stop it right now. You're getting me messy.

182
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,440
I surely won't be a total mess alone.

183
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,919
Are you running off?

184
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,079
Come back here.

185
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,440
Come here.

186
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,760
- I gotcha. - No.

187
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,840
Have you brought your mind to work?

188
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,520
Yes?

189
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,480
Come have a look.

190
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,960
Watch it closely.

191
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,280
- Okay. - I'll show you just once.

192
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,640
All right.

193
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,520
This is insane.

194
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,640
It's a graphic work.

195
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,480
But he only uses keyboard to input the commands.

196
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,760
Wow.

197
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,400
He's a wizard.

198
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,120
Is he the same guy watching porn video last night?

199
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
Sorry.

200
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,080
Thank you, Thian.

201
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
What for?

202
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,280
For what you showed me just now.

203
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,800
Thian.

204
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,720
You aren't mad at me anymore, right?

205
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,840
- About what? - It's...

206
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,600
about me telling everyone.

207
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm already married.

208
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,200
It's okay since you didn't say whom you got married with.

209
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,720
Here.

210
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,480
And go back to work.

211
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,440
Thank you.

212
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,920
Just go.

213
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,599
(@WORK invited you to join group)

214
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
(Okay)

215
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,520
(Moei has joined the group.)

216
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,160
(Beer: Welcome)

217
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,960
(Nott: Welcome / Toon: Welcome)

218
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,520
(Moei: Thank you.)

219
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,759
Hey, Thian.

220
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,280
Why don't you join the group?

221
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,400
Oh, this guy...

222
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,960
Are you playing hard to get?

223
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,439
Or you want me to beg?

224
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,279
Why are you create another chat group?

225
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
It's too much headache.

226
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Hey.

227
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,640
Are you saying you won't join the group?

228
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
That's right.

229
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,240
Hey! Give my phone back.

230
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,920
- Beer, take it. - Give it back.

231
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,360
Beer, give it back.

232
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,840
I said give it back.

233
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,160
- Beer. - It's done.

234
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,359
I got you joined in the group.

235
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,920
If you leave, we'll curse you.

236
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,639
And Yada shall be chasing you forever.

237
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,840
I'm asking you nicely.

238
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm happy now.

239
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,480
Oh my back. It's so stiff.

240
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,280
How about we go for a nice chilled drink?

241
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,520
- Nice. - That's a great idea.

242
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,600
Hey.

243
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,720
Didn't you say you would take your work home?

244
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,600
Come on. We have a whole Sunday to finish it.

245
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,760
Exactly. You're right.

246
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,040
When going for a night out, you take it so quickly.

247
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,279
No second thought at all.

248
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,920
I can't join you tonight.

249
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,719
I have to take Moei home.

250
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,760
Moei?

251
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,240
Moei? Where's she?

252
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,200
Hey, why are you walking so far away?

253
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,199
Just bring her along. She's a big girl now.

254
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,840
Have a quick meal and take her home.

255
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,600
You don't want that? Are you...

256
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,520
being protective?

257
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,600
Protective, your ass.

258
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,840
I'm not being protective.

259
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,040
Not protective, but you won't let her come.

260
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
Moei, would you like to join us?

261
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,039
Just a few drinks before going home.

262
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,400
Not later than 10.30 pm.

263
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,040
Can I go?

264
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,440
"Can I go?"

265
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,400
- All right. - Yay!

266
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,240
He said yes. Let's go.

267
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,160
We're like a family at TPC.

268
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,160
- Clap. Clap. - TPC.

269
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,960
You can't get too drunk, all right?

270
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,400
- Let's go have a drink. - Yay!

271
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,440
- Let's go! - TPC...

272
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,240
I told you not to let her drink.

273
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,800
Now look at her.

274
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,679
Way too tipsy after a few drinks.

275
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,000
Now she's dancing over there.

276
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,800
Doesn't she know she's a lightweight?

277
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,160
Hey, old man.

278
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,680
Can you stop all the fuss?

279
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,200
You're nagging too much. I find her super cute.

280
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,319
Oh.

281
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,240
Come on, Uncle Thian. Get up.

282
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,720
Suit yourself.

283
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,680
We're going down the stairs now.

284
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,240
Moei.

285
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,280
Moei.

286
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,600
Moei.

287
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,800
Gosh!

288
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,600
Just a second.

289
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,359
Come on. Get up.

290
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,960
How could you get so pissed?

291
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,560
I said just a second.

292
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,520
I can fly. I am flying.

293
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,200
Come on.

294
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,680
Get in.

295
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,840
Can you stop moving?

296
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,880
Thian.

297
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,640
I am worried about you

298
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,880
so much.

299
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,640
Moei.

300
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,880
Moei.

301
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,040
It's good that you doze off.

302
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,560
- Moei. - Hmm?

303
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,760
We're home now.

304
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,240
It's stuck.

305
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,280
You smell so nice.

306
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,080
Ouch!

307
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,440
Thian.

308
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,400
Thian.

309
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,520
- Does it hurt? - Of course, it does.

310
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,320
It's okay now. All right?

311
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey.

312
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,480
- What are you doing? - Hmm?

313
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,400
Nothing.

314
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,920
I'll get in now.

315
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,640
Hey.

316
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,800
It's this way.

317
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,720
It's your room now.

318
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Where are you going?

319
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,600
Going to bed, of course.

320
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,400
Your room is over there.

321
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,840
No. I want to sleep in your room.

322
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,320
Thian.

323
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,400
Can you hear me?

324
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,960
Come on. Go to your room.

325
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,120
My room is here.

326
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
- It's not your room. Come. - Thian.

327
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,960
- Come on. - No.

328
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Let go of your hand.

329
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,760
I want to sleep in your room.

330
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,680
Moei. Your room is locked.

331
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,840
Sleep here tonight.

332
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Gosh!

333
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,000
Why? Huh?

334
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,279
Why?

335
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,360
Why what?

336
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,600
We're married.

337
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,840
Don't you know how to give?

338
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,400
I even sacrificed myself for you.

339
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,160
Aren't you going to repay me at all?

340
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,200
I really wonder

341
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,400
which law will I have to break

342
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,720
if I force my husband to sleep with me.

343
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,840
Moei.

344
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,919
What are you doing?

345
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm going to rape you.

346
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,480
How...

347
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,600
did I end up in this room?

348
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,240
Last night...

349
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,360
Last night...

350
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,320
Oh, no.

351
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,280
No. It can't be.

352
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,760
It can't be.

353
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,320
Thian.

354
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,160
Did it really happen?

355
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,560
Hey.

356
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,160
If you're having some naughty thoughts, stop it.

357
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,920
Oh.

358
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,800
Why didn't you

359
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,400
put me in my room?

360
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,600
Where's the key?

361
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,720
The key?

362
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,720
Where's my key?

363
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Exactly.

364
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,920
Where's the key?

365
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,040
Can we talk about the key later?

366
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,200
Why did you get me all tied up?

367
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,240
How should I begin?

368
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,560
Get off of me, Moei.

369
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,240
Moei.

370
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,680
What's the heck with you?

371
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,800
Where are you?

372
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,800
Thian.

373
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,080
How about we

374
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,520
have a few rounds of fun?

375
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,360
Moei.

376
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,439
Moei.

377
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,000
Get off of me.

378
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,120
Gosh! Get off of me.

379
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,999
You were overly turned-on.

380
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,840
Did you watch my porn videos?

381
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,480
I can only die

382
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,440
to escape from this embarrassment.

383
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,839
- What should I do now? - What is it?

384
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,040
I shouldn't have watched Fifty Shades of Grey.

385
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,560
Luckily, I didn't pull those chain-and-cuff gags.

386
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,239
Otherwise I would really have to kill myself.

387
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,680
I don't like the movie neither.

388
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
It's too much censored.

389
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,240
You're funny.

390
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,280
They say the drunk always tell the truth.

391
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Do you think so? Now that it's you.

392
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,680
And I don't know if Thian believes this theory.

393
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,400
Besides,

394
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,800
Thian is not a stupid guy.

395
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,400
I guess he must know that you have fallen for him.

396
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,280
Where's my phone?

397
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,360
Where is it?

398
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,719
Don't you think it's time to tell him

399
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,160
that you love him?

400
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,039
- Confess my love for him? - Yes.

401
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,600
- No way. - Why not?

402
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,040
What if he hates me after that?

403
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,040
He doesn't even want to look at me now.

404
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,280
I'm happy just loving him, doing things for him,

405
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,320
and being by his side.

406
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,159
How sweet but pitiful.

407
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,119
- What? - You can live with that forever?

408
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,680
Of course, I can.

409
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,920
- Yeah? - Let's say if we divorce,

410
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,640
I'm still like his sister.

411
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,520
But if he hates me, I can't be even his sister.

412
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,960
Today's my most exciting day ever.

413
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,919
I know that the senior class president,

414
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,720
the guy who's my love at first sight is my Thian.

415
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,600
And he's also my peer mentor.

416
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,279
What is this called?

417
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,760
A destiny?

418
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,880
Thian is sick today.

419
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,400
He's absent from school.

420
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,440
I'm so worried about him.

421
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,840
Should I skip the class and go to the hospital?

422
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,640
Today is his last day at school.

423
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,680
I won't get to see him anymore.

424
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,360
It's like my world has a missing piece.

425
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,400
What should I do now?

426
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,200
I can't get over him.

427
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,480
I must have completely

428
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,000
fallen for him.

429
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,080
I like it when you're obedient.

430
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,960
Hey.

431
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,680
What's with you?

432
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,280
Are you having a naughty thought?

433
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,880
Of course not.

434
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,759
What is your type of guy?

435
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,320
I like a clever guy.

436
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,439
- A very talented guy. - Why?

437
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,840
Maybe because I am not a clever one.

438
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
What are you doing?

439
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,000
Moei.

440
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,920
- Moei. - Hey.

441
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,760
What? Sorry, what is it?

442
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,280
What is it that you fear more?

443
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,080
Having that woman chasing you

444
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,640
or people knowing that we're married?

445
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,280
I said no, and that's the end of it.

446
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,800
You're selfish.

447
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,680
You never care how I feel.

448
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,640
I don't want to tell people you're married.

449
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,280
It's for your own sake.

450
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,840
I'm doing it for you.

451
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,840
All you have are excuses.

452
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,600
- Moei. - You never loved me at all.

453
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,240
- Beer. - Hmm?

454
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,160
If a woman didn't love a man,

455
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,080
would she marry him just to help him?

456
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,200
Come on.

457
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,040
Are you out of your mind?

458
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,920
No matter how decent the man was,

459
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,800
no women would do such stupid thing.

460
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,000
What does it mean if she married him?

461
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,920
It means that woman loves the man.

462
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,840
Wait. Hang on.

463
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,760
Oh, man.

464
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,840
Are you saying Moei has a crush on you?

465
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,440
Whoa, whoa, is that true?

466
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,240
Is it?

467
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
I don't know.

468
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,560
But I don't have feelings for her.

469
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,800
What if

470
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
she really has a crush on you?

471
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,640
Yeah.

472
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,040
What would it be now, I wonder

473
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,080
if that night

474
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,520
he cooperated with me?

475
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,920
No. Stop it.

476
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,960
Stop that thought right now.

477
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,879
But we nearly got to that point

478
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,480
in the dream.

479
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,199
It's a mosquito.

480
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,360
A mosquito?

481
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,960
Holy moly.

482
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,360
My goodness.

483
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,080
You startled me.

484
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,320
Clear.

485
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,519
It's so clear.

486
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,640
What's so clear?

487
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,840
The more he runs,

488
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,520
the closer she gets.

489
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,320
- What... - Don't ask.

490
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,680
I won't say anything else.

491
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,640
Unless you bring these two

492
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,080
to see me here.

493
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,520
Yes, Mom.

494
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,800
What?

495
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,720
Tomorrow?

496
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,440
(Phuket)

497
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,000
Hello.

498
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,720
Show me that file again.

499
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,640
Auntie Sajee.

500
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,840
- Hello. - My dear.

501
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,960
- I miss you so much. - I miss you, too.

502
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,960
- Are you a bit skinnier? - Hello, Mom.

503
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,319
You gave Moei too much work. I know it.

504
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,400
Thanks for a warm welcome, Mom.

505
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,599
My own son doesn't really know how to please me.

506
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,560
My friend's daughter can do way better, right?

507
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,439
Let's get something to fatten you up.

508
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,919
I prepared lots of food for you.

509
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,959
- Really? - Yes.

510
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,400
- Let's go. - Mom? What about me?

511
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,359
I'm her son, no?

512
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,999
Just follow them.

513
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,720
No one will arrest you. Just blend in as always.

514
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,400
Why should I say it all the time?

515
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,920
Right. Mom.

516
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,840
Don't you know how busy I am these days?

517
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,160
Since you're both here,

518
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,360
you might as well make it your honeymoon.

519
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,560
You may get lucky and give me my grandchild.

520
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,520
Are you that exciting?

521
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,800
- Auntie Sajee. - Yes?

522
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,919
May I go and see my mom?

523
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,840
Fine. You should go with her.

524
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,360
Hang on a minute, Mom.

525
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,560
I've just arrived. Now you're chasing me away.

526
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Auntie Sajee.

527
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,920
He must be tired. Please let him rest.

528
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Really?

529
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,280
All right then.

530
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,559
Come on, Mom.

531
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,919
Moei just said a few words.

532
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,439
And you always agreed with her.

533
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,080
Of course. She's my beloved daughter.

534
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,280
- Sathit. - Yes, ma'am.

535
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,320
Get a car out. I'll go with Moei.

536
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,880
Yes, ma'am.

537
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,120
Wait.

538
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,560
What about me?

539
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,240
Why? You can walk back.

540
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,400
Mom.

541
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,160
- Walk back? - Sathit.

542
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,999
Hang on a minute.

543
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Our house is at the beginning of the alley.

544
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,480
Moei's is at the end.

545
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,280
- You have to pass ours first. - Yes.

546
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,000
- So I can ride with you. - No, you can't.

547
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,680
- Why not? - I won't allow that.

548
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,600
You walk home yourself. Let's go.

549
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,880
- I'll get the car now. - Okay. Let's go.

550
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,680
- Aunt Sajee. - Hmm?

551
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,840
We can actually let him ride with us.

552
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,720
If he does, how can I talk to you privately?

553
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,200
What would you like to talk to me about?

554
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,480
I have a favor to ask you.

555
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,080
I can't get over him.

556
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,280
I must have completely

557
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,840
fallen for him.

558
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,920
What are you doing down here?

559
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,200
It's still early.

560
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,600
What are you doing?

561
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm about to cook rice.

562
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,240
Sticky rice, actually.

563
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,479
I'll make mango with sticky rice and durian too.

564
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,000
I got some orders for a few days now.

565
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,200
And these mangoes are just perfectly ripe.

566
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,560
So I'll make it now.

567
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,360
And I got durians delivered since yesterday.

568
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,880
What a long answer for my short question.

569
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,080
Is there anything I can help?

570
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,440
Huh?

571
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,320
Are you for real?

572
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,480
Hey.

573
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,880
Do you think I am a liar?

574
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,000
I think

575
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,280
you should go

576
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,040
brush your teeth and wash your face first.

577
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,160
I'll get your brush

578
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,720
and facial wash for you.

579
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,760
I never thought

580
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,280
you knew how to use the water dipper.

581
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,480
Even a 3-year-old knows how to use a dipper.

582
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,760
Are you insulting me?

583
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,600
Are you saying I'm a snob?

584
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,920
You're overthinking.

585
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,920
Who would dare insulting you?

586
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,080
Right?

587
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,000
Never seen someone brushing teeth?

588
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,120
Of course I have.

589
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,880
I just never saw you brushing teeth this close.

590
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,680
Look at you.

591
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,440
Your mouth is full of foam now.

592
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,000
You still look cute.

593
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,599
You're teasing me.

594
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,200
See? You're really cute doing this.

595
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,839
Gosh! It got into my eyes.

596
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,320
I'll wash it off for you.

597
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,000
Are you all right now?

598
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,520
You're all wet.

599
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,080
Of course I am.

600
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,760
Come on.

601
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,760
I'll dry it off for you.

602
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,640
- Moei. Wait. - Can you stop moving?

603
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,160
I said it's all right.

604
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,920
Clean it up.

605
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,280
Hey, Thian. No!

606
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,359
What are you doing?

607
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,920
- Stop it. - Why?

608
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,520
You want to burn my house?

609
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,280
What? What did I do wrong?

610
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,400
This is wrong.

611
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,200
It's oil, isn't it?

612
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,000
You can't just pour it like that.

613
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,600
Step back a bit.

614
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,680
I'll show you how to do it.

615
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,240
This is a tinder.

616
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,760
You put it in.

617
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,960
Follow with a piece of coal.

618
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,960
You want three more boxes?

619
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,080
All right. You got it.

620
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,960
Okay. I'll deliver them right away.

621
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,080
Thank you. Bye.

622
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,400
Thian.

623
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,800
What are you doing?

624
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,960
You're delivering them, aren't you?

625
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,960
Let's go.

626
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,000
Why is he so kind today?

627
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,120
- I gotcha. - Whoa. What are you doing?

628
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,839
It annoys me, the way you play with the water.

629
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,800
You wanted to play but you wouldn't. Why?

630
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,320
- Come on. - No, don't.

631
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,800
I don't want to get in the water.

632
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,440
I only want to wet my feet.

633
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,959
What's the fun in that?

634
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,800
It's only fun when you get all wet in the water.

635
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,400
- Come on. - No, please. Thian.

636
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,640
Please. I'm scared.

637
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,360
I'm scared.

638
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,600
Moei.

639
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,560
I'm scared.

640
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,640
What's the matter?

641
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,280
Don't tell me you're scared of the water.

642
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,120
I...

643
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,240
I didn't know you couldn't swim.

644
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,000
There're lots of things you don't know about me.

645
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,760
What do you mean?

646
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,640
Where have you been?

647
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,960
What took you so long to show up?

648
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,359
You are mocking me.

649
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,159
I guess you're all right now.

650
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,719
Look at your grumpy little face.

651
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,960
Stop it now.

652
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,360
See? You're well now.

653
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,280
Actually, I can swim.

654
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,680
But once I was almost drowned.

655
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,120
That's why I'm scared.

656
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,680
Then fight your fear.

657
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,040
The more you're scared, the more you must do it.

658
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,160
Until you overcome it.

659
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,600
Are you comforting me

660
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,600
or scolding me?

661
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,240
Whatever you see it.

662
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,480
I'm sorry.

663
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,440
I went way too much.

664
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,120
I'm not mad at you.

665
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,160
Smiling?

666
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,680
You scared to death just now.

667
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,640
I'm still alive, aren't I?

668
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,120
See?

669
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,400
Joking with me?

670
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,080
Of course not.

671
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,719
I don't want to be mad

672
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,640
because I want only good memories with you

673
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,600
until the day we get a divorce.

674
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,160
Thian.

675
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,920
Mom isn't home tonight.

676
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,359
You can go home after dinner if you like.

677
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,440
So you can sleep comfortably.

678
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,440
It's all right.

679
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,760
I can sleep here.

680
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,200
- What the... - Oyster omelet.

681
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,679
Stir-fried oyster with basil.

682
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,000
- Oyster spicy salad. - Hang on.

683
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,800
You just dig in.

684
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,400
I'll be right back.

685
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,440
What are you talking about?

686
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,200
What mood booster food?

687
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,320
I know you like fresh oysters.

688
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,520
I saw big ones in the market and thought of you.

689
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,120
Mom.

690
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,480
Just stop trying. I know your plan.

691
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,079
What plan are you talking about?

692
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,199
Mom!

693
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,479
We both know what I mean.

694
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,040
Then you should know very well

695
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,680
what my personal motto is.

696
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,280
Where there's a will,

697
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,080
there's a way.

698
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,880
Yeah, right. That's your motto.

699
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,280
Hello? Mom?

700
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,080
Are you full?

701
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,560
- Let me. - Whoa!

702
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,680
Be careful, all right?

703
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,160
You, be careful.

704
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,560
I will.

705
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,320
I'm full now.

706
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,680
I'll get my work upstairs. You tidy it up.

707
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,920
Okay.

708
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,360
A pure-hearted and innocent little girl

709
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,120
was forced to a get married

710
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,760
with a rich and handsome but cruel male protagonist.

711
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,280
Will there be a day

712
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,880
when my male protagonist in real life

713
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,280
is deeply in love and crazily jealous

714
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,960
and...

715
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,960
Thian. No.

716
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,080
Why not?

717
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,600
I know you love me.

718
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,360
I'll do everything you want me to.

719
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,600
Thian.

720
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,960
Thian.

721
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,920
Thian. Don't.

722
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,559
Please don't.

723
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,600
Don't do it.

724
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,040
Thian. Please don't.

725
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,360
Thian.

726
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,360
Thian. Don't do it.

727
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,800
Stop it. Thian.

728
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,400
I'm begging you.

729
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,480
Please don't.

730
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,000
- Stop it. Thian. - Moei.

731
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,680
- Thian. - Moei!

732
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,360
This way.

733
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,840
Yes?

734
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,720
Can you stop talking in your sleep?

735
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,120
I was talking?

736
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,839
"Thian. Please don't."

737
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,200
"Thian. Please."

738
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,800
"I'm begging you."

739
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,280
What's so wrong with you?

740
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,960
I was sleeping so soundly.

741
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,440
Can I sleep now?

742
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,560
Of course.

743
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,560
Will he ever know

744
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,640
we were almost a real married couple

745
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,800
in my dream?

746
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,160
What do we have for breakfast?

747
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,440
Moei.

748
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Stop it.

749
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,640
Don't do it.

750
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,760
It's ticklish.

751
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,920
- Good morning. - Holy Moly!

752
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,520
I was asking what we're having for breakfast.

753
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,040
We have sausages, ham, and...

754
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,000
fried eggs and some bread.

755
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,000
Moei.

756
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,440
Do you have any problem?

757
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,040
No, no problem.

758
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,080
But you're about to have it.

759
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,760
Gosh! My heart egg is burning!

760
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,560
- Get it done quickly. - Okay.

761
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,480
Nothing is merrier than being happy.

762
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,520
Sometimes,

763
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,880
by just thinking or dreaming about what one wants,

764
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,960
one can be extremely happy.

765
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,320
Right?

766
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,400
Thian. Are you already done eating?

767
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,760
I'm done.

768
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,760
Wait. Thian.

769
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,800
I'd like to ask

770
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,240
if you could help me

771
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,640
with the delivery again today?

772
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,920
Where to?

773
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,480
Around the same neighborhood.

774
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,920
Come on.

775
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,080
Look!

776
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,760
I think

777
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,640
we shouldn't go in.

778
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,520
Just call them to come out.

779
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,280
- Here. - What? No.

780
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,440
Just take it.

781
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,480
You're here.

782
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,520
Welcome to my place. Thian, Moei.

783
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,280
You're here.

784
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,360
Welcome to my place. Thian, Moei.

785
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,560
How do you know my name?

786
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,519
It's me who told the mage.

787
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,600
Mom?

788
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,720
A mage?

789
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,520
What kind of mage is she? Huh?

790
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,320
A physiotherapist?

791
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,200
A massagist? A dentist?

792
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,600
I'm a fortuneteller.

793
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,520
I know. I'm just being sarcastic.

794
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,200
You're into this with Mom

795
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,960
and tricked me here, right?

796
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,799
Stop right there.

797
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,240
Don't you dare blame her.

798
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,439
It's my plan all along.

799
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,440
If I asked you, you would never agree to come.

800
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,839
Do you really think I'll stay now?

801
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,680
Do you really think I'll let you leave?

802
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,120
Sathit.

803
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,440
Sathit.

804
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,000
Move.

805
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,040
I only listen to Madam Sajee.

806
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,919
Do you think I can't hurt you?

807
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,160
- Move. - Stop!

808
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,000
I nearly broke my arm.

809
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,800
It's not broken. Just a twist.

810
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,280
Whoa.

811
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,920
- What are you doing? - She's a foot reader.

812
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,040
- Huh? - It's so clear.

813
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,480
Clear again?

814
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,640
They're soulmates.

815
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,920
They're real soulmates.

816
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,120
You've been soulmates for many past lives.

817
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,400
You're physically his.

818
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,280
Your heart belongs to him.

819
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,480
He's been imprisoning you all this time.

820
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,560
Until you repay him back completely,

821
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,160
you shall lead a happy life together.

822
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,399
How can she repay him?

823
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,000
She has to repay with her life.

824
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,520
- What? - She has to die for him.

825
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,520
That's how she can clear her debt.

826
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,520
Does she really have to die?

827
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,320
Mom.

828
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,640
She's all pale now.

829
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,480
She must be scared of death.

830
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,680
You foul-mouthed.

831
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,440
She doesn't have to die.

832
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,480
Only seriously injured.

833
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,360
But if you could survive that,

834
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,240
- Twins will come. - Twins? Really?

835
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,440
Two babies at once?

836
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,600
That's great.

837
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,280
That will surely be great.

838
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,880
You're just too headstrong.

839
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,360
You have a character of fire.

840
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,200
You burn everyone around you.

841
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,880
Be arrogant all you want. But one day,

842
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,240
you'll lay your heart at her feet.

843
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,440
Here. See?

844
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,280
Madam.

845
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,840
Your son is so stubborn even when married.

846
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,280
Luckily, his wife is quite calm.

847
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,840
Otherwise, it'd be out of control.

848
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,040
Your daughter-in-law is like water.

849
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,960
She gives good vibe

850
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,000
to everyone around her.

851
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,560
Except for one thing.

852
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,480
If she loves someone,

853
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,560
she can do anything for him.

854
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,040
Whoever tries to go against her,

855
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,039
one got to watch out. Because she's like

856
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,320
still waters running deep.

857
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,880
Give me.

858
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,880
No!

859
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,400
Give me your hands.

860
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,680
I thought you only enjoy reading feet.

861
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,680
Keep my words in mind.

862
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,640
It may be hard for water and fire to be together.

863
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,800
But they need to coexist.

864
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,680
Just like the two of you.

865
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,840
No one can ever part you from each other.

866
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,080
Thian.

867
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,320
If someday we really get twins,

868
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,400
how would you like to call them?

869
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,120
Right now,

870
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,040
Alin and Alan are taken.

871
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,400
Storm and Thunder are taken.

872
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,000
And recently,

873
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,320
Margie called her babies, Mika and Mia.

874
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,280
What should we name our children?

875
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,559
How about Mite and Louse?

876
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,000
Sounds like a good team?

877
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,040
Are you really sure

878
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,080
to name them Mite and Louse?

879
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,000
You can't change your mind later.

880
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,480
Moei.

881
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,640
You will never touch even my fingernail.

882
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,440
Just wait and see.

883
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,200
It won't be just your fingernail.

884
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,200
The fortuneteller already said

885
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:10,560
you'd eventually lay your heart at my feet.

886
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,520
Yeah?

887
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,000
If you can really die for me,

888
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,560
that day may come.

889
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,600
Hey, Thian.

890
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,359
We aren't in a novel, you know?

891
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,959
When it's matter of life and death,

892
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,720
it's always every man for himself.

893
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,480
I'll never take the bullet for you like in movies.

894
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,840
Hello.

895
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,680
Hey, my son.

896
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,600
What's your take now?

897
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,440
There's an old saying,

898
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,760
"You tend to get what you despise."

899
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,800
Don't be so confident just yet.

900
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,880
Maybe the old saying, and the fortuneteller,

901
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,160
are both wrong.

902
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,320
You can think whatever you please now.

903
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,800
Just wait and see. Right?

904
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,440
What's with a big smile?

905
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,960
My lawyer told me you consulted him about divorce.

906
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,880
What are you up to?

907
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,560
He told you?

908
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,960
Once I am done with the contract, I'll send to you as soon as possible.

909
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,280
Madam.

910
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,200
Is there something to celebrate?

911
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,400
You look quite lively.

912
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,680
I think I'll get grandchildren soon.

913
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,600
I just don't know yet between Ri and Mon,

914
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,960
or Thian and Moei,

915
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,800
who will get children first.

916
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,680
Madam.

917
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:07,080
I have something about Thian to tell you.

918
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,400
Yes, Mom.

919
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,680
I want a divorce.

920
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,640
I already asked your lawyer.

921
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,080
He confirmed me with legal documents.

922
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,720
He said he could find a way to arrange our divorce

923
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,960
without tarnishing Moei's reputation.

924
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,960
Are you saying you've never

925
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,639
taken care of Moei all this time?

926
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,120
You wanted me to get married.

927
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,520
So I did.

928
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,920
You were the one who came up with the idea.

929
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,440
I already told you.

930
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,440
I only said it to cut it short.

931
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,399
I didn't think you would get serious.

932
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,000
Do you hate her that much?

933
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,520
I don't hate her.

934
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,120
Why would you keep your marriage from others?

935
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,480
Mom.

936
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,280
I keep it a secret for the sake of Moei's future.

937
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,160
After we get divorced,

938
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,680
no one will have to know Moei is once married.

939
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,319
So if you get all your problems solved,

940
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,080
you'll really divorce her?

941
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,160
Yes.

942
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,160
But I can't get a divorce now.

943
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,280
Yada's still causing me troubles.

944
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,520
Thian.

945
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,879
Is there no chance to love her at all?

946
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,879
I know you aren't that stupid

947
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,240
not knowing how she feels about you.

948
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,920
- Can't you just open you heart? - Mom.

949
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,800
Moei isn't a girl I love.

950
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,160
She's not the one I want to marry with.

951
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,680
Can't you understand?

952
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,680
Moei isn't a girl I love.

953
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,120
She's not the one I want to marry with.

954
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,600
Can't you understand?

955
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,760
I'm here to pick you up.

956
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,480
I don't want you to get wet.

957
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,720
Here. An umbrella for you.

958
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,840
You can go.

959
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,160
You go home with her.

960
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,960
I'm off now then.

961
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,920
You heard it, right?

962
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,000
What do you mean?

963
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,920
What I said in there.

964
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,200
Moei isn't a girl I love.

965
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,720
She's not the one I want to marry with.

966
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,640
Yes, I did.

967
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,240
I know.

968
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,640
You've been preparing for a divorce.

969
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,520
It's because.

970
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,680
I'm not the one you want to marry with.

971
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,680
Right?

972
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,440
Moei.

973
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,080
Yes?

974
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,880
So...

975
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,680
What do you think?

976
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,320
That's not a problem.

977
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,320
I'm totally fine with it.

978
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,200
- Whoa! - Moei!

979
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,440
You're so clumsy.

980
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,440
You're all wet now.

981
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,200
So are you.

982
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,640
Get on.

983
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,600
What are you doing?

984
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,000
You just got sprained ankle.

985
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,840
I am alright.

986
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,160
I got her in the same school as yours.

987
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,560
Now you have to take care of her. Got it?

988
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:15,720
Come on, Mom.

989
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,040
She's in ninth grade now.

990
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,720
She can take care of herself.

991
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,999
She could in her previously school.

992
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,400
Shut it, Thian. This boy...

993
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,720
- I'll go... - Where are you going?

994
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,439
- I am not done here. - Mom, I'll...

995
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,680
I am not done talking.

996
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,399
You have to take her to and back from school.

997
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,720
- What? - Don't say no.

998
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,880
You can't say no.

999
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,640
This is an imperative sentence.

1000
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,600
- But she can... - Stop talking back at me.

1001
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,039
If he doesn't do as I said, you tell me.

1002
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,760
I'll get at him right away.

1003
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,160
Mom. I am your son.

1004
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,559
I know you're my son.

1005
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,080
She's like a daughter to me too.

1006
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,160
- I'm your biological son. - I love her as one too.

1007
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,920
Stop it.

1008
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,840
Just do as I told you.

1009
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Thian.

1010
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,440
Is she your girlfriend?

1011
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,200
Girlfriend, your ass.

1012
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,920
Why do you come together then?

1013
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,960
I pass this way. You pass this way.

1014
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,280
- You're just shy. - I'm shy, your ass.

1015
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,200
We have to make a deal.

1016
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,440
Let's do like this.

1017
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,200
I'll pick you up every morning.

1018
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,400
But once we're at school. You don't know me.

1019
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,639
If you spot me, just go somewhere else.

1020
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,560
After school, we go separate way.

1021
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,160
Okay?

1022
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,480
Thian.

1023
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,160
You doing this means lying to your mother.

1024
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,240
Here.

1025
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,440
I'm bribing you.

1026
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,840
Just one?

1027
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,680
Take it.

1028
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,160
Fine.

1029
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,280
What else do you want?

1030
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,320
You have to bribe me every day.

1031
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,840
Then I'll keep my mouth shut.

1032
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,880
Is it a deal?

1033
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,320
You're a crafty one.

1034
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,160
Moei.

1035
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,159
What the heck are you playing?

1036
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,320
You want to catch a cold?

1037
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,160
I want to play in the rain.

1038
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,000
Would you like to join me?

1039
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,040
I used to believe

1040
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,320
you were the least complicated one.

1041
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,520
But how come it turned out

1042
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,040
it's getting harder to read your mind.

1043
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,280
The closer we get,

1044
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,800
the more surprising you are.

1045
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,520
Tonight,

1046
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,920
I'll sleep in my mom's room.

1047
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,200
Thian.

1048
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,400
Are you sure you won't be lonely?

1049
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,800
Who said I'd be lonely?

1050
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,200
It's even better. I get more space.

1051
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,680
Enjoy sleeping in your big bed then.

1052
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,960
Of course I will.

1053
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,920
All right.

1054
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,440
Good night then.

1055
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,960
I'm not the one you want to marry with.

1056
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,880
Right?

1057
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,600
So...

1058
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,120
What do you think?

1059
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,360
That's not a problem.

1060
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,320
I'm totally fine with it.

1061
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,600
- Whoa! - Moei!

1062
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,880
Is it you, Moei?

1063
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,560
Yes, Mom.

1064
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:40,080
Can I sleep here with you tonight?

1065
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,080
What's the matter?

1066
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,880
Why are you crying like a baby?

1067
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,440
Mom.

1068
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,720
Why did you let me get married with him?

1069
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,640
Everyone says you're lucky

1070
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,160
to become a daughter-in-law

1071
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,640
of the owner of biggest hotel in Phuket.

1072
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,759
But I don't really care about wealth

1073
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,200
which we can't take with us after death.

1074
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,920
I am sure my daughter thinks the same.

1075
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,480
I let you get married

1076
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:29,320
because I thought you'd be happy.

1077
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,840
Maybe it's time we have to accept the fact.

1078
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,080
We can't force someone

1079
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,800
who doesn't love us to love us.

1080
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,400
Okay.

1081
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,480
(Phuket)

1082
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,240
(Bangkok)

1083
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,040
Since you have improper feelings for me,

1084
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,640
and have failed to be a good body-shield,

1085
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,680
I have to send you away from me

1086
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,760
until you can stop your overly falling for me.

1087
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,320
- Moei. - Yes?

1088
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,119
What is it?

1089
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,960
- Would you like to work abroad? - Huh?

1090
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,160
You want me to work abroad?

1091
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:02,520
Are you interested?

1092
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,760
Of course I am.

1093
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:09,760
I have never been abroad in my life.

1094
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:13,520
If my mom knows, she'll be happy for me.

1095
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,560
What kind of project is it?

1096
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,080
Not now.

1097
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,560
- When am I going... - Can you stop asking?

1098
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,800
I'll tell you when the time comes.

1099
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,360
But right now, I'll get you work your butt off

1100
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,000
and have no time to think about me.

1101
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,800
- Bind them all into books. - What?

1102
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,760
Binding all these?

1103
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,360
Yes, all.

1104
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,000
Is it too hard to understand?

1105
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,240
No, it's not.

1106
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,480
I'll do it.

1107
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,600
You have ten minutes to finish it.

1108
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:51,079
What? Ten minutes?

1109
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:52,080
Yes.

1110
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,839
Walking will just spend it all.

1111
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,000
Are you complaining?

1112
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,520
I'm not.

1113
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,840
I'll get it done.

1114
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,320
Can I help?

1115
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,840
It's all right.

1116
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,280
Okay, then.

1117
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,680
Thian, you brat. She's an architect assistant,

1118
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,919
not an administrator.

1119
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,080
So what?

1120
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,360
It doesn't matter what position she is.

1121
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,439
If she can't do such a simple task,

1122
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,439
don't think to be an architect assistant.

1123
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,360
You're a real grumpy evil!

1124
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,000
- How could you be such a bully? - So what?

1125
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,360
I hate you.

1126
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,200
It's done.

1127
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,760
What are these?

1128
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,720
The documents you asked me to bind into books.

1129
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:36,960
Yes, I know.

1130
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,760
But this isn't how I wanted it.

1131
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,520
The documents are all punched now.

1132
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,160
I wanted you to do it this way.

1133
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,280
Why didn't you ask?

1134
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,480
Reprint them all.

1135
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,720
And bind them all.

1136
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,080
All of them?

1137
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,560
All right.

1138
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,760
Forget something?

1139
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,240
Yes?

1140
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,200
Thank you.

1141
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,040
Which one? Where's the girl from Hammoc?

1142
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,800
Thian's assistant.

1143
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,360
That girl.

1144
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,440
She's plain-looking.

1145
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,320
And she's super short.

1146
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,599
I'm sure.

1147
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,240
She's not Thian's type.

1148
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,280
I'm certain she's a quiet slut.

1149
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,040
She's from Hammoc, right?

1150
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,639
(Natheerin Sawadhirat, Thiarawat's assistant)

1151
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,720
Natheerin Sawadhirat.

1152
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,480
An interior designer from Hammoc.

1153
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,160
Why did he need an interior designer as assistant?

1154
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,240
Requisition, please?

1155
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,760
Hammoc.

1156
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,280
Is it the company that merged with TPC?

1157
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:32,000
Why did he get an assistant from a crappy company?

1158
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,600
Hey, you there.

1159
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,600
You'd better watch your words.

1160
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,680
What crappy company?

1161
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,600
I'm so sorry.

1162
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,480
I was gossiping.

1163
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,800
I didn't know someone's listening.

1164
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,880
What if I started the gossip too?

1165
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,200
Your company sucks.

1166
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:56,000
Because you have an incompetent team leader.

1167
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,240
Don't talk about Thian like that.

1168
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,360
If he's that good,

1169
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,640
why would he ask for help from our company?

1170
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:07,519
I'm not sure if he asked, or she offered herself.

1171
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,960
You'd better watch it.

1172
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,560
You're also a girl. How could you say that?

1173
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,480
Because I am a girl. That's why I know.

1174
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:18,120
And if it weren't for help from TPC,

1175
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,879
I guess Hammoc wouldn't still stand today.

1176
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,920
I'll prove to all of you

1177
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:28,760
all Hammoc's employees have pride.

1178
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,840
And we're far better that you thought.

1179
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,480
Can I have what I asked?

1180
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,520
I look forward to that day.

1181
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,040
You want it now?

1182
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,920
This is so frustrating.

1183
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,880
You know how pitiful Moei is now?

1184
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,400
She's asked to do all things.

1185
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,960
They even gossip about her trying to seduce TecTien.

1186
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,960
You should go forward and protect her.

1187
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,800
I can't protect any of you like before.

1188
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,440
TecTien is our boss.

1189
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,640
He's evaluating us.

1190
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,560
Besides,

1191
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,320
Moei is already married.

1192
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,120
It's not appropriate for me to protect her.

1193
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,160
Oh, poor Kob.

1194
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,920
Oh, my goodness.

1195
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,160
- Are you all right? - I'm okay.

1196
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,000
TecTien is mine.

1197
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,840
Don't you dare steal him.

1198
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,040
TecTien is mine.

1199
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,120
Don't you dare steal him.

1200
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,679
Hey.

1201
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,880
You tripped my friend on purpose.

1202
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,280
Why did you do that? You evil woman!

1203
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,399
Toom. Stop it.

1204
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,639
- Toom. - Gosh!

1205
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,240
- Toom. - She's going to get it.

1206
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,280
You funny-looking bangs!

1207
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,440
Toon.

1208
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,000
I have bangs too.

1209
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,040
Come on. Help me tidy it up.

1210
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,160
It's a mess now.

1211
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,920
Hello, Ms. Ratchada.

1212
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,240
You're Natheerin, Thiarawat's assistant, right?

1213
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,320
Yes.

1214
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,840
Mr. Baramee wants to see you.

1215
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,880
Hammoc must have caused some troubles, right?

1216
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,280
It's none of your business.

1217
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,480
This way, please.

1218
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,320
Don't worry. It's okay.

1219
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,760
Hello, Mr. Baramee.

1220
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,600
It's such a pity.

1221
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,240
I wish we could meet under better circumstance.

1222
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,519
I guess you must have heard.

1223
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,400
Hammoc isn't in a good condition now.

1224
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,480
Not before long until we get the evaluation.

1225
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,000
It's possible I have to shut down your company.

1226
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,080
I have heard about this issue.

1227
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,440
But why do you want to see me?

1228
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:15,160
Are you giving us a chance to prove ourselves?

1229
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,640
A coffee for you.

1230
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,080
You may be sleepy in the afternoon.

1231
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,720
So I made you a coffee.

1232
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Here.

1233
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,160
Where have you been?

1234
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,120
Break time was over long ago.

1235
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,279
I was washing my shirt.

1236
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,440
It got stained.

1237
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,840
See?

1238
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,040
What is it?

1239
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,200
Is it good?

1240
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,160
It's all right.

1241
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,840
Just all right?

1242
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,520
Why?

1243
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,000
Thian.

1244
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,880
Don't you feel anything?

1245
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,560
Why?

1246
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,000
What should I feel?

1247
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,440
I dropped a love potion in it.

1248
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,000
Go back to work.

1249
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,400
Stop all your nonsense.

1250
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,880
Wait.

1251
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,600
Yes?

1252
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,000
See those books?

1253
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,920
- Yes. - Read them all.

1254
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,240
All of them?

1255
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,440
Yes.

1256
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,160
But

1257
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,839
they are all in English.

1258
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,840
So? Google it if you don't understand.

1259
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,040
All right.

1260
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,520
Thian. Don't leave just yet.

1261
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,719
Let me get this straight.

1262
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,400
Why can't you just go easy on her?

1263
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,280
- Yeah. - Look at her messy hair.

1264
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,200
Why are you so bossy? What's with you?

1265
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,960
Exactly. Can you read them all in one day?

1266
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,040
Are you sick, man?

1267
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,720
- Do you hate her that much? - Can't you stop it?

1268
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,680
It won't kill her.

1269
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,960
Because of this cute little face,

1270
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,200
that's why no one knows

1271
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,440
how crafty you are.

1272
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,000
Wake up! How are you doing?

1273
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,880
CM. You understand everything?

1274
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,160
The Engineering Management you wanted me to read?

1275
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,399
I nearly finish them.

1276
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,720
Only a few left.

1277
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,600
That's EM.

1278
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:42,600
I'm talking about CM. Construction Management.

1279
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,600
Hang on a second.

1280
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,400
You're reading about EM.

1281
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,720
Engineering Management.

1282
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,880
They're for engineers to read.

1283
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,080
They're for specialized areas.

1284
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,399
I wanted you to read about CM, you need to understand a big picture,

1285
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,520
but know every process from the start to finish.

1286
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,479
But they're books from the shelf you told me.

1287
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,520
Oh.

1288
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,360
Really?

1289
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,200
I guess I picked the wrong one for you.

1290
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,800
What?

1291
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,160
Just like that?

1292
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,840
Picked the wrong one?

1293
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:20,960
Hey.

1294
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,160
When are you going to read this?

1295
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,760
You're supposed to read this one first.

1296
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,920
I can't read it today.

1297
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,520
I ordered you to read, not set them aside.

1298
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,880
Finish them all by tomorrow.

1299
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,080
- I will. - Good.

1300
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,160
This is just the beginning.

1301
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,760
If you want to work with me,

1302
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,680
you have to be hard-working and patient.

1303
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:47,160
No matter who you are, I don't care.

1304
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,480
Yes.

1305
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:53,280
Moei. You can ask me if you don't understand.

1306
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,720
I really thank you all.

1307
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,200
You're so kind to me.

1308
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,239
Not cruel like someone.

1309
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:01,520
Who are you talking about?

1310
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,879
With yours mouth, read five more books.

1311
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,199
No. Thian. Wait. No!

1312
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,200
Thian. I don't want more.

1313
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,200
Please, don't. I can't read them anymore.

1314
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:16,680
Aren't you a cunning one?

1315
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,720
No, I'm not.

1316
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:24,520
If you weren't my friend, I'd hit you hard.

1317
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,280
I am okay.

1318
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,280
I'm totally fine.

1319
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,600
- You're fine? - Whoa.

1320
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,240
Summarize everything and send to my email tonight.

1321
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,040
Construction Management.

1322
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,320
Look at the camera.

1323
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,800
What's with a sigh?

1324
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,600
I guess

1325
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,920
she's still working with all hair messy.

1326
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,520
This is just the beginning.

1327
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,240
How's that?

1328
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,040
You're having a good mood without me.

1329
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,000
Am I jealous of a cat?

1330
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,040
It's done.

1331
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,200
Hey.

1332
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,120
How can you get in here?

1333
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,480
Look. I bought your favorite.

1334
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,240
I got some for your sister.

1335
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:36,960
No.

1336
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,600
For your wife too.

1337
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:41,520
Is she inside?

1338
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,320
She's inside or not, it's none of your business.

1339
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,200
Let me put these inside first.

1340
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,400
It's heavy.

1341
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:52,400
Hey. Yada.

1342
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:53,680
Yada.

1343
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:57,560
Yada.

1344
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,040
Don't you get it?

1345
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:02,200
I want you to leave and never come back.

1346
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,160
Hey.

1347
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,760
Can you stop pushing me away?

1348
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,480
I've missed you like crazy.

1349
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,480
Thian.

1350
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,280
I can do anything for you.

1351
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,880
I can even be your mistress.

1352
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,360
Why are you so stubborn?

1353
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,320
Because I love you.

1354
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:48,240
Yada.

1355
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,440
Yada.

1356
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,560
Yada.

1357
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,680
Yada.

1358
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,800
Yada.

1359
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,200
- What's going on? - Thian.

1360
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,680
Your computer was hacked.

1361
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:06,280
It never happened in our company before.

1362
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,319
Can I see the footage at the hallway?

1363
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,479
That's Yada.

1364
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,960
Who exactly owns Thian?

1365
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,760
You should spend more time with Moei.

1366
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,320
This is a chance for you to prove

1367
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,880
whether Hammoc should stay or leave.

1368
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,520
What's going on? How can I help?

1369
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,040
"Only you can stop all this.

1370
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,560
Just come back to me.

1371
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,240
And I'll end everything,

1372
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
My love"
