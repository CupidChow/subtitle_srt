1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,960
How many people will there be in our lives

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,520
whom we will always miss?

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,240
Do you still remember where,

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,720
when, and with whom

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,040
you had your first love?

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,880
Hello, everyone.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,080
I'm Natheerin Sawadhirat.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,080
Today is my first day here.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,160
Please be friends with me.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,080
Hang on.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,000
You're so cute. What grade are you in?

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,680
What are you doing?

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,920
Have you ever fallen for someone

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,920
whose face you have never seen before?

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,760
I guess many of you may have fallen for

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,440
and secretly admired someone

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,760
without them ever seeing

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,640
or knowing

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,440
that they were

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,640
your first love.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,000
And your happiness

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,240
was just to look at them from somewhere,

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,560
near or far.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,080
Hoping that one day,

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,760
fate might bring them to meet you

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,160
or even stay beside you.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,640
Will Thian still remember a girl named Natheerin?

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,720
I guess no one would know

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,840
until we meet again.

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,240
Be careful with your heart, Dear.

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Don't give your whole heart to him.

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,840
Because one day,

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,520
once all problems are solved,

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,800
you will have to leave.

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,640
I don't want to see you hurt.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,360
I want you to think

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,920
that you're doing this only to help him.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
All right, Mom.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Can you see that?

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
Even the sky is about to cry over my fate.

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,360
What was that for?

42
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
For your nonsense.

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,120
They forecasted a storm, it has nothing to do with you.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,200
You should get ready.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,040
I need the bathroom.

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Thian.

47
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,880
I need to pee.

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
The auspicious time is soon.

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,760
Or should I wet myself?

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,600
Hmm?

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,680
It's tough being a groom.

52
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,160
I can't even take a piss.

53
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,720
Don't take too long.

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,720
Amen.

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,480
With my singleness and virginity,

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,560
may the rain hold off today.

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,240
Amen. Amen. Amen.

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Please!

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,360
Which side should it go? Okay, abracadabra.

60
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,520
May my wish come true.

61
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,280
So is it taken care of ?

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,520
Yes, Ma'am. It's done.

63
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680
Okay, good.

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,800
Dear lord, please hold off the rain.

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,600
Please wait until after the ceremony.

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,440
Please, my lord. Amen.

67
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,080
Amen.

68
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,600
Yes, Dear.

69
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,960
Don't worry. He'll be here soon.

70
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
- Don't worry. - All right.

71
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,880
Ri, is your brother taking a piss in England?

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,480
Why is he taking so long?

73
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,080
It's about auspicious time.

74
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,840
Let me catch a flight and go get him.

75
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,760
Make it quick. Go.

76
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,280
- I'll be right back. - Hurry.

77
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,560
He'll be here soon.

78
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,520
Thian.

79
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,560
Sorry.

80
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,240
Thian, what's taking you so long?

81
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,640
Are you cleaning the toilet?

82
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,320
Thian.

83
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,800
Hey.

84
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,560
Just come out if you're done.

85
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,160
Thian.

86
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,480
Thian.

87
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,640
Thian.

88
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,040
Mon, my right eye keeps twitching.

89
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,920
Can you go get Ri and Thian?

90
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,520
- Yes, Mom. - Go.

91
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
Gosh.

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,640
Ri is here.

93
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,040
Where's Thian?

94
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,280
Where's Thian?

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120
He’ll come, dear.

96
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
Hey, sit yourself down.

97
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,520
Calm down, Mom.

98
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
Just leave it to me.

99
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,920
Gosh, this brat.

100
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,080
Look at him.

101
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,360
Put the ring on.

102
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,080
(Two weeks ago)

103
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,760
(Pon)

104
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,480
(Yada)

105
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,000
I got some info you asked me to look into.

106
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,400
Just ignore it.

107
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,160
You should take it.

108
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
Too many times already.

109
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,280
I just don't want to.

110
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
Fine.

111
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,080
- I'll take it. - Don't!

112
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,320
- No. - Yada.

113
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,600
Why don't you want me to take this call?

114
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,160
Are you seeing someone else?

115
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,280
Thian.

116
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,320
How could I have someone else?

117
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,800
Let's just ignore it

118
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,240
and continue where we left off.

119
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,280
How dare you cheating on me?

120
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,080
Who's that?

121
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,840
- Thian, no! - Stop!

122
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,400
Who are you?

123
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,960
Who am I?

124
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,400
I'm Yada's husband.

125
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
You're having an affair with my wife.

126
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,800
Thian, listen to me.

127
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,320
You told me you were single.

128
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,520
So what was that about?

129
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,800
All right, I am married.

130
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,640
But we've been arguing.

131
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,079
I'm about to file a divorce.

132
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,440
You're about to but you haven't.

133
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,840
You lied to me.

134
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,280
You have destroyed my trust.

135
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,399
Thian, I didn't mean to lie to you.

136
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,440
Hey.

137
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,920
From now on, we are over.

138
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,640
Thian.

139
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,519
Please listen to me, I don't love him anymore.

140
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,880
- Don't go, Thian. - Let go!

141
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
Stop, Thian, you can't go.

142
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,760
Oh!

143
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,920
Moei!

144
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,000
Thian.

145
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,920
Stop right there, Moei.

146
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,680
I told you not to drag the trash.

147
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,199
I didn't know you were already back.

148
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,920
I'm still cleaning up.

149
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,280
If the rooster doesn't crow,

150
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,320
you can't find the way home, can you?

151
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,240
What is there to eat?

152
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,080
Omelet, stuffed bitter gourd and fried tofu with gravy sauce

153
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,080
left from the alms offering this morning.

154
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,480
I'll get you some rice.

155
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,400
Hunger really wins it all.

156
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,640
- Mom? What brings you here? - Hmm?

157
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,240
Why can't I be here? This is my house.

158
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,399
When did you come?

159
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,520
Last night.

160
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,199
Hey, don't look at her that way.

161
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,519
She didn't tell on you.

162
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,919
I knew it with my gut feelings

163
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,199
that you were out all night being skanky.

164
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,720
- You did, didn't you? - Come on, Mom.

165
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,039
- Did you say "skanky"? - Yes.

166
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,240
- Not a bit too harsh? - Not at all, it's the truth.

167
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,040
- I was just… - Well,

168
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,640
I'll go finish my chores.

169
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,240
I'll get some sleep too, I'm so sleepy.

170
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,600
Oh, really? Stop right there.

171
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,999
Not another step.

172
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,960
Do not try to run away. You didn't care staying home.

173
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,839
You chose to stay out all night and didn't sleep.

174
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,880
Don't use that as an excuse not to talk to me.

175
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,199
When will you stop making me worried?

176
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,599
When will you get married like your brother?

177
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
You can't keep changing women forever.

178
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,200
I haven't met the right person.

179
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,320
Not yet?

180
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,839
Then you should marry Moei.

181
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
What?

182
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,120
- Moei? - Yes.

183
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,120
I'll never marry her.

184
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,000
- Why not? - Look at her.

185
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,680
She's just a kid.

186
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,280
Are you blind? She has all boobs and booties just like your women.

187
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,160
But she's not my type.

188
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,359
You keep saying she's not your type. You'd better watch out.

189
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,000
As the old saying goes,

190
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,440
you'll end up with what you hate.

191
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
If one day you happen to fall for her,

192
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,480
I'll laugh until all my teeth come off.

193
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,559
You will never get to do that.

194
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,320
- Why? - That day will never come.

195
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
How can you be certain?

196
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,560
I'll wait and see.

197
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,320
You do have boobs

198
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,760
but tiny.

199
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,240
How are you holding up, Moei? He's such a pain in the neck, right?

200
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,000
No, I'm used to his extreme behavior.

201
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,680
So don't worry about it, this is nothing.

202
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,520
That's very nice of you to say.

203
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,880
You're so optimistic.

204
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,960
I'll be running errands all day.

205
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,040
- So I'll probably stay over at Ri's home, okay? - Yes.

206
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,879
I don't want to see his face.

207
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,480
He doesn't even come to take care of his own mom.

208
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,240
By the way, don't forget...

209
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,080
If Thian picks on me,

210
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,160
I can give you a call anytime, am I right?

211
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,280
I really made the right decision to let you keep an eye on him.

212
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,600
What?

213
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,200
Aunt Pha's daughter will be staying with us?

214
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,360
Yes.

215
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,879
- But I think... - If that makes you uncomfortable, we won't bother.

216
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,880
- It's no problem at all. - Well…

217
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,880
What? Do you have problem with her living here?

218
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,560
Ri and I are both men in this house.

219
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,840
But she's a girl, Mom.

220
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,720
So? What's the problem with that?

221
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,240
No, Mom, how can she stay with us? It's not...

222
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,560
Listen.

223
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,640
Moei is like your little sister.

224
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,840
Both of you should protect and take care of her.

225
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,080
She doesn't know anyone here in Bangkok.

226
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,160
How can you let her stay at a dorm by herself?

227
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,400
- But... - You're doing the right thing, Mom.

228
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Right?

229
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,160
By the way…

230
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,960
Congrats, you're a freshman now. Well done.

231
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,000
Bad dream again.

232
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,320
Come here.

233
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,800
Why won't you let me bathe you?

234
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,280
- Come here. - Moei.

235
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,640
I'm going out.

236
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,760
Watch over the house, you two.

237
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,360
Where are you going?

238
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,320
Come here.

239
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,000
So where are you going?

240
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,600
Thian, you don't want to tell me.

241
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,520
You're going out to see a woman, aren't you?

242
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
So what?

243
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,520
If you are seeing someone, let her visit us sometimes.

244
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,120
I'll cook my best dishes to treat my sister-in-law.

245
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm all wet now.

246
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,120
Drive safely.

247
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,600
Don't come home late. Aunt Sajee might come over.

248
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,200
Just don't tell her about this.

249
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,120
Oyua, say bye.

250
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,840
Bye.

251
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,560
Bye.

252
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,960
Come on, let's get back inside.

253
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Okay?

254
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,480
Let's get inside.

255
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,760
All right, there you go.

256
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,840
Oh.

257
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,800
He forgot his phone.

258
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,120
I hope he doesn't double-book his dates that would be a total disaster.

259
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,880
(I know you're meeting my wife.)

260
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,000
(I know you're meeting my wife. Don't come if you don't want to die!)

261
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
What is it you want to talk?

262
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,880
You've got 15 minutes.

263
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,160
Please don't talk this way.

264
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,480
I only wish to part with you on good terms.

265
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,600
How can you still ask for good terms after all this?

266
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,960
Do you still…

267
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,840
remember the first day we met

268
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,720
when you saved me from getting hit by a car?

269
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,200
Aren't you going to ask what happened to me?

270
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,480
It's your personal life.

271
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,880
You don't need to tell me that.

272
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,440
You treated my wounds that day.

273
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,000
And I told you.

274
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,600
I didn't want to go to the hospital.

275
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,960
It wasn't that I was scared of doctors.

276
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,160
Rather…

277
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,000
I didn't want anyone to know…

278
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,400
what just happened to me.

279
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,119
Moei?

280
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,200
Ri.

281
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,040
Thian left his phone at home

282
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,240
and I saw a weird message on his screen.

283
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,640
What message?

284
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,320
It sounds like a threat.

285
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,840
Moei, where is Thian?

286
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,560
He went out.

287
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,720
It seems he is meeting someone.

288
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm going after him now.

289
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,280
Moei, wait.

290
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,400
Pon.

291
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,840
Please don't hurt me, Pon.

292
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,480
Troublemaker!

293
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,480
- Let go! - Come here!

294
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,600
Come here!

295
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,480
Why didn't you think before doing it?

296
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,960
- Hmm? - I…

297
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,080
I'm scared now, please.

298
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,240
Scared?

299
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,240
You said you're scared

300
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,280
but you still cheated on me.

301
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,920
Do you know what I hate the most?

302
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,320
Hmm?

303
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,720
Do you?

304
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,880
I hate cheaters.

305
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,840
I hate cheaters!

306
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,039
Troublemaker, come here!

307
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,400
Come with me!

308
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,480
Now!

309
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,560
- You're hurting me. - Come here.

310
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,760
Come here!

311
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,360
Get back here. Where do you think you're going?

312
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,000
- Please, let me go. - Come!

313
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,280
Please let me go.

314
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,040
Let go of me!

315
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,360
- Come here! - Let go!

316
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Come!

317
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,160
- Come! - Pon, please!

318
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,560
Whenever he's angry…

319
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,120
he takes it out on me.

320
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,000
I sympathize and feel sorry for you.

321
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,920
But I'm sorry,

322
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,640
this won't work.

323
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,520
You already have a husband.

324
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,520
I don't want any trouble.

325
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,560
- Please pull over there. - Is it that one?

326
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,760
Follow him.

327
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,040
Hey!

328
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200
Please follow him.

329
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Goodness, why are they driving so aggressively?

330
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,040
Oh, no!

331
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,080
- Oh. - My god.

332
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,280
I just saw a gun.

333
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,400
What?

334
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,320
Ri, Thian is in trouble.

335
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,000
Send me the location now.

336
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,520
Don't do anything yet, I'm coming now.

337
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Okay.

338
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,040
Did something happen to Moei?

339
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,800
Not to Moei, Mom. It's Thian.

340
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
What?

341
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,600
What do we do now?

342
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,840
Please follow them.

343
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,360
Which way should we go?

344
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,880
That way.

345
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
Okay.

346
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Watch out!

347
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,240
Reverse the car! Come on!

348
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,960
Follow him!

349
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,040
Turn right here.

350
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Okay.

351
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,960
Crash into him!

352
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,360
Oh, no!

353
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,320
Push it!

354
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,160
Goodness!

355
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,320
Thian.

356
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
Oh, no!

357
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,400
Oh, no!

358
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,760
The patient had a concussion and passed out in the water.

359
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,199
We did a CT scan of his brain

360
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,200
and didn't find anything unusual or intracerebral hemorrhage. But…

361
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,440
the X-ray shows that

362
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,920
his lungs might have been infected.

363
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,760
I suggest we keep him in the ICU for a while.

364
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,040
Oh dear.

365
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,720
Mother.

366
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,960
Mother.

367
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,840
- Mother. - Hmm?

368
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,960
Ri.

369
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,200
- Thian. - Thian.

370
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,440
- Thian. - Thian.

371
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,080
Thian, how are you feeling?

372
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,800
Can you hear me, Dear?

373
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,400
Thian, it's me.

374
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,840
Are you all right? Are you hurt anywhere? Are you hurt?

375
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,640
You drove into the water.

376
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,720
You're lucky someone saved you in time.

377
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,320
I'll get the doctor to check on you.

378
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,760
- I'll come with you. - Okay.

379
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,880
All right.

380
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,200
Thian.

381
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,880
What is this all about?

382
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,280
Don't think about lying to me.

383
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,520
I know it wasn't an accident.

384
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,000
You got messages while you were unconscious.

385
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,880
(I know you're meeting my wife. Don't come if you don't want to die!)

386
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,040
(That was just a warning.)

387
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,200
(Stop seeing my wife if you don't want to die.)

388
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
Who is that woman?

389
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,240
Your lover is dead.

390
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
That's not true.

391
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You're lying.

392
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,280
Yes, I lied.

393
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,320
Even though he isn't dead

394
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,400
but his life will be suffering.

395
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,440
What did you do to him?

396
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,400
I just taught him a lesson.

397
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,720
So he would learn not to have messed with what is mine.

398
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,880
Wait.

399
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,480
Where is Thian right now?

400
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,880
- Where is he? - Why do you want to know?

401
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,800
You can't help him anyway.

402
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,360
If you're smart enough,

403
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,720
you should behave well with me

404
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,160
to compensate for what you have done.

405
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,920
Are you out of your mind?

406
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,000
Why did you do that to him?

407
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,400
- Why did you do that? - Get a hold of yourself!

408
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,360
It's you who made me do this!

409
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,240
You'd better keep in mind,

410
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,960
even when I don't want you,

411
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,840
you're still mine.

412
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,800
That means...

413
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,480
you can never see anyone behind my back.

414
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,240
Got it?

415
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,800
Thian.

416
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,000
- Moei, hang on. - Yes?

417
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,880
My glasses aren't here, I must have left them in the room.

418
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,480
You go ahead. I'll be right behind you, okay?

419
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,960
I won't be long.

420
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,800
Yada.

421
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Thian.

422
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,960
How are you feeling?

423
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,680
Are you still hurt?

424
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,880
How many times have we met for the last time now?

425
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,720
I'm sorry.

426
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,160
I'm sorry that you got hurt because of me.

427
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,640
Then leave me alone.

428
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,360
No.

429
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,520
Listen, Thian.

430
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,920
I'll divorce my husband.

431
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,680
Please wait for me.

432
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
I won't.

433
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,840
I have no feelings for you.

434
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,080
But you aren't with someone, are you?

435
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,440
How can you be sure about that?

436
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,920
If you did better job probing into my life, you'd have known

437
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,760
I'm not living by myself.

438
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,840
I'm living with a woman.

439
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,280
And she's my girlfriend.

440
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,280
Isn't that your sister, Moei?

441
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,880
Don't you know that she's not my biological sister?

442
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,200
And we are getting married.

443
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,240
Pondej.

444
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,080
Why are you here?

445
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,919
- Let's talk at home. - Move.

446
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,600
- I said... - I said move!

447
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,200
- Hey, what are you... - Stop.

448
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,000
I'll wait and see if you're really getting married.

449
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,640
I'll get someone check the marriage certificate

450
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,440
and see if you're telling the truth.

451
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,200
By the way,

452
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,320
I guess you know who my father is

453
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,960
and what I can do to you.

454
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,640
So next time,

455
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,200
if you ever mess with my wife again,

456
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,240
I won't keep you alive.

457
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,200
Come. Let's go home, Darling.

458
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,320
Come on.

459
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,200
I said let's go. Move.

460
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,000
Hey, let go of me.

461
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,800
- I can walk by myself. - Just go.

462
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,680
I see you got yourself into trouble.

463
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,480
- Mom. - Why didn't you tell me about this?

464
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,640
How much did you hear?

465
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,880
It seems like

466
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,480
your husband is here to take you home.

467
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,239
Pondej, why are you here?

468
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,880
- Let's talk at home. - Move.

469
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,320
- I said... - I said move!

470
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,400
Her husband just showed up like that, you still think to keep it?

471
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,040
Ri had told me everything.

472
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,080
But I think I can handle this.

473
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,560
Can you really?

474
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,160
Sathit.

475
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,400
I need you to look into something urgently. Come see me tomorrow morning.

476
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,479
You'd better recover soon.

477
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,520
So I can arrange things as you told that woman's husband.

478
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,160
- What are you talking about? - You'll get married to Moei.

479
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,640
Are you crazy, Mom?

480
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,039
I won't get married to Moei.

481
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,200
- What? - Never.

482
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,760
You just said you're marrying her.

483
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,679
Do you think he won't check the certificate just like he said?

484
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,560
Listen, even if I hire bodyguards to protect you,

485
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,640
they won't be able to guard you 24-7.

486
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,000
But I told you I can handle this.

487
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,160
Do you have a better solution?

488
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,480
Do you?

489
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,200
- I won't get married. - What?

490
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,400
I won't.

491
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,560
You said you would.

492
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,040
What's wrong with you?

493
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,960
Hey, what's up?

494
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,080
Let's talk inside.

495
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,359
Thian, you know this very well.

496
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,720
- Mom doesn't listen to anyone. - Right.

497
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,280
This marriage is very important.

498
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,760
- Right. - If you don't get married,

499
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,639
that woman won't stop messing with you.

500
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,680
She's right.

501
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,520
Listen.

502
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,280
If her husband comes after you again,

503
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,239
you won't need the ICU. Just go straight to the crematorium.

504
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,360
Are you threatening me?

505
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,919
- Of course not. - Of course not.

506
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,480
Thian, you had an affair with a gangster's wife.

507
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,680
If you don't want to die, you have to get married.

508
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,400
- But I've stopped... - Shut it.

509
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,640
Don't say anything, sit.

510
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,960
Think of how Mom would feel.

511
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,600
When you got hurt,

512
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,120
do you have any idea how she cried her heart out?

513
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,720
Trust me.

514
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,200
Moei is the best solution for you right now.

515
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,360
Can I marry someone else?

516
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,280
I can't bring myself to marry Moei.

517
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,280
Then why did you mention her to that woman?

518
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,000
You ruined her reputation.

519
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,680
You have to take responsibility.

520
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,800
- But I... - Stop it!

521
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,479
If you don't marry Moei,

522
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,160
don't ever call me Mom again.

523
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,440
Mom, wait!

524
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,720
Mom!

525
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,480
My mom and I owe so much to Aunt Jee.

526
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,440
I'm happy to do anything to repay her.

527
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,560
And if this marriage can guarantee your safety,

528
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,360
I'm willing to do that.

529
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,520
Gosh, Thian. Oh this boy...

530
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,640
- Look at him. - Who puts the ring on that finger?

531
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,800
Put it on the ring finger.

532
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,319
How would I know? I've never been married before.

533
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,680
You're getting on my nerves. Haven't you ever watched TV?

534
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,480
- This boy... - It's all right, Jee.

535
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,720
It's not all right. Take it off.

536
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,840
Do it properly.

537
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,520
Take it off now.

538
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,120
Stop pulling a prank already.

539
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,160
Pull it off, pull it harder.

540
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,040
Oh, dear.

541
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,720
Everything is all right.

542
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,320
Now ring finger.

543
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,720
Oh.

544
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,320
What is it?

545
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,679
- The ring is gone, Mom. - What?

546
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,720
What?

547
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,280
What? How can that be?

548
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,600
You were holding it just now.

549
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,639
- But... - Gosh, Thian.

550
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,720
- This is not funny, Thian. - Gosh, Thian.

551
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,639
- I found the ring. - Yeah? Where is it?

552
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,920
It's here.

553
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,799
Oyua has it?

554
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,280
- Yes. - Moei.

555
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,280
Oyua.

556
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,720
Come here, Come to mama.

557
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,440
It's all right. Come on, Oyua.

558
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,840
Oyua.

559
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,360
What's going on?

560
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,600
- Oyua. - Oh hey!

561
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,440
- Oyua. - He's running away.

562
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,559
- Please leave this to me. - Moei, oh, dear.

563
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,200
Don't trip on your skirt.

564
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,200
- Moei. - Be careful.

565
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,680
- Careful, Moei. - I'll help her.

566
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,080
- Come on. - Oyua.

567
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,040
Oyua, come here.

568
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,079
Oyua.

569
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,480
- Moei, don't run. - He's over there.

570
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,160
Be careful, Moei.

571
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,040
Oh, my goodness.

572
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,200
Oyua.

573
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,280
Oyua.

574
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,480
Be careful, Moei. Do not trip.

575
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,120
- Be careful. - He's off again.

576
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,919
Oyua. I'll get him.

577
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,080
- Jee. - Mom, wait.

578
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,880
- Mom. Don't go. - Jee.

579
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
Oyua.

580
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,080
Excuse me, Oyua!

581
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,240
Oyua.

582
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,040
Oyua, give back my son's wedding ring.

583
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,040
Hey, Oyua!

584
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,680
You bad dog!

585
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,400
Please wait for a little while.

586
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,520
Please wait.

587
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,080
I found it!

588
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,120
- Oh, he found it. - He found it, Mom.

589
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,600
- Mom. - He found it.

590
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,119
Take good care of Moei.

591
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,200
Especially you, Thian.

592
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,000
You have to always love and cherish her.

593
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,440
Oh, right.

594
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,880
Give me a grandchild soon.

595
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,000
Oh.

596
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,760
What's this?

597
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,040
Is there a storm coming?

598
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,400
Oh, dear.

599
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,280
Mr. Thian.

600
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,239
Mr. Thian, the sky is clear now.

601
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,880
Mrs. Jee asked me to come and get you.

602
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,640
Your suit is all clean and ready.

603
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Sign it.

604
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,720
Sign it, Thian.

605
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,120
Sign it.

606
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,800
That's it.

607
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,160
(Save The Earth)

608
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,840
I fell for the class president,

609
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,360
and my peer mentor,

610
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,920
and now,

611
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,520
he's going to be my husband.

612
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,360
Duckie, I'm getting married.

613
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,640
All right then.

614
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,200
Mr. Thiarawat and Ms. Natheerin

615
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,960
are now legally husband and wife.

616
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,120
Yes!

617
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,160
Right, I should take this picture.

618
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,720
All right. One, two, three.

619
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,120
Snow.

620
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,680
I'm getting freaking crazy!

621
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,880
Thian.

622
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,360
Hey, calm down. Don't go crazy just yet.

623
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,360
I know you're an artistic type

624
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,359
but can you be one at the right time?

625
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,920
How could you just walk out and leave Moei like that?

626
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,160
I don't want a lecture right now.

627
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,880
I'm already stressed enough.

628
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,639
You think you're the only one stressed out here?

629
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,560
I guess the most stressed out here is Moei.

630
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,800
Listen.

631
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,880
Just think about it.

632
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,120
Instead of finding a good man,

633
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,120
she suddenly had to sacrifice her own happiness

634
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,480
and get married to a guy like you.

635
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,840
Bro, I'm your brother.

636
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,920
Moei is also my sister.

637
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,800
You don't need to worry about her.

638
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,880
She's never been stressed about anything.

639
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,200
How do you know that?

640
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,000
I know what she thinks with just a glance.

641
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,040
Are you that confident?

642
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,200
Yes.

643
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,840
Mr. Thian. Mrs. Jee asked me to come get you for the ceremony.

644
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,600
- What? - What?

645
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,680
What ceremony?

646
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,480
May your love last long.

647
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,120
Not just yet, I'm not done.

648
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,800
You must give her lots of love.

649
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,759
She's your wife now, you must always cherish her.

650
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,359
Don't make me teach you that. Pha, you say something.

651
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,920
If I continue, I might end up scolding him.

652
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,160
All right, go ahead.

653
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,560
I wish you both great happiness.

654
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,120
Forgive each other no matter what.

655
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:30,080
Moei, you have to listen to him from now on.

656
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,960
Yes, Mom.

657
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,439
People may get confused if we don't have the bedding ceremony.

658
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,320
They may doubt if you two really got married.

659
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,639
Just let them be.

660
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,720
How could I do that?

661
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,480
If this gets to Pondej, you'll be dead.

662
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,119
Don't use him as an excuse.

663
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,320
Not at all.

664
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,280
Why? Don't you want to sleep with her?

665
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,600
Mom.

666
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,320
Aunt Pha is still here, can't you see?

667
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,400
She's here and so what?

668
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,359
You really want me and Moei to…

669
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,080
Oh, look at him.

670
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:16,280
Do you really think I will let you and Moei sleep together?

671
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,680
What are you thinking, Thian?

672
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,400
- You're such a pervert. - Yeah.

673
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,640
Why do you have to be so loud?

674
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,840
I'm not being loud. This is my normal tone.

675
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,240
Listen, I only want you two to lie down together as part of the ceremony.

676
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,640
It's only you who think inappropriately.

677
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,599
Mom, I think we should leave,

678
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,600
so these two can make out.

679
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,320
Hey, don't say that.

680
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,080
Well, I mean they can take a rest.

681
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,360
They must be tried.

682
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,080
Okay, come on. Let's go.

683
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,400
After you.

684
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,160
By the way,

685
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,760
don't forget to finish things off before bed.

686
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,920
Mom.

687
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,999
- Mother. - I really love Mom's laugh.

688
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,440
Good luck, Thian.

689
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,200
- Close the door quickly. - Let's go.

690
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,239
- Oh right, Mom. - Hmm?

691
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,919
I think we should lock the door

692
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,120
so he can't run away.

693
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,080
Tie the door with a rope will do too.

694
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,440
You're right.

695
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,320
But after all this, he must have some feelings for her.

696
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,080
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

697
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,240
Hey.

698
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,560
How long are you going to sit there?

699
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,080
Come sit here.

700
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,360
Okay.

701
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,760
So tell me.

702
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,240
Now that you're using my surname,

703
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,280
are you going to be well-behaved

704
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,560
and not getting on my nerves anymore?

705
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,200
That's not it.

706
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,640
It's just that I'm still processing this whole thing.

707
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,680
I understand.

708
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,480
I'm also in shock.

709
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,080
What?

710
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,120
Can you take this off for me?

711
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,720
Take it off?

712
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,200
Excuse me.

713
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,280
Remember what I told you?

714
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,880
Listen.

715
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,760
We have to keep our marriage a secret.

716
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,720
Once everything is over,

717
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,400
we'll get a divorce.

718
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,600
We have to keep our marriage a secret.

719
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,600
We can't let anyone know about it.

720
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,760
I remember.

721
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,920
Very good.

722
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,560
I like it when you're well-behaved like this.

723
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,920
Thian.

724
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,480
What are you doing?

725
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,480
What do husband and wife usually do?

726
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,520
Hey.

727
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,080
Are you all right?

728
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,640
Are you having dirty thoughts?

729
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,000
Uh…

730
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,160
No, I wasn't thinking about anything.

731
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,480
Are you sure?

732
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,680
Yes, I'm sure.

733
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,480
That's good.

734
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,200
I'm going to take a shower.

735
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,360
What was I thinking?

736
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,200
I'm not sleepy yet.

737
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,560
You can go to bed first.

738
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,200
Me neither. You can…

739
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,040
Oh!

740
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,440
Gosh!

741
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,040
Where are you going?

742
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,800
I'll sleep on the floor.

743
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,280
I normally sleep alone.

744
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,000
Having someone else on my bed…

745
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,160
I'm not used to it.

746
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,000
All right.

747
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,720
So I'm just someone else to him.

748
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,560
Thian.

749
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,760
Hmm?

750
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,920
Thian.

751
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,320
What is it now?

752
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,000
Well, I just want to tell you

753
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,880
that I'll sleep on the floor.

754
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,400
You should sleep on your bed.

755
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,760
I said it's all right. Just sleep on the bed.

756
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,480
Well, the floor is hard.

757
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,840
It's not comfortable. You may get a backache, I can sleep on the floor.

758
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,800
It's all right. You sleep on the bed.

759
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,120
Come on, Thian. Please.

760
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,440
- Get on the bed already. - Please, Thian.

761
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,240
- Please, come on. - Gosh!

762
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,800
The floor is hard. You won't feel comfortable.

763
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,680
You're really stubborn.

764
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,200
- Please. You may get backache... - When will I get to sleep?

765
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,200
I'm sorry.

766
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,160
I'm so sorry, Thian.

767
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,520
Oh, does it hurt?

768
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,600
- Of course, it does. - Let me have a look.

769
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,800
Are you crazy? How can you look at it?

770
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,160
Oh, right.

771
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,600
You're right. I can't.

772
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,000
- Then let me... - You just...

773
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,880
stay away from me.

774
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,120
Go over there.

775
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,360
I told you I could sleep on the floor.

776
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,200
See how you've caused trouble?

777
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,440
Okay, fine.

778
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,400
Satisfied now?

779
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,320
- Hey! - No, I don't...

780
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,320
That's not it. I just…

781
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,560
I just want my duckie.

782
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,400
Thank you.

783
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,240
Sweet dream.

784
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:17,640
Even though this marriage may have to end one day,

785
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,480
I'll use every second I have

786
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,960
to love him as much as I can.

787
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,200
Please stop.

788
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,680
Come on.

789
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,960
I'm sorry.

790
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,680
I woke you up, didn't I?

791
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,520
What time is it now?

792
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,760
It's 5 am.

793
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,400
What, 5 am?

794
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,520
Why get up so early?

795
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,920
Mom wants me to cook for the alms offering this morning,

796
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,640
Because today is the first day of our marriage.

797
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,200
Oh, right.

798
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,600
I forgot that we aren't married for real.

799
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,320
- Yes. - You can get back to sleep.

800
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,560
Where are you going?

801
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,800
Get back here.

802
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,600
- No. - There.

803
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,480
Wait for me.

804
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,559
- Come and get me. - Wait up, Mint. My towel came off.

805
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,880
Come and get me.

806
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,480
I'm coming, My lovely Mint.

807
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,119
Are you still there?

808
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,520
Why are you so quiet?

809
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,880
Mint! Don't leave.

810
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,520
Mint! Mint!

811
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,160
Dang it!

812
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,840
Dang!

813
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,040
Ain't it enough doing it outside? Now you had to bring her home?

814
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,280
How nasty.

815
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,800
Nasty?

816
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,840
The one at home is nastier.

817
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,200
All rotten and stinking.

818
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,480
Who would want to have it?

819
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,520
Then let me go!

820
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,640
Let's get a divorce, I won't ask anything from you.

821
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,160
Do you really think after we're divorced,

822
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,480
you can go back to that loser?

823
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,640
Didn't you hear he was getting married?

824
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,680
Do you think he will still want you if you go back to him?

825
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,600
Learn to use your brain!

826
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,720
You stupid!

827
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,760
I don't believe it.

828
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,240
I don't believe he'd get married.

829
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,280
He was lying.

830
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,720
If I go back to him,

831
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,920
he'll definitely choose me.

832
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,960
- Let go of me! - He'll definitely choose you?

833
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,760
Then let's see but I'm telling you

834
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,160
that this time,

835
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,600
he won't be lucky like last time.

836
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,439
So? You want to go to him now?

837
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,519
Do you? Do you?

838
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,040
Let go of me!

839
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,520
You bad guy!

840
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,760
You crazy!

841
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,880
You filthy!

842
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,280
You'd better stop messing with my life.

843
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,480
Let's live our own lives.

844
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,359
I don't want to mess with you,

845
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,719
But you shouldn't ruin your husband's reputation.

846
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,960
I still need his connections.

847
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,720
You only care about yourself.

848
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,240
Do you have any idea

849
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,960
what I had to go through

850
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,440
while living with him?

851
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,400
If it weren't for you,

852
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,400
I wouldn't have married him.

853
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,440
Don't put the blame on me.

854
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,320
I never forced you to marry Pondej.

855
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,760
Think about it carefully.

856
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,040
It was you who wanted to stay with him.

857
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,600
If you hadn't introduced me to him that day,

858
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:57,400
I wouldn't have had to live in hell like I am right now!

859
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,240
Oh!

860
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,600
- Stop it. - Can you hold this, Mom?

861
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,200
Thian, I'll help you.

862
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,080
That's it.

863
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,240
Why are you laughing?

864
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,520
Thian, didn't you sleep well last night?

865
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,760
Maybe you should go home today. So you can sleep better.

866
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,680
There come, the monks.

867
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,320
Luang Phor, this couple just got married.

868
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,920
Didn't we agree to keep it a secret?

869
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,760
How does this kid know about it?

870
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,600
I don't know.

871
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,480
Maybe the guests told him.

872
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,920
Please listen to me well.

873
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,560
Since you two have decided to spend a life together,

874
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,000
I'd like you to remember these four words.

875
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,160
They are "Satya" - sincerity,

876
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,360
"Yama" - forbearance,

877
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,360
"Kanti" - patience,

878
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,120
and "Yaga" - sacrifice.

879
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,360
From now on, I hope you put the common interest of your family first.

880
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,960
If you argue with each other,

881
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,200
please think of these four words.

882
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:56,680
Your married life will then be full of happiness,

883
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,480
and live happily together ever after.

884
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,680
What the heck?

885
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,600
You have to stay at Moei's.

886
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,879
Don't do this, Mom.

887
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,440
It's already bad enough staying there last night.

888
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,640
Otherwise I'll cut you out of my will.

889
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,960
You won't get a single dime from me.

890
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,560
The house you sleep in, the car you drive, are all mine.

891
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,040
I will take everything back.

892
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,320
Mom.

893
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,040
You're a real dictator.

894
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,160
Ri, help me.

895
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,440
- Well, Mom. - You, too.

896
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,079
If you take his side,

897
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,800
you'll be cut out of my will too.

898
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,360
Well…

899
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,960
She wouldn't dare.

900
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,440
- No way. - Thian.

901
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,720
I got to say

902
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,720
you're on your own this time.

903
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,600
I forgot to tell you one thing.

904
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,040
Actually,

905
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,120
I'm a man of justice.

906
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,400
You'd better do as Mom says, Thian.

907
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,200
- Right, Mom? - Yes.

908
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,960
Mon.

909
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,360
Help me.

910
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,960
Well, I agree with whatever Ri says.

911
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,040
No one can help you this time.

912
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,440
Come here and help me take these.

913
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,440
Hurry up and go already.

914
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,760
Learn to help house chores too.

915
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,440
Don't be a burden to them, got it?

916
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,800
My room might be a little tiny.

917
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,680
I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable.

918
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,160
Don't get too excited.

919
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,080
This is just temporary.

920
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,320
Wait!

921
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,320
Don't open it.

922
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,200
Don't, Thian!

923
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,120
Gosh, Moei.

924
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,800
- I just found out a while ago... - What the heck?

925
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,360
that you would be staying here, so....

926
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,120
I couldn't put them away in time.

927
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,400
It's so dusty.

928
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,040
- Moei, what is it? - Thian.

929
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,200
Don't look.

930
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,560
What is it, Moei?

931
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,279
- Hey. - Don't look.

932
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,880
What's it? A lizard?

933
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,000
- A cockroach? - Worse than that!

934
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,519
- I hate cockroach! - Don't, Thian!

935
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,160
Hey, get it away from me!

936
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,040
No, Thian.

937
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,799
Is there a girl in this house?

938
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,920
Hey!

939
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,200
It is an old one.

940
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,240
You can go.

941
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,440
(Application for Registration of Divorce)

942
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,000
Yada!

943
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,080
(Phuket)

944
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,200
(Bangkok)

945
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,520
Here we are. Let's go, Oyua.

946
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,600
Let's get inside.

947
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,040
What's up, Snow?

948
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,039
Come on. This way. Go up.

949
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,160
Up, up, up.

950
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,880
Are you tired, Oyua? Hmm?

951
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,840
Are you tired from flying?

952
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,560
Come on, I'll take it off for you.

953
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,920
Come here.

954
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,560
Okay, now go and play, Oyua.

955
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,280
- Go, Snow. - Go play with Snow.

956
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,160
Oh! Thian!

957
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,320
- Does it hurt? - No.

958
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,440
- I'm terribly sorry. - What are you doing?

959
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:59,640
Well, I saw you were carrying your things in here.

960
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,960
So what?

961
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,200
So…

962
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,440
I thought...

963
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,960
So you're going to stay here too?

964
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,439
I'm just doing what Aunt Jee said.

965
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,680
- She said we are now married. - Umm.

966
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,160
- So we should stay in the same... - Go to your room.

967
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,840
Why do we have to cram in one room?

968
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,440
Listen, this is Bangkok, not Phuket.

969
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,280
No need to act so real.

970
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,200
Don't tell Mom about this.

971
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,080
Okay.

972
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,160
Oh, wait. Thian!

973
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,160
What is it now?

974
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,640
How can you be sure

975
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,640
that man won't come

976
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,920
to check on us here?

977
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,240
Moei.

978
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,519
He's a man, not a gecko.

979
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,520
He won't be climbing the wall to check on us.

980
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,800
Right.

981
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:13,880
Yada!

982
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:16,640
What the hell is this?

983
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,879
You even bring the paper yourself?

984
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,160
Do you really think I'll sign this so you can live happily?

985
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:24,680
Only in your dreams.

986
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,280
Take it.

987
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,160
Come here.

988
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,200
- Let go of me, Pondej. - Come home!

989
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,480
- I won't, let go! - I said come home.

990
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:38,080
I will never go back to live in hell again.

991
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,920
Come here, troublemaker.

992
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:47,800
Yada!

993
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,600
Yada!

994
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,920
Where do you think you are going?

995
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,880
Is it 191? Please help me.

996
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,120
Come here.

997
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,440
Let go of me!

998
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,480
You called 191?

999
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,400
No!

1000
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,560
What are you doing?

1001
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,160
Pondej.

1002
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,560
- What are you doing? - Back off.

1003
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,040
Don't mess with my things.

1004
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,840
- Hey! - Let go!

1005
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,599
What are you doing?

1006
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,040
I said back off!

1007
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,560
No!

1008
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,600
No!

1009
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,120
Pondej!

1010
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:46,000
Why are you doing this to me? Why destroying my things?

1011
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,000
You still have the nerve to ask me why?

1012
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:52,200
Listen, if you are trying to divorce me again,

1013
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,320
I'll burn you instead. Remember that.

1014
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,600
Oyua!

1015
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,960
Give back my paper! It's not a snack. Oyua!

1016
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,480
Oyua!

1017
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:44,880
Oyua!

1018
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,040
Oyua! Stop!

1019
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,120
Come on, give that back to me.

1020
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,720
Come on, Oyua.

1021
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,160
Come on, good boy.

1022
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:57,240
Oyua! You silly dog!

1023
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,720
- I thought you were a ghost asking for merit. - Hey!

1024
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:04,960
Watch it.

1025
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,720
What did you say? Come here.

1026
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,399
Didn't I warn you not to raise a dog?

1027
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,240
Do you see now what mess he could make?

1028
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,120
Unlike my cat. Look.

1029
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,160
She can take care of herself.

1030
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,840
If you can't take care of him, give him to someone else.

1031
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,040
What a mean jerk.

1032
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,800
- What did you say? - What?

1033
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,600
I heard you insulting me just now.

1034
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:26,639
I didn't say anything.

1035
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:27,760
I heard it.

1036
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:28,800
Whoa!

1037
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,760
- Oyua! - Hey, your dog...

1038
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,439
- Snow! - Oyua!

1039
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,000
- Oyua! - Oyua!

1040
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,480
- Snow! - Oyua!

1041
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,000
Oyua!

1042
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,360
Oyua! Stop right there!

1043
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:43,720
Snow!

1044
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:45,960
Hey!

1045
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,480
Snow!

1046
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,120
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

1047
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:13,280
We're all right.

1048
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,760
I'm sorry.

1049
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,440
She wasn't being careful.

1050
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,280
It's all right.

1051
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,360
I'm sorry.

1052
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,240
Here, take him.

1053
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,280
All right. Let's go back inside.

1054
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:16,080
In my thought, among his meanness,

1055
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,680
his kindness is hiding somewhere.

1056
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:23,640
With Oyua, for example, that he didn't seem to get along

1057
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,160
from the very first day.

1058
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,800
- Hey! - Oh!

1059
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,720
Did you feed him again?

1060
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,520
There you go.

1061
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,519
No, I didn't. I didn't feed him.

1062
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,720
Take care of him.

1063
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,160
Okay.

1064
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:01,080
Listen. Don't follow me anymore. Got it?

1065
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,240
You'll get scolded. Just stay here.

1066
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,840
Don't follow me. Go away.

1067
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,720
Thian, wait up!

1068
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,880
Thian.

1069
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,000
- Doctor, please help him. - Doctor.

1070
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,200
Bring him over.

1071
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,600
- Please hand him over. - Okay.

1072
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,520
Is he gonna be all right?

1073
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,840
(I-Oon Veterinary Clinic)

1074
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,240
He's safe now.

1075
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,040
Thank you.

1076
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:52,880
Thian.

1077
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,240
Can't we keep him?

1078
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,880
No.

1079
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,760
He'll bite Snow to death.

1080
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,000
But…

1081
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,040
Do you see that? Let's keep him, please.

1082
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,600
I don't know why

1083
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,680
I hit it off with you since the first time we met.

1084
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:22,480
Umm...

1085
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:26,120
maybe you and I are the same.

1086
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,800
Doggie!

1087
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,840
Doggie!

1088
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,799
Thian. I thank you so much.

1089
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,720
I brought him to watch over the house. Not because of you.

1090
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:54,720
Because in the end, we're raised by kind people.

1091
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,520
My kind person is Aunt Jee.

1092
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,480
And your kind person…

1093
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,000
is Thian.

1094
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,200
Happiness when loving someone

1095
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,800
is to secretly see their good sides.

1096
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:15,360
Even when others may not see those lovely sides at all.

1097
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,000
What is the type of guys you like?

1098
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,320
I like clever guy.

1099
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,400
He's going to be our new team leader.

1100
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,799
I am Thiarawat.

1101
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,640
Just look at her. You really made her your wife?

1102
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:30,920
I don't believe it.

1103
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,680
You're so selfish.

1104
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,800
If I am selfish,

1105
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,240
you only care for money.

1106
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,160
If you couldn't do this easy task,

1107
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,840
how could you do a bigger one?
