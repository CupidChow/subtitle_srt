1
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,400
"Cha-nor a-go chit-teh", Boss.

2
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,160
"Mingalaba".

3
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,400
Am I pretty?

4
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,160
Like a fish hit the edge while escaping.

5
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,440
- Wish for what? - I'll only wish for love.

6
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,200
I really like it when you call yourself "Husband".

7
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,480
But you only have time until tomorrow.

8
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,080
- Just one day? - Yes.

9
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,440
I don't have any more time.

10
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,680
What? I'm shocked, you know.

11
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm leaving Dawei in two days.

12
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,640
I've applied to study in America.

13
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,000
I have to go back and prepare all documents

14
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,920
and resign from the company.

15
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,360
It's time for me to go my own way.

16
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,200
Are you saying

17
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
you'll get a divorce?

18
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,000
Actually, I don't care

19
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,600
whether you'll divorce him or not.

20
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,720
I'm ready to support

21
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,680
whatever you decide.

22
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,760
If it makes you happy.

23
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,600
Hey, Thian! Jeez.

24
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,079
Aren't you a bit too energetic?

25
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,720
- Don't want to take a day off? - Right.

26
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,040
Well, I'm all right.

27
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
So, how is Moei?

28
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,760
Much better. But I let her take more rest.

29
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,400
So where is Nott?

30
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,560
Over there.

31
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,520
Hey.

32
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,520
Do you smell something?

33
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,240
What is it?

34
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
Well, something homo.

35
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,280
- Okay, it's done. - Oh, wait.

36
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,440
- Your shoelace is undone. - Oh, thank you.

37
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,280
- Chet! - Hey!

38
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,400
- Thian. - Hello, Chet.

39
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,640
Hey, why are you back to work already?

40
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,800
How is Moei? Is she better now?

41
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,040
- You. - Not me.

42
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,200
No, Thian. It was me who told him.

43
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Hey. Don't worry, Thian.

44
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,920
I don't have a big mouth.

45
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
- Thank you so much. - Okay. I need you to come with me.

46
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,760
- Oh, okay. - Okay.

47
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,440
- Over here? - What the heck?

48
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
Do you guys smell something?

49
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,480
- Something homo. - Maybe not.

50
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,480
Didn't you see he nearly went right into Nott?

51
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,280
Hey, that's Kob.

52
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,640
Kob, what are you doing here?

53
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,559
- Moei, Tum. - Stop.

54
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,479
- It's good to see you. - Thanks, Tum.

55
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,960
- No worries. - Kob, what are you doing here?

56
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,640
- Have you eaten? - Oh.

57
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,440
Not yet.

58
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,040
Wait for me then.

59
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,480
We might need to use some stones.

60
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,040
- Come on. - Okay, let's take a break.

61
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,280
Let's take a break. Come on. Go.

62
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,280
We still have a lot to do.

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,440
Just have a lunch break and come back quickly.

64
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,600
Hey, it's almost lunchtime. Let's have lunch.

65
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
You go first. I'll come later.

66
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,000
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

67
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
Okay, don't take long.

68
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,280
- Oh, wow. - I cooked it myself.

69
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,080
- Really? - Yes.

70
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,440
Oh, wow.

71
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,160
Boiled rice.

72
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
Yes, it's boiled rice.

73
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,280
- Boiled rice with pork. - Thank you.

74
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,600
- Smell good? - Wow. It sure does.

75
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Let me taste it.

76
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,240
You're so good at cooking.

77
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
- I cooked it myself. - Really?

78
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,000
If you can translate the prayer correctly,

79
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,320
you can have the marriage certificate back.

80
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,720
Liar!

81
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,680
Didn't you say you would come to visit me at lunch?

82
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,960
You have someone taking care of you.

83
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,560
So I thought I didn't need to go see you.

84
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,920
Why? Is taking care of me that tiring?

85
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,760
You know the answer. Why bother ask?

86
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,440
Are you serious about what you told me?

87
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,680
Which one?

88
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,560
I've told you so many things.

89
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm talking about me translating the prayer.

90
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,440
You're not giving up on this easily, are you?

91
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,400
Of course.

92
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,560
I want the marriage certificate back.

93
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,360
Fine, if only you can translate it within today...

94
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
by 6 pm.

95
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,720
You can have the certificate.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,040
Deal.

97
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,080
Hey, hold on.

98
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,799
You want us to translate this prayer?

99
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,880
Yes.

100
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,520
Moei said if I can translate this prayer by 6 pm today,

101
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,040
she'll give me the certificate.

102
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,760
- What if we translate it wrong? - Right.

103
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,200
I'll have to do what she asks.

104
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,840
So, you guys have to do whatever it takes

105
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,360
to get me away from her.

106
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,159
Sure, my friend. It's a piece of cake.

107
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,880
We can do anything for you.

108
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,480
- Am I right? - Yes.

109
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,400
Easy-peasy.

110
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,320
Here you go.

111
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,320
Now, give me the certificate.

112
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,520
- I can't. - Why not?

113
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,280
You translated it wrong.

114
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
What?

115
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,560
Take a seat.

116
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,120
The correct translation is,

117
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,160
"If you agree to cooperate tonight,

118
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,760
you'll get forever love for free

119
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,240
with insurance of sustainability,

120
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,840
and a lifetime guarantee."

121
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
From the Housewife.

122
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,000
See you tonight, Husband.

123
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,600
Hey.

124
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,800
Did you all help her?

125
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,520
You all helped her?

126
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,840
Don't worry, Moei. This is nothing.

127
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,919
That's right. We can do anything for you.

128
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,480
Yes, and tonight we will groom him

129
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,520
and offer him at your door, Master Moei.

130
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,080
- Come on! - Come on!

131
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,440
Come on!

132
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,920
Come on! Thank you so much!

133
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,800
- Come, that's how we do it! - One more time!

134
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,680
Hey, Beer, Nott, Toon. Let me ask you guys something.

135
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,320
Who did the translation for me?

136
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,279
- It was me. - Me, too.

137
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,000
- Me, too. Why? - Yeah.

138
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,680
I want to say that you translated it wrong.

139
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,040
What?

140
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,080
- Oh, my. - What?

141
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,839
- That's impossible. - How could that be?

142
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,960
We did it wrong?

143
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,719
I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry.

144
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,200
Hey, you three conspired

145
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,760
to do this to me, didn't you?

146
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,280
- No! - No, we didn't. Who would do that?

147
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,800
- You're my boss. - That's right.

148
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,680
Come on, Thian.

149
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,279
It's a win-win situation for a man like you.

150
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,600
- That's right. - Right, Chet?

151
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,839
Hey, Thian. I wish for you

152
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,400
to get a lovely wife tonight.

153
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,680
You're a real player, Chet.

154
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,920
- Cheers! - Hey.

155
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,039
How about this?

156
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,400
If you're excited,

157
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,120
then have some alcohol,

158
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,920
- so you'll be relaxed. - Oh, man.

159
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,880
Jeez! They are so loud!

160
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,280
- Be quiet, or you'll get this. - Hey, calm down.

161
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,880
I don't get it how that TecTien jerk

162
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
is better than both of us.

163
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,000
Why does every girl fall for him?

164
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,960
Why?

165
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,520
His look is just average.

166
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,720
He's nothing compared to us.

167
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,240
No, not at all.

168
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,879
Oh, my goodness.

169
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,400
Moei, you look very beautiful.

170
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,640
You're totally lovely.

171
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,960
Hey, why are you drinking so much?

172
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,640
Moei, don't worry.

173
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
We have to get him drunk first.

174
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,519
then he won't run away.

175
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,960
We'll send him to your room.

176
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Things will be smooth and easy.

177
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,760
- Bottoms up! - Come on.

178
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,480
Nice one. Love it.

179
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,720
- Let's drink. - Hey.

180
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,559
Thian, that's enough.

181
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,000
You'll be drunk.

182
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,480
So what?

183
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,680
You think I won't be able to perform if I'm drunk?

184
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,760
Don't look down on me like that.

185
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,080
For a playboy like me,

186
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,880
even if my hands and feet are tied up...

187
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,920
I can still make all the moves.

188
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,680
Nice. That’s my friend.

189
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,959
Hey, Thian. Not yet, man.

190
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Come on, my man, don't rush.

191
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,200
- I'm sorry, Moei. - Don't rush, my friend.

192
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,400
- Calm down. - Hey, don't. I'm okay.

193
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,520
- Hey, Thian. - Easy, Thian.

194
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,240
Move, Beer.

195
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,480
- Thian. - Careful, Thian.

196
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,920
Where are you going?

197
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Where are you going?

198
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,080
- Let go. - Where are you going, Thian?

199
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,120
I'm going to the restroom.

200
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,839
- All right? - Then go upstairs.

201
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,640
- It's upstairs. - Yeah.

202
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,080
- Here, it's this way. - Careful, Thian.

203
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,080
Chet, I can't do it.

204
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,679
- That's too many steps. - Oh.

205
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,560
- Let me go to that one. - You're good with that one?

206
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,000
Careful, Thian.

207
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,760
I'll be right back.

208
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,520
Don't run away.

209
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,560
- Hey, careful, Thian. - Easy does it, Thian.

210
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
TecTien.

211
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,440
So what is it between you and Natheerin?

212
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,440
You know very well how much I like you.

213
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,720
Why care so much about a married woman?

214
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,720
Wouldn't it be better to pay attention to a single one like me?

215
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,400
If you're too drunk,

216
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,600
you can take a rest in my room.

217
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,120
- It's all right. - How can you be all right?

218
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,480
It's okay. Because...

219
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,320
I trust you, Thian.

220
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,160
I trust myself,

221
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,640
but I don't trust you.

222
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,640
Please get out of the way.

223
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,080
Guys, cheers!

224
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,600
Come on, it's like this.

225
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,760
Easy.

226
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,199
- Nott. - Hmm?

227
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,720
You still haven't told us

228
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,439
how and when you became close to Chet.

229
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,520
That's right.

230
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,680
You're being all sweet to him.

231
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
Are you trying to give him hope or something?

232
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,520
What are you talking about?

233
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,240
I'm not being sweet or anything you said.

234
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
I don't like men.

235
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,400
All right? And I'm telling you,

236
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,680
Chet doesn't like me, too. Right, Chet?

237
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,360
Tell them.

238
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,199
Hey, Chet. Why are you quiet?

239
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,080
Just tell them.

240
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,320
- Oh, Thian is back. - Thian!

241
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,240
- What took you so long? - Why did you pour it away?

242
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,160
- Hey, why? - Where did you take a piss?

243
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,800
You went so far for that.

244
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,879
- You playboy. - We finished another bottle while waiting.

245
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,680
Don't you think you took too long?

246
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,959
- So, Thian has come. - Yes.

247
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,759
It's now time for the bedding ceremony.

248
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,280
- That's right. - All right?

249
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,600
- Okay. - Okay?

250
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,720
Okay? Okay? Okay?

251
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,840
Hey, girl.

252
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,160
Oh.

253
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,760
- Kang. - Hey.

254
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,520
Kaofang.

255
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,760
Oh, I'm not dreaming.

256
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,440
You're crying?

257
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,560
Don't tell me Thian turned you down.

258
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,840
- I told you so. - You bastard.

259
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,160
You prick.

260
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
It's all because of you!

261
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,600
- Kang, you brat. - What did I do?

262
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,520
It's because of you. You always hang around with me.

263
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,120
That's why Thian doesn't like me,

264
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,039
because he thinks I'm like you.

265
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,400
Hey! What's wrong with being like me?

266
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,519
What? Tell me.

267
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,720
Well, I don't like women!

268
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,880
Kang!

269
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,240
Hey, do you want one more?

270
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,679
You're melting now, aren't you?

271
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,080
You're enjoying it.

272
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,520
Come on.

273
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,280
Thank you.

274
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,360
You look so cute.

275
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,040
Form a row.

276
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,840
You know, I think

277
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,120
- he doesn't need to wear the bow. - Right.

278
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,560
Even he has it on...

279
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,040
He'll have to take it off anyway.

280
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,079
Hey, Thian. Behave well with Moei.

281
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,519
Don't be such a bully.

282
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,640
- That's right. - Right.

283
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,040
She's this adorable.

284
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,840
- You have to take good care of her. - Yes.

285
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,399
I think we should leave.

286
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,280
We're leaving. Have a good night.

287
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,920
Salute, Master Moei.

288
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,600
Here, I'll close it for you.

289
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,560
Hey, Thian.

290
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,720
Where are you going?

291
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,039
Thian. Are you all right?

292
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,800
They shouldn't have got you so drunk.

293
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,280
Come on. Let's sit down.

294
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,880
I'm not drunk.

295
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,240
How could you not?

296
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,400
You can't even walk straight.

297
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,640
Have some water.

298
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,840
Why are you doing this?

299
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,480
Hmm?

300
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,920
Why are you doing this?

301
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,360
This is a gift from me.

302
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,280
To welcome my groom.

303
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,640
This is a gift from me.

304
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,640
To welcome my groom.

305
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,000
Hey, why did you...

306
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,640
The moon is nice, isn't it?

307
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,400
Moei.

308
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,520
Are you cold, Thian?

309
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,080
Moei.

310
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,600
Look, the moon is so lovely.

311
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
It's really lovely, Thian. Look.

312
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,440
Hmm?

313
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm so sorry.

314
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,560
I've been giving you too much trouble lately.

315
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,280
Since we got married,

316
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,880
we've never been on honeymoon.

317
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,280
That's why I wanted

318
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,840
to bring you here to Myanmar.

319
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,640
Actually, there are more places.

320
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,720
I want to take you.

321
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,280
But we both have been so busy,

322
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,520
so I could only bring you

323
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,040
here.

324
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,320
I'm sorry.

325
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,400
Do you still remember

326
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,680
back when...

327
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,680
you were my peer mentor?

328
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,720
You were in grade 12

329
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,960
and I was in grade 9.

330
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,520
You took me to the home economics room.

331
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,880
Home economics room, right?

332
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,960
You're here.

333
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,840
Thank you.

334
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,040
I also broke your flowerpot

335
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,599
and ran away.

336
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,840
Mom, who's that?

337
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,800
That's Prapha's daughter.

338
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,360
I remember.

339
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,200
I remember you were my peer mentee.

340
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,160
But I didn't know

341
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,320
that my peer mentee

342
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,320
and Mrs. Prapha's daughter

343
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,520
were the same person

344
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,960
until...

345
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,679
Today's my most exciting day ever.

346
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,719
I learned that the senior class president,

347
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,960
the guy who's my love at first sight

348
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,520
is Thian.

349
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,200
And he's also my peer mentor.

350
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,360
What is this called? A destiny?

351
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,280
But I wasn't sure about that.

352
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,040
So, when we visited Phuket,

353
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,120
I went to our school.

354
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
(Natheerin Sawadhirat)

355
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,280
My peer mentee

356
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,320
was really Moei.

357
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,800
On that day, I waited to meet you.

358
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,280
The day they revealed the names.

359
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,200
But you didn't show up.

360
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,040
Well, I thought...

361
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,520
you wouldn't like me.

362
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,200
But then you liked me?

363
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,560
Do women these days

364
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
initiate things now?

365
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,200
Of course.

366
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,760
Why is that?

367
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,360
Well...

368
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,320
I don't want anyone else to have you.

369
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,560
I wish I could be with you like this for a long time.

370
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,720
I don't want tomorrow to come.

371
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,720
Are you cold, Thian?

372
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,080
Look, Thian.

373
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,320
This is a gift from me.

374
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,400
To welcome my groom.

375
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,200
You look so cute.

376
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,840
If you can translate it correctly within today

377
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,200
by 6 pm, then you can have the certificate.

378
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,040
(Divorce Application)

379
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,880
I don't have any more time.

380
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,840
Let's take a photo together.

381
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,960
Why bother?

382
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,040
I see you every day.

383
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,160
But we have no photo together.

384
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,360
I've known you since I was young.

385
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,880
But we have never taken a photo together.

386
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,000
Can I have just one photo as a souvenir?

387
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,760
- Everywhere. - Okay.

388
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,560
Hold on.

389
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,240
Tell me. Where is Moei now?

390
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,760
She's your wife.

391
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,680
If you don't know, how would I?

392
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,280
I'll forget you.

393
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,840
I promise.

394
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,920
May he not be so harsh to me.

395
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,120
May he love me for a long time.

396
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,520
Just kidding.

397
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,400
At the pagoda,

398
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,400
what did you wish for?

399
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,520
I don't know who I've been waiting for

400
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,120
and how much longer I have to wait,

401
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,040
but I know that I have to.

402
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,600
If the holy spirits here do exist,

403
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,320
please let me meet that person

404
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,000
who will not look only at my appearance

405
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,080
or at my status,

406
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,480
but will be ready to go through good and bad times with me,

407
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,960
no matter how rich or poor I will be.

408
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,400
And if one day I meet that person,

409
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,400
please let me fall in love with her immediately,

410
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,080
because I've also spent my whole life

411
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,480
seeking

412
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,680
for someone who is everything I've been waiting for.

413
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,920
Moei!

414
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,400
Moei!

415
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,800
Why are you going back?

416
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,440
Are you getting out or not?

417
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,400
Since you've been in love with me for half of your life,

418
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,600
but now, you're trying to climb out of my pit of love,

419
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,320
I'll put you back to where you belong,

420
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,760
bury you down there completely,

421
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,120
pour the concrete over, and top it up with steel wool,

422
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,360
so you won't change the way you feel about me, in this life

423
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,240
and the one after.

424
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,360
I won't get out. Don't get out.

425
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,120
I won't look at him. Don't look at him.

426
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,080
Moei, let's go back to the base camp.

427
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,160
Thian.

428
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,800
Was the moon last night not lovely enough?

429
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,440
We haven't been married for long,

430
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,200
and you're running away already?

431
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,720
Last night,

432
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,440
it was...

433
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,800
it was just a prank.

434
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,640
We were not really doing the bedding ceremony.

435
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,960
That was a prank?

436
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,520
Then who was it

437
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,400
that said she didn't want anyone else to have me?

438
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,720
Where were you going?

439
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,560
Why didn't you tell me first?

440
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,680
I didn't see you when I woke up.

441
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,920
I was so scared, you know?

442
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,280
Have you ever thought

443
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,800
how I would be

444
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,840
if you ran away?

445
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,760
You may want to know

446
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,280
why I didn't let you go.

447
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,960
It's because the report you submitted

448
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,360
need to be fix.

449
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,920
Since you ditched your work

450
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,400
without my permission,

451
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,600
your report workload will get doubled.

452
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,600
You are such an irresponsible assistant.

453
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,720
And don't even try to run away again.

454
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,840
If I catch you,

455
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,560
the workload will keep doubling.

456
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,840
Keep that in mind.

457
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,680
Attention, all camp guards.

458
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,400
From now on, never let Natheerin leave the base camp,

459
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,040
if I, Thiarawat, don't allow it.

460
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,320
Go sleep on the bed.

461
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,400
You didn't get any sleep, did you?

462
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,120
Since you dared ask me,

463
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,240
I'll give what you asked for.

464
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,800
If you don't want anyone else to have me,

465
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,080
I will only be yours.

466
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,520
That serves him right.

467
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,120
Ri told me everyone at the site was saying.

468
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,000
Thian went running after Moei.

469
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,639
Sajee, you should tell him. I feel bad for him.

470
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,800
You don't have to feel bad for him.

471
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,360
He needs to suffer even more than this.

472
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,920
Prapha, let's bet.

473
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,400
From now on,

474
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,040
things will get even more fun.

475
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,480
Wait and see.

476
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,000
This is so funny.

477
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,080
What is funny?

478
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,280
Didn't you say you didn't want to be close to Moei?

479
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,640
Why did you run after and bring her back?

480
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,280
We are short-handed.

481
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,520
Is that all?

482
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,480
You know,

483
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,479
Mom and Aunt Pha were super worried

484
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,800
that Moei didn't get home.

485
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,040
You should call and tell Aunt Pha your reason.

486
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,200
Tell Mom, too. They're waiting.

487
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,599
I'll give you three months then you can get divorced.

488
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,640
What?

489
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,439
Really?

490
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,880
You'll let me divorce Moei?

491
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,120
I'm serious.

492
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,080
But you have to pay her 10 million in alimony.

493
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
Now, I get it. Moei was going back.

494
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,080
- Mom was planning to take her somewhere? - Why?

495
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,960
Since Moei doesn't have to act as your wife anymore.

496
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,440
Isn't that good? Mom wants her to live a normal life.

497
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,360
And you'll also go back to your normal life.

498
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
As you always wished. Isn't that good?

499
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,360
Jeez, Mom.

500
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,440
Thian, could it be...

501
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,680
you have changed your mind?

502
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,840
That's why you don't want to let her go.

503
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,760
Nonsense.

504
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,640
Tell Mom that she can't go anywhere

505
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,400
unless she finishes her work.

506
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,040
And if she has a problem, she can call me.

507
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,520
But now, I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

508
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,000
I've had enough.

509
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,720
"I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed."

510
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,480
Jeez, you're acting all cool.

511
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,840
Hi, Mom.

512
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,800
Mom, it's your son.

513
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,480
He said he won't let Moei go

514
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,200
unless her work is done.

515
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,600
Gosh, I really want to shoot him to Mars.

516
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,720
Mom, your son is so tight-lipped, you know?

517
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,560
Let him be.

518
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,400
Right now, he won't dare call me.

519
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,040
But you have to keep me posted.

520
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,120
Got it?

521
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,479
Copy that, Madam.

522
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,680
Okay, I'm hanging up.

523
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,200
What about your promise to give Moei freedom?

524
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,800
I don't know what made Thian to change his mind.

525
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,280
But Moei has chosen her path.

526
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,080
Eventually, Thian will have to let her go.

527
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,520
Thian!

528
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,320
I get it you don't want me to ditch my work.

529
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,760
But why do I have to stay with you?

530
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,560
Aren't you afraid people might misunderstand?

531
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,080
- Thian. - Hey.

532
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,400
Hey, don't disturb me now.

533
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,320
Look, the sun is about to set.

534
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,080
It's pretty, isn't it?

535
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,760
- Gosh, Thian! - Get back to work.

536
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,800
Or I'll tell Mom that you got me drunk

537
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,960
and tried to do awful things in my room.

538
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,800
You're so cruel.

539
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,360
You're so mean, so bossy, so irrational.

540
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,160
What did you say?

541
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,920
You're so cruel. Loud and clear?

542
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,240
I had to put up with your meanness for years.

543
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,800
I won't let you do it anymore.

544
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,360
I'll move to Tum's room.

545
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,920
Do you think there will be a room for you there?

546
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,920
I just moved out this morning. How can someone take my place?

547
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,159
We're pretty packed these days

548
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,880
since we hire more workers.

549
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,720
I don't think your chance to stay with Tum is gone.

550
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,120
You know why?

551
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,600
I have moved the tents of Hammoc team

552
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,080
somewhere else.

553
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,400
Oh, beautiful sea.

554
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,680
Bright blue sky. Look.

555
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,040
I see a sailboat.

556
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,320
Sailing in the sea.

557
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,480
I see crabs on the beautiful sand.

558
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,840
Colorful fish are everywhere.

559
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,240
All the shrimp and all the clams.

560
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,680
Are in the...

561
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,280
- Sea! - Sea.

562
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,880
My only way out

563
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,040
is to run away from him.

564
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,080
Oh, Thian.

565
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,440
Thian, I'm hungry.

566
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,680
I suddenly got a stomachache.

567
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,680
What do you want to eat?

568
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,840
What?

569
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,600
Well, anything.

570
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,840
As long as I get to eat.

571
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,320
It hurts so much.

572
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,480
This is easier than I thought.

573
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,040
- Mingalaba. - Mingalaba.

574
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,520
Mingalaba.

575
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,840
Mingalaba.

576
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,840
Hey, Thian!

577
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,120
Thian. Hey, man. So...

578
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,800
How was that night?

579
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,040
Have you officially slept with her?

580
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,520
- What? - What?

581
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,080
That's a shame, man.

582
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,919
You don't live up to the playboy title.

583
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,800
So, what are you trying to do?

584
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,560
Are you planning to stop her from going home

585
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,640
and keep her by your side?

586
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,280
Why so quiet? Not a word at all?

587
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,520
Hey, what's that? There are two boxes.

588
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,360
- Hey, that's food. - What about us?

589
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,079
- He wants doubles. - Just five boxes will do.

590
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,720
Who is the other box for?

591
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,600
- Definitely not for us. - I gotta go.

592
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,040
What's the rush, man?

593
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,959
Just stay and talk for a couple of hours.

594
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,560
I need to work on the reports. I'm running out of time.

595
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,520
You haven't finished them? It's been three days.

596
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,640
Are you deaf?

597
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,520
I said I have reports to finish.

598
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,920
That's enough! Move!

599
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,800
It must have stressed him out.

600
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,840
That's why he got himself two boxes.

601
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,080
Moei, your food is here. Open the door.

602
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,560
I won't.

603
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,920
Moei, please open the door for me.

604
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,520
Thian, let's make a deal.

605
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,920
What deal?

606
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,840
If you let me go,

607
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,320
I'll ask Mr. Baramee

608
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,840
to send you to Hong Kong as initially planned.

609
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,360
You won't last here, trust me.

610
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,920
You've never gone through hardship.

611
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,040
And besides,

612
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,760
if people know we're staying together,

613
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,480
your reputation will be ruined

614
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,520
because everyone knows I'm married.

615
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,160
They might accuse us of committing adultery.

616
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,640
Can you commit adultery with your own husband?

617
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,400
Look.

618
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,760
Mom is giving out the wedding cards soon,

619
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,600
Why scared they would know?

620
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,640
Can you not make light of this?

621
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,160
I know you'll never do what Aunt Jee said.

622
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,400
Hey, Thian.

623
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,280
If you keep me here,

624
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,560
you'll never get to go to Hong Kong.

625
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,720
Thian.

626
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,720
Okay, I'm sorry

627
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,480
for teasing you too much these days.

628
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,400
But if you keep me like this,

629
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
you'll only get yourself into trouble.

630
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,000
And as I told you,

631
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,720
I was the one who made you here,

632
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,960
so I'm the only one

633
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,640
who can take you back.

634
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,160
You'd better understand that.

635
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,560
That's an interesting offer,

636
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,200
but what if I don't take it?

637
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,880
Fine, if you don't take the offer,

638
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,640
then find somewhere else to stay,

639
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,080
because I'll stay in this room.

640
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,200
Thank you.

641
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,320
Moei, open it.

642
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,760
You can stop trying.

643
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,400
I won't open it for you.

644
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,240
Moei. Hey.

645
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,560
Come back and open the door.

646
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,200
Monthly progress report.

647
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,039
Dug holes for ground columns.

648
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,959
Poured concrete and installed columns.

649
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,119
Installed supporting base and septic tank.

650
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,560
Beam and floor installation. Completed.

651
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,280
Molded truss, 60% completed in advance.

652
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,880
In summary, the progress meets 120% of the target.

653
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,240
Signature, please.

654
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,320
Thank you.

655
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,360
- Chet. - Hmm?

656
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,240
Jeez, Thian is good.

657
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,160
Before he came, we didn't even reach 80% of progress,

658
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,600
Now look at it, it went up to 120%.

659
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,920
Thank you.

660
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,080
- Tum. - What is it?

661
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,600
I don't get it.

662
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,840
Why doesn't Thian want to move to Hong Kong.

663
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,520
Hey, are you crazy?

664
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,920
You get to be with him now. Don't you like that?

665
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,200
Are you getting a little wacky?

666
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,720
It's time to stop being delusional.

667
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,320
You know very well he doesn't love me.

668
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,400
And now, being close to him

669
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,720
makes it more difficult for me to get over him.

670
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,200
Yes, I get your point.

671
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,960
You're right. It's kind of weird.

672
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,679
Why doesn't he want to go to Hong Kong?

673
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,919
Right?

674
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,079
I don't see him pay attention to anything else

675
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,080
other than the progress of the project.

676
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,280
You see, since he arrived,

677
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,760
the project has made so much progress.

678
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,000
Yes, that's true.

679
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,400
Since he arrived,

680
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,520
he seems to have more power, too.

681
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,839
Most importantly,

682
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,480
the senior architects seem to feel very obligated to him.

683
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,840
- Yes. - Don't you think so?

684
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,880
Yes.

685
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,600
But no matter how much power he has,

686
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,560
he won't be able to beat Natheerin,

687
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,719
Mr. Baramee's favorite person, right?

688
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,880
Right?

689
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,040
Hey, my hat is coming off.

690
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,320
Hey, Moei.

691
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,840
- What is it? - If you want him to go to Hong Kong,

692
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,400
why don't you submit a request?

693
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,720
When you sent him over here to Dawei,

694
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,799
you didn't ask for his consent, did you?

695
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,079
It's actually quite simple.

696
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,320
Go ahead and submit the request.

697
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,680
Chet!

698
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,800
Wait up.

699
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,240
Chet.

700
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,440
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

701
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,840
Congratulations in advance on your move to Hong Kong, Thian.

702
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,280
- What? Hong Kong? - He's going to Hong Kong?

703
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,439
Yes.

704
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,560
Damn it. Thian.

705
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,480
You bastard.

706
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,119
You evil friend. How could you do this?

707
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,640
You dragged us here to suffer.

708
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,000
Now you're going to Hong Kong to enjoy your life?

709
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,720
Jeez, should I just slap you?

710
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,760
I'd rather you stamped on my face than do this to me.

711
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,680
Just stab us with a knife.

712
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,920
Hold on.

713
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,400
- Who said I'm going? - What?

714
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,120
I said so.

715
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,640
Don't forget

716
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,560
you came to Dawei because I asked Mr. Baramee to send you.

717
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,479
This time, if I want to send you to Hong Kong,

718
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,840
it won't be difficult.

719
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,200
You have no right to send me as you please.

720
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,400
Chet will probably announce your move in the meeting today.

721
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,600
Good luck, Thian.

722
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,040
It's time for the meeting.

723
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,400
Let's go. After you.

724
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,200
Is he really going?

725
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,480
Hello. It's my pleasure to work with you.

726
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,120
It's an honor to get to work with you.

727
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,160
Why is everyone getting so thrilled?

728
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,080
It's a pleasure to work with you.

729
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,640
Thank you.

730
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,400
Please take a seat.

731
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,880
Since the board

732
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,360
has commented on the delay in the third phase,

733
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,040
now we need to speed up the process.

734
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,120
I would like to thank you all

735
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,560
for sacrificing and moving here.

736
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,880
First of all, let's take a look at the progress of the project

737
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,399
and the problems that we've encountered

738
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,200
throughout the process.

739
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,479
My plan in sending Thian over to Hong Kong must have been successful.

740
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,880
Now that your scope of work and timeframes are all clear,

741
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,760
if you manage your work well,

742
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,680
I believe this project will be carried out smoothly

743
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,680
and will be completed on time.

744
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,880
All right, thank you for today, everyone.

745
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,360
Mr. Baramee made the right decision assigning this project to you.

746
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,800
The company intended to have me manage this project from start,

747
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,600
so I can't let everyone down.

748
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,760
The company intended to send him from start?

749
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,200
I thought you were going to Hong Kong.

750
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,000
Why were you sent here all of a sudden?

751
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,000
I was happy to come to Dawei.

752
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,800
I wasn't forced

753
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,440
like some people think.

754
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,760
So I'll stay here with you all.

755
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,840
I'm not going anywhere.

756
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,520
That's awesome.

757
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,040
- That's good to hear. - Chet.

758
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,520
Chet.

759
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,720
- Chet. - Hmm? Yes?

760
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,360
So the company assigned him here from the start?

761
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,120
not because I made him to?

762
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,920
Well, yes.

763
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,520
As Thian said,

764
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,760
this project was delayed right from the start,

765
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,520
so they sent him over

766
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,000
to crash the project.

767
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,120
Chet.

768
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,640
Why didn't you tell me?

769
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,000
Thian told me he would tell you himself.

770
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,000
He didn't want to come at first, did he?

771
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,080
That's also true.

772
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:04,120
Thian asked his mom to buy all the shares Mr. Thada had withdrawn.

773
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,120
So right now,

774
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,760
he's the son of the major shareholder of the company.

775
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,680
He has the power to be at whichever site he wants,

776
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,600
or come and go as he pleases.

777
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,120
No one can force him.

778
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,120
The son of the shareholder?

779
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,000
He could proceed with work right after he arrived,

780
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,200
because everything had been planned out from the start.

781
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,800
What makes you so mad at me?

782
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,280
- What did I... - Stop it.

783
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,280
You asked Mr. Baramee to send me here, right?

784
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,800
What makes you think you could escape me?

785
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,880
You seem to have the nerve to try me.

786
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,840
If this is how you want to play,

787
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,920
you'd better watch your back.

788
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,160
Have I been played by him all along?

789
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,000
Why are you going to Dawei?

790
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,320
Didn't you say the project in Hong Kong

791
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,720
was your dream project?

792
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,160
It is.

793
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,800
But I'm also responsible for Moei's safety,

794
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,120
as it's me who sent her to meet Mr. Thada and Pondej.

795
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,559
And now Pondej knows her,

796
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,840
he could harm her anytime.

797
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,360
Does she know you're going to Dawei?

798
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,240
Not yet,

799
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,240
but please keep this from her for now.

800
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,000
When the right time comes,

801
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:08,800
I will tell her myself.

802
01:10:22,936 --> 01:10:24,280
What's going on over there?

803
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,240
Can someone poke her to see if she's dead?

804
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,680
Thian.

805
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,880
You can now get back to work. Thanks for coming today.

806
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,600
Natheerin.

807
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,240
Where are you going?

808
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,120
Well, I'm getting back to work.

809
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,680
I'm still here.

810
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,600
Well...

811
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,320
I'll wait for you outside.

812
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,760
Oh, my.

813
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,600
Finally it's over. No more secrets now.

814
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,560
I'm so relieved!

815
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,560
Will you stay here for long?

816
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,440
I don't think so.

817
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,839
I think once the project falls into place,

818
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,560
I'll find someone to replace me.

819
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,080
I'm sick of being watched here.

820
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,000
What about you?

821
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,200
Well, I'll probably stay here for another two months.

822
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,480
Do you think being married is better than single?

823
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,560
Are you interested in someone?

824
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,800
Well, I'm still thinking.

825
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,640
Thian, this is something serious.

826
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,240
You have to take care

827
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,560
and take responsibility for another person's life all your life.

828
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,960
Is it that hard?

829
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,960
You have to protect her with all your might.

830
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,000
Look, a family

831
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,719
is the one thing that will be with you your whole life.

832
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,720
Got it?

833
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,000
You and Mon must love each other so much.

834
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,600
If you love someone as much as your own life,

835
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,480
then you understand.

836
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,560
You're lucky to have met Mon.

837
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,520
You're also lucky.

838
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,400
What do you think about Moei?

839
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,520
And what about you?

840
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,640
Well...

841
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,040
she's cute.

842
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,520
What?

843
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,960
He wants to marry Moei for real?

844
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,360
Mom, don't let me confirm this.

845
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,120
I think you better hear it from him.

846
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:04,480
Hey, don't get me curious and leave me just like that.

847
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,680
You know how much I want these two to end up together.

848
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,680
I have lost counts of times I had my hopes up and got disappointed.

849
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,240
Are you sure you didn't just hear things?

850
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,000
He asked me about marriage.

851
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,080
He also asked me

852
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,640
what I think about Moei.

853
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,160
What would you think?

854
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,080
I'm happy of course.

855
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,520
Right, Mom? I told you.

856
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,880
- Is everyone here? - Yes.

857
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,040
Okay.

858
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,560
You can go to work.

859
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,920
Here.

860
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,760
Right.

861
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,440
Thank you.

862
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,080
Aren't your neck sore looking down?

863
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,680
It could be worse if it's sprained.

864
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,720
Come on, keep your head up, Ms. Loser.

865
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,760
Mom-to-be of Mite and Louse's.

866
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,560
Are you about to pass out?

867
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,400
I've got an inhaler. Want some?

868
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,160
Do I look like a ghost or what?

869
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,840
Why can't you meet my eyes?

870
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,120
It's nothing.

871
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,960
It just looks tiring.

872
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,920
It's so fun teasing you.

873
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,720
I might be too harsh about the report.

874
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,600
But that way I can keep you under control.

875
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,200
Experience has taught me

876
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,480
never let your brain relax.

877
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,480
Or you may think of ways to get away from me.

878
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,680
Please hang in there for a while.

879
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,600
Once we get married,

880
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,480
I won't let you get tired like this anymore.

881
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,200
- Hey, he's over there. - Chet.

882
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,199
- Chet. - What's it?

883
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,720
- Chet. - Hey, wait.

884
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,360
- Hey. - Come here. Let's talk.

885
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,320
- Wait. What's this? - Is Thian here?

886
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,160
- No, he's not. - I heard you'll send Thian to Hong Kong.

887
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,280
Right.

888
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,880
Did you hear this from Moei?

889
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,560
He's not going anywhere.

890
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,400
What? Are you serious?

891
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,559
Chet, thank you so much.

892
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,359
- He's not going anymore. - This is awesome.

893
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,919
I thought he would ditch us again.

894
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,840
- Man, I'm happy. - You bet!

895
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,120
Wait. Didn't he tell you anything?

896
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,720
He shouldn't keep something this important a secret from you.

897
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,640
Something important? Secret?

898
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,400
Does he have a secret again?

899
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,840
- Exactly. - What secret is it again this time?

900
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,200
What is it, Chet?

901
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,400
What is it?

902
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,440
Hello, Mr. Son of the New Shareholder.

903
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,839
Aren't you going to check the site, Sir?

904
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,400
Guys, roll out the carpet for him right now.

905
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,000
- Don't let dirt taint his feet. - There is no need for that.

906
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,680
Come on. Wipe it.

907
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,080
- Sir, please. - Nott.

908
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,480
So, are we going to get

909
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,400
a six-month bonus this year, sir?

910
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,680
Can you not bring that up?

911
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,000
- I'm broke these days. - What the heck?

912
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,759
Hey, hold on. What are you talking about?

913
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,440
You're the new shareholder.

914
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,560
How can you be poor?

915
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,839
You can check my bank account. It's empty.

916
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,119
And my last sum of money, that Spending Star gave away at merit-making.

917
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:42,040
Oh, what a desperate life with a wife ripping him off.

918
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,480
Yeah, I also owe her 10 million baht.

919
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,159
I don't know where to get that from.

920
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,360
Ten million? Who do you owe that to?

921
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,080
If I don't marry Moei,

922
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,320
I'll have to pay her 10 million in alimony.

923
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,080
Hey, why make things complicated?

924
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,680
You can simply get married.

925
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,159
It's difficult to earn money,

926
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,920
but it's easy to sacrifice your body, you know.

927
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,840
Gosh, let me give you a slap.

928
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,320
- Why did you slap me? - How could you teach him that?

929
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,759
You're a man.

930
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,720
You should be proud of your dignity.

931
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,160
- You can't sell yourself. - Right.

932
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,559
You have to preserve your virginity for Moei

933
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,520
until your wedding night. Got it?

934
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,680
I'd rather sacrifice my body.

935
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,080
Where would I get 10 million baht?

936
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,600
You're such a pimp.

937
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,880
And not just a normal pimp.

938
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,080
You're a pimp with a dotted shirt and bangs.

939
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,480
You terrible creature!

940
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,999
Thian won't do such a thing.

941
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,240
Right, Thian?

942
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,880
But that's not a bad idea.

943
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,920
Did you hear that?

944
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,560
A gentleman's pride can be bought these days.

945
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,839
And for someone like Thian,

946
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,640
he would only sacrifice his body

947
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,240
for over an 8-figure debt.

948
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,680
Anyway, since you don't have to pay the 8-figure debt,

949
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,639
be grateful for her kindness, all right?

950
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,359
Appreciate everything she's done.

951
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,760
Don't be ungrateful and cause her trouble.

952
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,519
Learn to reciprocate her kindness.

953
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,560
Give her a girl and a boy to cheer her up. Got it?

954
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,839
I get it. Go, get back to work now. I got it.

955
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,840
Think carefully, your body in exchange for an 8-figure.

956
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,120
- That's it? It's over? - Let's go.

957
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,360
What the hell?

958
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,160
Think it over carefully, Thian.

959
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,720
What?

960
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,600
He wants to get married to clear his debt?

961
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,280
I have to get out of this

962
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,280
before he uses his body to pay off his debt.

963
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,080
Mite and Louse, please don't come yet.

964
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,440
Let me find you a kinder father, okay?

965
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,920
Hello, Moei. How are you doing?

966
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,520
I was about to call you.

967
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,200
What?

968
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,440
What did he do again?

969
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,040
Thian, we're in trouble.

970
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:27,040
The metal supplier has delayed delivery again.

971
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,720
Please tell them

972
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,560
all system task materials arrived long ago,

973
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,520
but we can't proceed to mold the columns because of them.

974
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,600
If they can't meet the agreement,

975
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,040
I'll propose a change of supplier in the meeting.

976
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,120
Go.

977
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,480
Okay.

978
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,320
Mr. Thian, could you please take a look over here?

979
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,080
- Why is it like this? - What is it?

980
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,320
Please have a look.

981
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,000
Okay, I'll take it from here.

982
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,240
Thank you.

983
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,680
Everyone, listen.

984
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,520
I can't let this project get any more delayed.

985
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,960
The executives are coming over in a few days for an inspection.

986
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,320
Everything has to go according as planned.

987
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,080
Understand?

988
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,880
Yes, Mom.

989
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,800
What are you planning to do to Moei?

990
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,240
You're such a bully.

991
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,279
Who taught you to do something like this?

992
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,679
Or did I get my child switched up at the hospital?

993
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,560
How come you didn't inherit my kindness at all?

994
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,400
Tell me what you're trying to do.

995
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,560
What are your wishes all this time?

996
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,840
Don't you want me to end up with your beloved girl?

997
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,360
I'm doing that for you now.

998
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,560
You're planning to marry Moei to clear your debt, aren't you?

999
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,920
Don't lie to me.

1000
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,840
Mom, my friends and I were just joking.

1001
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,479
She made that assumption herself.

1002
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,159
You're planning to sleep with her then dump her, aren't you?

1003
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,800
You're going to treat her like all your girls, aren't you?

1004
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,560
Don't ever think I don't know you,

1005
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,640
you evil brat.

1006
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,560
If I had known you would grow up this way,

1007
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,799
I would've have let you make through day one.

1008
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,880
Listen, Mom.

1009
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,920
That was before. I won't do that now.

1010
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,520
And one more thing, listen carefully,

1011
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,360
Moei was the one who ran away from me first.

1012
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,960
If I didn't stop her, she would be in Thailand now.

1013
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,840
And you wouldn't get to have your grandchild.

1014
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,040
Thian, are you serious about this?

1015
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,720
So why is Moei so scared of you?

1016
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,680
You're picking on her, aren't you?

1017
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,840
Tell me now, you rascal.

1018
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,200
Mom, if you want a grandchild.,

1019
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,840
you must leave everything to me.

1020
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,640
You only need to find an auspicious time.

1021
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,880
And in two months,

1022
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,520
I'll take Moei back to Phuket for our wedding.

1023
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,760
Okay.

1024
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,240
I wonder if Aunt Jee got Thian disciplined.

1025
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,320
Hello, Moei. What is it?

1026
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,280
Aunt Jee, how did it go?

1027
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,560
What did you say?

1028
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,799
I can't really hear you.

1029
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,280
The signal is not so good.

1030
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,440
Moei.

1031
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,920
Moei.

1032
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,520
Hello?

1033
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,880
Aunt Jee.

1034
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,600
Aunt Jee, can you hear me? Hello?

1035
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,440
Hello?

1036
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,360
The signal... Hello?

1037
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,760
Aunt Jee, can you hear me?

1038
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:06,999
Can you hear me?

1039
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,360
The signal is not good.

1040
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,360
Aunt Jee.

1041
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,720
What the heck?

1042
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,839
- Oh, Prapha. - I'm delivering the desserts.

1043
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,120
I see. Come and get the desserts.

1044
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,040
Let's take a seat.

1045
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,840
Moei is calling me.

1046
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,200
Don't take it.

1047
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,639
Why?

1048
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,320
It might be something urgent.

1049
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,920
Don't take it. Not now.

1050
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,680
Mom won't answer either.

1051
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,080
- She hung up. - She did?

1052
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,120
Come on. Let's take a seat.

1053
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,360
Madam.

1054
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,600
Moei is calling me.

1055
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,080
- Don't take it. Don't. - Okay.

1056
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,800
Let's have a meeting. It's urgent. Come on.

1057
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,480
Why won't anyone pick up?

1058
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,160
Kaofang.

1059
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,440
Didn't you say TecTien was yours?

1060
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,200
Why did you let someone else snatch him away?

1061
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,560
Who? Who snatched him away?

1062
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,880
Where have you been?

1063
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,520
How could you miss this?

1064
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,440
It's Natheerin.

1065
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,400
They're totally inseparable.

1066
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:48,480
People even say she walks out of Thian's room in the mornings.

1067
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,520
You should look into this

1068
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,720
and see what's going on between them.

1069
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,960
Is TecTien really having an affair with a married woman?

1070
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,160
I'm back!

1071
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,000
Hey, you wacko.

1072
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:21,160
You never told me if you'd move in or out.

1073
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,520
And you disappeared after that night.

1074
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,720
I didn't do anything weird that night, did I?

1075
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,880
What are you talking about?

1076
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,600
Nothing happened at all.

1077
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,600
Well, you see,

1078
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:40,400
I disappeared to think things over.

1079
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,120
I think we should make peace.

1080
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,400
- What? - Yeah.

1081
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,880
Are you being serious?

1082
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,320
Are you the real Kaofang?

1083
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,599
- Are you possessed? - Wait.

1084
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,200
Hey, this is Kaofang in a flesh.

1085
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:00,720
Why do you suddenly want to make peace with me?

1086
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,960
It's so not like you.

1087
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,480
Well, you made me realize

1088
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,960
that I should stop running after Thian.

1089
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,880
What?

1090
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,360
Are you for real?

1091
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,920
Yes.

1092
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,080
Thank you so much, Kang.

1093
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,640
Let's be friends.

1094
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:26,240
Of course.

1095
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,800
Why would you want to be friends with me?

1096
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,840
Fine, let's be friends.

1097
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,800
Hey, Kang.

1098
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,040
I got the approval.

1099
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,080
I'll leave the juniors to you now.

1100
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,400
Kob, are you really leaving?

1101
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,640
Hey, don't pretend to be sad.

1102
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,520
I know you're happy to be promoted to my position.

1103
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,560
You're really... Wanna get your mouth cracked saying such thing?

1104
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,840
Who would be happy?

1105
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,279
It's way more tiring working in your job.

1106
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,360
You bastard.

1107
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,040
Come on, Kang.

1108
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,920
I know you can do it.

1109
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,800
I believe in you.

1110
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,680
You nerve-wrecking brat.

1111
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,040
Hey, Kob. Have you told Moei about this?

1112
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,400
Are you really going back to Thailand?

1113
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,880
Yes.

1114
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,720
Take good care of yourself after I leave, okay?

1115
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,880
Why is it so sudden?

1116
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,920
Well...

1117
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,479
there are things that need to be dealt with there.

1118
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,880
So they called me back.

1119
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,120
Okay.

1120
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,400
Well then,

1121
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,080
I'd like to thank you

1122
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,160
for always helping me.

1123
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,680
And I'd also like to apologize

1124
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,600
for all the troubles I have caused you.

1125
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:36,840
You silly girl.

1126
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,680
Don't talk like we won't meet again.

1127
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,000
It's true I'm leaving here,

1128
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,239
But I'll always be by your side.

1129
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,519
If there's anything you want me to help you with,

1130
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,560
just tell me anytime.

1131
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,760
All right?

1132
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,160
Thank you so much, Kob.

1133
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,240
I appreciate that.

1134
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:06,000
Before I leave,

1135
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,280
is there anything you want me to help with?

1136
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,440
Is there?

1137
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,960
How will I finish this before the wedding?

1138
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,760
I should be going back now.

1139
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,480
If there was anything unusual,

1140
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,800
the guard will probably inform me.

1141
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,920
An organ that starts with the letter H. Start!

1142
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,279
Come on! Go, go.

1143
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,839
- Heart. - Yes.

1144
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,840
Come on.

1145
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,800
Come on! Go, go, go.

1146
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,640
- The letter H! - Four!

1147
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:01,680
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Letter H, right?

1148
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,560
- Come on! - The letter H!

1149
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,280
Hey, TecTien.

1150
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:06,840
Wait up.

1151
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,120
A rematch maybe?

1152
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,720
No, I'm tired.

1153
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,640
You fear you might lose again, right?

1154
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,320
All right, I get it.

1155
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,520
Hey, guys, he's such an amateur.

1156
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,320
Oh, you're accepting the challenge?

1157
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,520
What's the rush?

1158
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,680
- Where are you going? - Move.

1159
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,760
Hang on.

1160
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,280
Calm down, my friend. Look.

1161
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,520
We have an offer for you.

1162
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,560
If you win, we'll let Moei stay with you.

1163
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,840
But if you lose,

1164
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,960
you'll have to return Moei to us.

1165
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,400
Right, guys?

1166
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:54,760
- Yes! - Yes!

1167
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,120
But all houses are occupied.

1168
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,720
Oh, that's not a problem.

1169
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,080
You only need to agree to it.

1170
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,360
As for the house, I'll sacrifice ours for Moei.

1171
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,359
- Right, guys? - Yes.

1172
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,760
- Right, guys? - Yes.

1173
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:06,920
So?

1174
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,920
Deal.

1175
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,600
Wow, you're the man.

1176
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,880
Deal!

1177
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:18,760
Deal!

1178
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,680
Well, how many should we score this time?

1179
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,000
I'm saved now.

1180
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:05,280
I'm sorry.

1181
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,160
Moei.

1182
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,000
This is all we could help you with.

1183
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,000
Kob, Kang,

1184
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,520
I'm really sorry.

1185
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,560
Moei, you don't have to apologize.

1186
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,040
Moei.

1187
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,360
Moei.

1188
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:32,960
Here.

1189
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:37,880
Take it.

1190
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,600
Well, how many should we score this time?

1191
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,440
Help me hand this out.

1192
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,240
I'm sorry.

1193
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:08,320
I'm sorry.

1194
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,760
I'm sorry.

1195
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:20,720
Today, we have a special show

1196
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:23,640
for you to enjoy all day long.

1197
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:25,159
Without further ado,

1198
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:28,000
please give a round of applause

1199
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,360
to the Jar Dance.

1200
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,520
Please, come on out.

1201
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,559
Come on. Don't be shy.

1202
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,280
But this is so embarrassing, Toon.

1203
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,440
I know. But they have to deal with it.

1204
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,880
Do you want to see their faces now?

1205
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,320
I really can't wait.

1206
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,360
Let's welcome them onstage then.

1207
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,760
- Come on. - Come here.

1208
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,680
Let's see who we have here.

1209
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,280
Wow, wow.

1210
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:58,000
- Hey, is that her? - Are you at the wrong event, girl?

1211
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,960
- Are you at the wrong event? - Can you look up?

1212
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,240
It's really her in a flesh.

1213
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,720
Hey, guys. Give them a round of laughter.

1214
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,119
How come they agreed to do all this?

1215
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,359
It's a punishment for the losers who were completely crushed by TPC

1216
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,800
with the score of 6-2.

1217
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,720
- I would never agree to this. - Me neither.

1218
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,280
Are you guys having fun?

1219
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,400
It's so much fun.

1220
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,280
Our dancers are performing so well.

1221
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,720
We would like to thank our main sponsor,

1222
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:10,879
Tanaka Powder,

1223
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,960
- the powder that makes our faces bright, - Just like this.

1224
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,400
beautiful and bright.

1225
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,080
Not just ordinary bright,

1226
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:19,600
but super bright all day.

1227
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,320
- Where are you going? - What are you doing, Thian?

1228
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,320
Where are you going?

1229
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,920
I'm leaving. I don't think that is funny.

1230
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,040
You can't.

1231
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,840
I told you. You have to always stick to me.

1232
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,320
This is a punishment

1233
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:39,600
for asking Hammoc for help.

1234
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,040
Can you stop forcing me?

1235
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:45,640
You can't keep me with you forever.

1236
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,160
You think I can't?

1237
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:51,680
On September 19th and 24th,

1238
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:56,480
TecTien will no longer be a bachelor!

1239
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:08,280
The wedding will be held both in Phuket and Bangkok.

1240
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,960
No longer a bachelor?

1241
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,520
Is he getting married?

1242
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,200
You asked my mom for help.

1243
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,440
Do you think you can run away from me?

1244
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,640
What is it?

1245
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,120
Give me your phone.

1246
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,400
I'm not giving it to you.

1247
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,880
What if my mom calls me?

1248
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:35,560
I'll take it and you can call her back.

1249
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,360
She won't have to pay for the call.

1250
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,400
I won't give it to you.

1251
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,600
- Give it to me. - No.

1252
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:45,320
- Moei, give it to me. - No, Thian.

1253
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,680
- Moei. - Thian, let go of me.

1254
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,920
- Give it to me. - Let go. This is mine.

1255
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,239
- Give it to me. - I won't.

1256
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,400
- I won't give it to you. - Give it to me.

1257
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:55,840
Give it to me.

1258
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,800
Oh, wow.

1259
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,160
Our dancers must dance pretty well.

1260
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,520
- Everyone is all up and dancing. - Not the dance, man.

1261
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,840
What is that?

1262
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,520
- Whoa! - What's that?

1263
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:06,960
Oh, I think it's...

1264
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,480
Our next show is a shadow play.

1265
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:13,679
No, this is not a shadow play. It's a sex play.

1266
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,520
A sex play!

1267
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,480
Thian just went back there with Natheerin.

1268
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,680
Don't tell me...

1269
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,480
- You go and look now. - I'll go tell him.

1270
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,360
It's nothing. Let's continue the show.

1271
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,239
Come on, let's dance.

1272
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,000
Thian. What are you doing?

1273
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,160
What the heck is this?

1274
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,920
Stop. Get out of here.

1275
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,240
Calm down and get out.

1276
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:40,039
You two were blocking the light just now.

1277
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,240
- They're now imagining things. - What?

1278
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:46,960
Are you gonna get to it right after the announcement?

1279
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,959
Go. Do it somewhere else.

1280
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,839
You've turned my show into an erotic one.

1281
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:51,959
Go.

1282
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,000
Toon.

1283
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,680
Beer is calling me now.

1284
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,840
Find your way out. I'm outta here.

1285
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,120
I'm coming.

1286
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,960
I'm here now.

1287
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,360
Tell them if that's the next show.

1288
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,200
No, it's not. Let's continue enjoying the jar show.

1289
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:08,480
If you want to join them, just come on up!

1290
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,320
Come. Let's dance.

1291
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,920
Give that to me! Whoa!

1292
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,920
Stop!

1293
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,960
If you want to ask Madam Sajee for help again,

1294
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,960
you can keep trying.

1295
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,520
I'll be cheering for you.

1296
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,919
Gosh, I hate you.

1297
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,280
I hope you mean that.

1298
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,040
Thian.

1299
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,280
Does this mean Thian and Natheerin are having an affair?

1300
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:02,159
I saw with my own eyes that TecTien carried her to his room.

1301
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:05,840
So those two are really having an affair.

1302
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,319
Moei is divorcing her husband.

1303
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,240
Everyone is going for her.

1304
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,960
Can you give this to Moei?

1305
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,880
Sometimes you are really sexy.

1306
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,840
Do you think you could plan a divorce without me knowing?

1307
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,719
I'll have to marry you

1308
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,800
before your plan succeeds.

1309
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,400
If you want something waiting for you,

1310
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:28,000
it's not hard at all, Moei
