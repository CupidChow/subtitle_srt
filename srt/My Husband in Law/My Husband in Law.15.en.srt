1
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,840
Why don't you prove you can do the same for her?

2
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,040
I've chosen this home to raise you in.

3
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,520
As it feels warm

4
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,640
like the home in my memory

5
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,760
where I was once happy.

6
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,520
It means that you have a pre-eclampsia.

7
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,000
If you have difficulty breathing, you can leave the oxygen tube on.

8
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

9
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,400
- Here's your medicine. - Thank you.

10
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,720
Excuse me, what is this medicine for?

11
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,680
They are vitamins for your blood.

12
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,000
Do I need to take them?

13
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,720
Yes, pregnant women need more iron than normal people.

14
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,160
It helps with the baby's development.

15
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,760
If you don't take them,

16
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,200
you'll be prone to anemia.

17
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,600
Ms. Natheerin has preeclampsia.

18
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,240
I would like you

19
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,080
to be admitted right away.

20
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,919
I need to stimulate the babies' lungs.

21
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,600
It will make them stronger.

22
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,520
It should prolong the pregnancy by another month.

23
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,720
After that, I'll need to take a sample

24
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,640
of the protein in her urine.

25
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,439
If there're still problems,

26
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,960
if her blood pressure is still high,

27
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,280
we'll need to perform a C-section.

28
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,920
Thian.

29
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
Why are you sitting here?

30
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
What's wrong?

31
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,640
Is it about Moei?

32
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,760
I think it's time

33
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,760
we tell her the truth.

34
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,920
Mom.

35
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,840
I've missed you so much.

36
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
It's really been months.

37
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,880
Your face gets all chubby.

38
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,080
Mom, I'm fat now.

39
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,600
You only miss your mom. What about me?

40
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,760
Aunt Jee, I've missed you too.

41
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,680
I've missed you so much.

42
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,560
Right.

43
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,640
Me, too.

44
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,840
Moei.

45
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,200
The reason I asked Mom and Aunt Prapha to come here

46
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,680
because we have something to tell you.

47
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,680
It's time for you to know.

48
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,599
The results are out.

49
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,280
Ms. Natheerin has chronic kidney disease.

50
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,560
This is probably caused by an autoimmune disease,

51
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
which I think she has it for some time now.

52
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,200
But we are not sure about its certain cause.

53
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,160
I have consulted with a kidney doctor on her case.

54
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,480
What we can do right now

55
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,040
is to continue with supportive treatment.

56
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,320
All right? What you have to do for me

57
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,400
is to take care of her diet and her lifestyle.

58
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,080
Any strenuous activity must be avoided completely.

59
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,080
Make sure Ms. Natheerin move as little as possible.

60
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,279
All right?

61
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,639
What we don't want it to happen is

62
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,079
the complication such as preeclampsia arising,

63
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,360
which could lead to kidney failure.

64
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,160
What happens if her kidney fails?

65
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,760
It will be dangerous for her and the babies.

66
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,280
Are you saying

67
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,480
their lives might be in danger?

68
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,760
From the blood results today,

69
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,080
your kidney is not doing well.

70
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,200
The doctor wants to have you monitored for a few weeks.

71
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
If it doesn't get better,

72
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,080
if the blood pressure is still high

73
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,880
and if the protein level in the urine is still high,

74
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,480
and your kidney gets worse,

75
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,440
the doctor said

76
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,320
they will have to perform a C-section

77
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,560
and put the babies in an incubator.

78
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
I see.

79
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,160
I'm not worried at all.

80
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,680
I trust the doctor

81
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
that he will

82
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,920
keep Moei and the babies safe.

83
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,600
Moei.

84
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,600
Everything is going to be all right.

85
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,800
We'll get through this together.

86
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
(Labor Room)

87
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
Please don't pull that face.

88
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,800
You should cheer me up.

89
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,480
Smile for me, okay?

90
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,240
Everything is going to be all right.

91
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,320
We'll wait for you out here.

92
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,720
All right.

93
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,080
I'll go in there right by your side.

94
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,800
We'll get through this together.

95
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,200
(Labor Room)

96
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,280
You can do it.

97
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,520
Lie down on your side and put your knees up.

98
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
Your chin against your chest.

99
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,760
How long is your vacation?

100
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,880
You've been here with me every day.

101
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,720
I don't see you work at all.

102
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,080
Forget about it.

103
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,840
I don't care if I get fired.

104
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,800
Because you and the babies

105
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,240
are my number one.

106
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,960
Yeah, right.

107
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,240
Big Daddy.

108
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,080
You know, having you by my side

109
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,080
means the world to me.

110
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,520
Do you know now

111
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,960
that you can't live without me?

112
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,400
It's all right.

113
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,080
- She's going to be okay. - Yes.

114
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,480
Give me the hook.

115
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,840
Here comes the first baby.

116
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,600
Here comes the second.

117
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,679
They're soulmates.

118
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,760
They're real soulmates.

119
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,800
You've been soulmates for many past lives.

120
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,280
You're physically his.

121
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,160
Your heart belongs to him.

122
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,519
He's been imprisoning you all this time.

123
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,440
Until you repay him back completely,

124
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,120
you shall lead a happy life together.

125
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,160
How can she repay him?

126
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,720
She has to repay with her life.

127
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
- What? - She has to die for him.

128
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
That's how she can clear her debt.

129
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,480
Does she really have to die?

130
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,920
She's all pale now.

131
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,920
She must be scared of death.

132
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,160
You foul-mouthed.

133
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,880
She doesn't have to die.

134
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,920
Only seriously injured.

135
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,720
But if you could survive that,

136
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,120
- Twins will come. - Twins? Really?

137
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,040
Two babies at once? That's great.

138
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,320
That will surely be great.

139
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
Keep my words in mind.

140
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,720
It may be hard for water and fire to be together.

141
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,840
But they need to coexist.

142
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
Just like the two of you.

143
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,840
No one can ever part you from each other.

144
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,600
If someday we really get twins,

145
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,639
how would you like to call them?

146
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,240
How about Mite and Louse? Sounds like a good team?

147
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,320
Are you really sure

148
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,320
to name them Mite and Louse?

149
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
You can't change your mind later.

150
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Moei.

151
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,840
You will never touch even my fingernail.

152
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,639
Just wait and see.

153
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,480
It won't be just your fingernail.

154
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,480
The fortuneteller already said

155
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,720
you'd eventually lay your heart at my feet.

156
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,600
Yeah?

157
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,200
If you can really die for me,

158
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,800
that day may come.

159
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,280
Ms. Natheerin is pregnant with twins.

160
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,440
- What? - What?

161
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,960
- Mite and Louse. - Mite and Louse.

162
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,320
Here's the other one.

163
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,600
So, how did it go?

164
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,239
Moei and the babies are safe.

165
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,160
Oh, I'm so happy. What a relief.

166
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
Moei did an amazing job, Aunt Prapha.

167
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,880
I thank you so much for being there for Moei.

168
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,559
- Yes. - So how are the babies?

169
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,999
Are they big and look like me?

170
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,760
- They're huge. - What about their skin?

171
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,160
- Is it fair? - They're like me.

172
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,080
- Come on, let's sit down. - Oh, my, their skin is like yours?

173
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,760
I'm sorry.

174
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,400
Thian.

175
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,680
Why are you apologizing?

176
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,640
I know how hard and uncomfortable it must have been

177
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,240
to keep it a secret from me.

178
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,880
Actually, I should be thanking you instead

179
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,400
for being a lovable husband

180
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,560
and

181
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,880
the best...

182
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,920
Daddy in this world.

183
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,520
I don't know where else I would find someone as lovable as you.

184
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,560
Do you know that? Hmm?

185
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,680
Doctor, her blood pressure is going up.

186
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,840
- In my both arms. - Holding both?

187
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,080
Yes.

188
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,879
- They're so cute. - That's great.

189
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,480
They say, don't call infants cute. Call them ugly.

190
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Doctor.

191
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,800
Doctor.

192
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,720
- Yes. - What is it?

193
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,839
What happened?

194
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,720
- Ms. Natheerin's having kidney failure. - What?

195
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,400
Easy. Let's sit down.

196
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,560
How can we help her?

197
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
We have to perform kidney dialysis.

198
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,840
But before we do the first time,

199
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,000
I need to do the surgery to make access into her blood vessels,

200
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,599
so the blood can flow

201
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,119
between the artificial kidney machine and her body.

202
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,640
Please save my daughter.

203
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,120
Yes.

204
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,400
Oh, Moei.

205
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,760
She's going to be all right. The doctor is good.

206
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,400
The most efficient way to treat kidney failure is a kidney transplant.

207
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,480
The patient needs to wait in the queue to get kidney donor.

208
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,200
In a year, there are about 7,000 patients

209
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,160
or 10% who undergo kidney transplants.

210
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,080
In the meantime,

211
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,080
we can treat her with hemodialysis.

212
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,560
I am told the family members can donate their kidneys to one another.

213
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
That's right.

214
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,600
And the success rate will be very high

215
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,640
when the donor and the recipient are related by blood.

216
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
Their kidney tissues need to be compatible

217
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,280
with at least 50% similarity.

218
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,160
I'd like to donate mine to my daughter.

219
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,360
First,

220
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,599
I need to examine your health

221
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,400
to check if your conditions are ready.

222
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,440
It's all right that you can't donate.

223
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,600
Moei can wait

224
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,000
for the kidney donor.

225
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,920
If she has to wait too long,

226
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,520
I'm afraid…

227
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,280
Don't worry too much.

228
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,680
I believe

229
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,560
that Moei is going to be all right.

230
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,920
All right?

231
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,720
Stay strong.

232
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,600
Keep your spirit up.

233
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Moei.

234
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,680
Can you hear me?

235
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,520
We haven't given names to Mite and Louse.

236
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,320
Moei, how would you like to call him?

237
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,840
What should I name you, hmm?

238
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,800
Let me hold you, I may come up with it.

239
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,360
Come on. Let's see.

240
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,760
How would you like to be called, hmm?

241
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,320
What should I name you, hmm?

242
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,320
How should I call you, hmm?

243
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,280
I want to name him…

244
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
Come on, wake up.

245
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,560
Let's name them together.

246
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,880
We have to name them together, Moei.

247
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,480
I won't let anything happen to you.

248
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,840
Please wake up.

249
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,680
Let's hold them together.

250
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,120
I'll treat Ms. Natheerin with hemodialysis for six to eight weeks.

251
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,400
But if her kidney doesn't recover,

252
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,680
she will need a kidney transplant.

253
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,039
I suggest

254
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,040
you sign up to be on the waiting list as soon as possible.

255
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,480
As it may take a long time.

256
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,120
In case we might need one.

257
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,879
However, she might recover

258
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,320
with only hemodialysis.

259
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,560
Can I still breastfeed my babies?

260
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,360
You produce a lot of breastmilk.

261
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,640
This is great.

262
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,199
I am sure Mite and Louse

263
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,760
will be out of the incubators in no time.

264
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,560
I hope they can come out soon.

265
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,600
I want to hold them

266
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,080
and feed them myself.

267
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,800
Are you sure you're holding up, Daddy?

268
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,600
Oh, piece of cake.

269
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,120
You're doing great actually.

270
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,880
Make sure you don't make both sleeves different sizes.

271
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,200
Come on.

272
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,240
Don't worry about that.

273
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,280
I'll make them as straight as a ruler.

274
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,800
By the time our babies come out of the incubators,

275
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,400
I'll have finished crocheting over ten sweaters.

276
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,440
I don't know why I strangely feel sorry for them.

277
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,600
What's wrong, Thian?

278
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,800
I'm sulking.

279
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,160
Forgive me, will you?

280
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,280
Oh. Hey.

281
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,800
Why did you stop?

282
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,320
Are we meeting the client here?

283
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,840
Yes. It's here.

284
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,640
We're late now. She's calling.

285
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,040
- Come on. Let's go. - Okay.

286
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,920
As you can see, it's worn out over here.

287
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,400
I suggest you build a new awning.

288
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,799
- It will prevent sunlight from getting inside. - Here's your coffee.

289
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
But…

290
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,600
Oh, no. I forgot my wallet.

291
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,080
Can you wait at the elevator? I'll come after with the money.

292
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,400
That's all right.

293
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,080
You can pay later at the cafe.

294
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,240
- But… - Enjoy.

295
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,320
Follow her.

296
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,400
Are you crazy? We're with the client.

297
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,079
It's all right. I can handle it here.

298
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,000
- Go. - No.

299
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,920
Is something wrong?

300
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,119
- No, not at all. - Actually, yes.

301
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,600
Kang's having a nature's call

302
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,440
but she doesn't want to be rude.

303
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,679
- Oh. - She's holding it in.

304
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,200
Listen, Kang. You should go to the toilet.

305
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,519
Because if you make a mess on the floor,

306
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,679
my housemaid won't be able to clean up for you.

307
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,960
- She's right. - I'll go then.

308
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,079
- Shall we continue? - Sure.

309
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,359
Now, about the building settlement,

310
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,280
we'll improve the foundation.

311
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,440
I won't let you disappear on me again.

312
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,160
Do you remember the day we met in the elevator?

313
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,159
What's wrong with the elevator?

314
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Hello, the elevator is stuck.

315
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
Hey! Kaofang.

316
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,639
Kaofang, wake up.

317
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,800
What do I do?

318
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,120
Of course.

319
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,080
That day was when I started having feelings for you.

320
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,600
I've been asking myself

321
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,800
when I first fell for you.

322
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,640
Here's what I found.

323
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,400
When you are near someone,

324
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,760
and your heart skips a beat,

325
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,640
and you feel so happy that you can't help but smile,

326
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,920
that means you like that person.

327
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,880
I like you, Kaofang.

328
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,640
I like you the way you are.

329
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,400
What about you?

330
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,840
Do you like me too?

331
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,080
Holy Moly.

332
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,960
Hey, what are you doing?

333
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,560
Wait.

334
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,679
- Tum, put it away. - I have evidence now.

335
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,880
I see red lipstick.

336
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,800
Tum, stop it.

337
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
- Stop it. - Oh, my god. Look at you.

338
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,480
- Oh, my. - I got lots of photos from this angle.

339
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,040
It wouldn't be convincing without the lipstick mark.

340
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Look.

341
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,800
Done. My first sweater.

342
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,160
Pretty good, right?

343
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,280
I finished two already.

344
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,320
Now you're bragging.

345
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,160
Mine looks better though.

346
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,800
Look.

347
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,080
Do you see how straight it is?

348
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,840
The design is exceptional too.

349
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,160
One sleeve is big

350
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,280
while the other one is tiny.

351
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,720
How will our baby get his arm through?

352
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,879
I make it to be most practical.

353
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,920
This sleeve is for when he's three years old

354
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,240
and this one when he's five.

355
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,960
I'm too exhausted to laugh.

356
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,960
Come on. Lean your head on me.

357
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,600
Mr. Thian. Ms. Natheerin.

358
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,320
After the hemodialysis, please go to the doctor's office.

359
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,880
Thank you.

360
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,520
Thank you.

361
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,720
Thian.

362
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,400
Thian.

363
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,920
Don't make that face.

364
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,600
My kidney not getting better

365
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,480
isn't your fault at all.

366
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
I know, but.

367
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,480
I'm sorry

368
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,160
that I can't help you any better.

369
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,360
You're doing your best.

370
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,920
I'm very happy

371
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,360
to have you taking very good care of me.

372
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,600
Do you know that?

373
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,840
You already make me happy.

374
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,520
Do you know that?

375
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,000
I'll get the machine ready.

376
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,680
The doctor said

377
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,320
you would get better

378
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,720
after the kidney transplant.

379
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,120
Now, we only wait for the kidney.

380
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,680
It might be a long wait

381
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,880
until someone donates a kidney.

382
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,000
Thian.

383
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,600
If I can't…

384
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,360
wait that long,

385
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,680
please take care of Mite and Louse.

386
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,840
No, Moei.

387
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,640
What are you saying?

388
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,880
Are you going to leave us?

389
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,480
I won't let it happen.

390
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,800
Thian.

391
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,160
We all meet

392
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,280
only to part.

393
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,520
I said, no!

394
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Look.

395
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,880
We'll grow old together, Moei.

396
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,480
You hear me?

397
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,000
Don't you want to see their first steps?

398
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,800
Don't you want to hear them talk?

399
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,480
We have to be together

400
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,600
and watch them grow up.

401
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,200
We'll see when they go to school, and graduate from college.

402
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,200
Didn't you promise me

403
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,120
that we would build a family together?

404
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Moei.

405
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,000
Moei.

406
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,840
Right now,

407
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,360
we only need to wait.

408
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,760
Ri. Mon.

409
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,560
I guess you overheard us.

410
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,040
Then you probably heard

411
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,320
what we've decided.

412
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,160
Thian.

413
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,600
I know how you feel.

414
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,520
But it's not easy to find a kidney donor.

415
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,840
It won't happen in a day or two.

416
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,720
I already took care of that

417
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,960
when the doctor told me

418
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,000
what was wrong with Moei.

419
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,800
I think this is the best decision I've ever made,

420
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,200
so I can see the smiles

421
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,880
of the three people I love most in life again.

422
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,800
At first,

423
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,200
I never imagined myself as a husband,

424
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,840
let alone a father.

425
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,760
But right now,

426
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,000
I understand what it feels like.

427
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,600
I will do everything

428
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,480
to protect my family.

429
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,440
You want to donate your kidney to Ms. Natheerin?

430
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
Yes.

431
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,160
Is that possible?

432
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,599
Of course.

433
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,280
You and Ms. Natheerin already have children together.

434
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,680
I need you to come in later for a health checkup

435
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,120
to see whether your kidney is compatible with her or not.

436
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,640
But you have to understand,

437
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,600
during the transplant process,

438
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,560
there may be complications.

439
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,320
Also, the recipient's body

440
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,600
may reject your kidney.

441
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,880
Do you remember

442
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,360
when I told you

443
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,760
that when I could learn to love you

444
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,880
more than you love me,

445
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,920
then

446
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,960
I'd be able to sincerely say I love you.

447
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,800
Now that day has come.

448
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,360
I love you, Moei.

449
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,360
For the woman, put the man's photo in the Tiger's mouth.

450
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,480
For a man, put a woman's photo is the Lion's.

451
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,920
I know I came here right now, it may be a little late,

452
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,880
but I just realized

453
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,720
that I love this woman.

454
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,800
I really wish her to be here with me.

455
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,080
Please help me.

456
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,000
If my wish is granted,

457
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,040
I'll come back to thank you again.

458
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,800
(The guy who's my love at first sight is my Thian.)

459
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,200
(And he's also my peer mentor.)

460
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,640
I'm sorry

461
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,720
for not telling you earlier.

462
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,120
I knew that if I did,

463
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,560
you all would have stopped me.

464
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,440
Moei sacrificed her life to save me.

465
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,200
Now it's my turn

466
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,160
to return the favor.

467
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,640
Where is the funeral?

468
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,160
Phlap Phla Chai Temple, Pavilion One.

469
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,760
I can't believe it.

470
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,920
His babies were just born.

471
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,520
Wait.

472
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,680
Have you talked to Moei?

473
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,120
Moei.

474
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,160
How are you feeling?

475
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,040
Mom.

476
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,280
Aunt Jee.

477
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,760
- Can I have some water? - Of course.

478
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,120
Slowly does it.

479
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,640
Slowly.

480
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,600
The surgery went well.

481
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,240
The donor's kidney

482
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,560
is compatible with yours.

483
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,480
Where's Thian?

484
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,400
Well…

485
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,200
Thian…

486
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,160
Thian is working.

487
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,920
Moei, you should rest.

488
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,640
Don't worry about him.

489
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,880
Jee.

490
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,160
I think

491
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,840
we should tell her the truth.

492
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,080
Are you sure it's the right time for that?

493
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,840
Yes.

494
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,760
Moei should know

495
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,640
what Thian had to give up for her.

496
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,800
Eventually,

497
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,400
she will find out anyway.

498
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,360
There's no point in hiding it from her.

499
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,160
I'll go in there right by your side.

500
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,360
I'm about to give you a spinal block. It won't hurt.

501
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,920
It's all right.

502
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,680
(Thiarawat has left you voice messages.)

503
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,400
Moei.

504
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,360
If you're listening to this, that means...

505
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,160
the surgery went well

506
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,120
and your body can accept my kidney.

507
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,120
After the surgery,

508
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,360
I don't know how long it will be

509
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,480
before I can tell you this.

510
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,440
So I decided

511
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,800
to leave you these messages.

512
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,560
I have so many things to tell you.

513
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,720
But the most important is this.

514
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,080
All this time,

515
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,440
you probably thought you fell for me first.

516
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,400
But the truth is

517
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,880
you are wrong this whole time.

518
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,680
I've always had my eyes on you. Did you know that?

519
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,760
You made my heart flutter.

520
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,640
That was the only time

521
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,680
I've ever felt that way toward anyone.

522
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,680
Then we got to meet again.

523
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,920
On the day I found out

524
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,080
you were that little girl, Natheerin,

525
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,720
I was elated and confused at the same time.

526
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,480
I thought that I had forgot the way I felt that day,

527
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,400
- but now I'm certain… - Home economics room, right?

528
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,640
You're here.

529
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,720
that I never forgot the feelings.

530
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,640
- Thank you. - I had for you that day.

531
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,240
I couldn't see your face,

532
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,360
but I remember your nerdy bob.

533
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,200
This can't be true.

534
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,840
I know you may not believe me,

535
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,280
but it's true.

536
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,160
I missed many chances to see your face.

537
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,840
Who's that, Mom?

538
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,280
That's Prapha's daughter.

539
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,200
Why?

540
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,560
- So, it's this girl. - Why?

541
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,200
She broke all my flowerpots.

542
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,040
Come on. That's not a big deal.

543
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,720
Mom. How can I hand in my assignment now?

544
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,199
Don't let me see you again.

545
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,599
Why? What are you going to do?

546
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,080
I'm going to make her eat dirt.

547
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,399
I didn't know that Aunt Prapha's daughter

548
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,840
and the bob girl

549
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,320
were the same person.

550
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,999
(Can you help me with homework? Peer mentee.)

551
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,400
- There you are! - Whoa!

552
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,079
- What the hell, man? - Come on, Thian.

553
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,560
Is your mentee asking you to do her homework again?

554
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,400
Yes.

555
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,119
Who dare to ask the class president to do homework?

556
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,080
I can't wait to see her face.

557
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,000
Me, too.

558
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,080
Can I put this here?

559
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,000
Look. I'll show you another one.

560
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,080
You're such a show-off.

561
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,680
- Look. - Wow, you got everything here.

562
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,240
So that's my mentee?

563
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,800
I was so happy to find out that bob girl was my mentee.

564
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,560
Finally, the day to meet my mentee has come.

565
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,480
But then…

566
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,520
The teacher told me to give you this.

567
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,240
Here.

568
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,680
It's from your teacher.

569
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,880
Thian left it before the end of the semester.

570
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,440
(Dear, Peer Mentor)

571
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,200
(Can you help me with my homework, please?)

572
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,040
I don't know if it's too late telling you this now.

573
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,080
But I thought you should know.

574
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,080
(You have received a new text message.)

575
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,640
I heard the surgery went well.

576
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,160
I'm happy for you, Moei.

577
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,240
I visited you when you were in the ICU.

578
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,000
So I recorded some cute videos for you.

579
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,760
I'm sending it to you in case you want to keep them.

580
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,480
Thian learned Tum that you ran to fulfill her vow.

581
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,960
Thian.

582
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,040
Tum.

583
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,239
What are you doing here?

584
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,600
I stopped by on my way home.

585
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,000
What about you?

586
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,440
I went to see my mom.

587
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,680
So I thought to take a walk for a bit.

588
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,800
I didn't even know how I got here.

589
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,080
You're worried about Moei, aren't you?

590
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,280
Bach when we were at school,

591
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,680
Moei once vowed

592
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,240
to run 100 laps

593
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,920
if she got married to her secret crush.

594
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,400
It was you.

595
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,560
After she got married to you,

596
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,360
I had to come here

597
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,640
and ran with her.

598
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,160
It took us days

599
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,680
to complete 100 laps.

600
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,119
Gosh, you're so tough.

601
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,480
I can't run anymore.

602
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,960
- Come on, Tum. You can do it. - Slow down.

603
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,600
I know she's not getting better.

604
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,320
So I came here

605
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,360
to make my own vow.

606
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,440
Don't worry too much.

607
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,480
Things will get better.

608
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,560
She's going to be all right.

609
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,760
That's not all.

610
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,960
He made a vow for you to get better too.

611
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,680
How many laps did you vow?

612
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,519
I vowed 200 laps.

613
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,680
I'll run with you.

614
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,240
I might not get another chance.

615
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,360
But I had to do it,

616
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,440
or I'll regret it forever.

617
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,480
Please let me be your husband and the father

618
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,280
of Mite and Louse.

619
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,520
Will you marry me?

620
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,960
- Oh, Moei. What are you doing out here? - Be careful, dear.

621
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,400
Where's Thian?

622
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,840
Aunt Jee, where is he?

623
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,360
Tell me, Mom.

624
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,120
Where's Thian?

625
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,160
Please tell me.

626
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,720
He's in the room next to yours.

627
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,600
He's in recovery.

628
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,800
Moei.

629
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,280
Why are you crying?

630
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,440
Why did you leave me such a long list of messages?

631
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,360
I'm sorry.

632
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,120
I'm sorry if I upset you.

633
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,840
Yes.

634
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,600
I'm upset.

635
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,560
I'm really upset.

636
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,280
I'm upset that you didn't tell me earlier.

637
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,520
You know, I almost pushed you away

638
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
because I thought I was going to die.

639
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,360
But you saved my life.

640
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,040
Now I'll get to see my babies again.

641
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,160
Wait.

642
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,240
Are you

643
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,040
saying yes?

644
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,440
I said yes

645
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,400
the moment I met you.

646
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,720
And I'll never change my mind.

647
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,240
I haven't got you a ring yet.

648
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,880
Can you wait until our wedding day?

649
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,440
(You have received a new message.)

650
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,800
(Moei and I are getting married.)

651
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,760
Guys, Thian and Moei are getting married.

652
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,800
- Man, that's great. - What a good news!

653
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,240
- Is this for real? - Yes, man!

654
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,480
- This is great. - I'm so happy for them.

655
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,600
What a good news.

656
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,160
I'm sorry.

657
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,280
(Thiarawat Wangyoonaan)

658
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,240
We finished this part yesterday, right?

659
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,360
- So tomorrow, we will start... - Yo.

660
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,400
Yo, we have a problem.

661
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,480
What is it?

662
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,280
A civil engineer

663
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,840
- knocked up a consulting engineer. - What?

664
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,760
- Who knocked up who? - It's...

665
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,080
Ri and Mon.

666
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,840
Dismiss Ri from this project right away,

667
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,840
and find a new head engineer.

668
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,120
Yes.

669
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,879
Mon, be careful when you walk.

670
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,960
- I'm fine. - Shall I carry your luggage?

671
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,800
It's all right. I got it.

672
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,399
- Ri. - Hmm?

673
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,840
We didn't do enough sightseeing actually.

674
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,320
We haven't visited Myeik and Bago.

675
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,360
Honey.

676
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,120
We should hold our plan to travel the world for now.

677
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,239
Focus on your health first, all right?

678
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,280
Look.

679
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,640
We're not just two of us anymore, all right?

680
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,760
Wait until the baby is born,

681
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,760
I promise I'll take three of us on a trip.

682
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,680
But you know what?

683
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,280
We can travel while I'm pregnant.

684
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,480
- Oh, the baby agrees with me. - Really?

685
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,320
- It wants to go. - Wow, nice.

686
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,600
I'll book the tickets right away then.

687
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,840
Yes, please.

688
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,160
You know, it's actually good.

689
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,360
We can now go to Thian and Moei's wedding.

690
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,560
You're right.

691
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,120
Let's go. Be careful.

692
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,320
All right.

693
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,160
Hey, stop acting all cool, Daddy. Get in already.

694
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,880
Here comes the most handsome groom in the whole wide world.

695
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,160
Here comes the most handsome groom in the whole wide world.

696
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,720
- So? Is everything ready? - It sure is.

697
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,280
By the way, we have one uninvited guest.

698
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,840
Who is it?

699
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,040
It's Korrakot, your former enemy.

700
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,440
- Why is he here? - To see Moei, of course.

701
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,040
He went to talk to Moei.

702
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,640
How could you let him inside?

703
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,840
Why didn't you stop him? We have to go.

704
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,480
Come on.

705
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,080
Let's go.

706
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,200
Let's go.

707
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,040
Come on, hurry.

708
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,080
- I'm going, man. - Come faster.

709
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,079
Why brake, man? Want to get your ass kissed?

710
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,400
They're going so fast. Come on, catch them up.

711
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,040
You look stunning.

712
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,520
You look so gorgeous.

713
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,760
- You look amazing. - Thank you.

714
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,400
- Isn't she cute? - Yeah, right.

715
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,000
By the way, where's Kang?

716
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,720
- I haven't seen her. - What?

717
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,359
- Ladies, I am here. - There, her voice comes before her.

718
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,040
- Just a second, coming. I'm not used to this. - That's her voice.

719
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,959
- Oh, wow. - Kang.

720
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,000
Hold on. It's so hard to walk in this.

721
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,320
Are you here to steal my spotlight?

722
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,640
Maybe a little, I can't help it. It's just my beauty.

723
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,120
This dress is very itchy.

724
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,600
But for this special occasion.

725
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,280
Hello, Natthamon.

726
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,680
Look. I'd like to apologize for everything that happened.

727
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,840
It's okay. It's all behind us now.

728
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,280
Right now,

729
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,800
you're friends with Kang.

730
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,279
That makes you our friend too, right?

731
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,639
- Yes. - It's all in the past now.

732
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,160
Anyway, thank you for coming.

733
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,440
Sure.

734
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,600
See? I told you.

735
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,640
By the way, she is not just my friend now.

736
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,400
- She's my love too. - Kang, you make me shy.

737
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,319
Gosh. That's enough.

738
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,920
Come on, just want to show off.

739
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,639
But right now,

740
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,839
let me introduce you to another bride.

741
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,880
What?

742
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,160
- Did you say bride? - Yes.

743
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,160
- A double wedding, you mean? - Oh, no.

744
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,000
I mean another bridesmaid.

745
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,799
- Are you ready? - Yes.

746
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,400
Here comes Kob, the brides man.

747
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,560
I've missed you, man.

748
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,320
You're so handsome.

749
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,600
Moei, congratulations.

750
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,040
Thank you so much, Kob.

751
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,800
Come on. We need a group hug.

752
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,000
Come on, ladies.

753
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,240
You can hug Kathy, too.

754
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,920
- Let's get a group photo. - Yes, let's do it.

755
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,840
- Come on. - Kathy.

756
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,880
- How should we do this? - Can you see me?

757
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,080
- Let me show off my boobs. - Yeah.

758
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,800
Calm down, man.

759
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,040
What can I say? It's obvious.

760
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,719
- Wait, Thian. - Thian, calm down.

761
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,960
- Wait, Thian. - Thian, calm down.

762
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,840
- Calm down, Thian. - No, Thian.

763
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,519
Let's stop him before it's too late.

764
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,320
- Thian. - Kob, watch out. Kob.

765
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:22,840
- Hey. - Hey!

766
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,880
Are you an architect or a thug acting this way?

767
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,240
- What's your problem? - Hey, wait, wait.

768
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,120
- What do you want? - I'm not here to fight.

769
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,560
- I just want to talk. - About what?

770
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,240
- Let's talk in private. - Hey.

771
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,999
- You call me nosy? - Yes.

772
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,560
Yes, it's personal.

773
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,400
Why are you still here? Leave.

774
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,560
- Let's go. - Come on. Follow us.

775
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,560
You might as well carry me there.

776
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,959
- Are you sure about that? - Yes. Do you dare?

777
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,600
- Of course, I do. - Wait.

778
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,240
Let me go. You're crazy. Let me go.

779
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,360
Drop the pile.

780
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,319
- You think I'm a pile foundation? - Yes.

781
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,880
Why would you wear heels?

782
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,360
You didn't listen to us.

783
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,200
Didn't you agree to step aside?

784
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,040
Why are you back?

785
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,400
Are you saying I'm not taking good care of her?

786
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,960
It's not that.

787
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,960
You're doing much better than I thought.

788
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,320
I only came to congratulate you and Moei.

789
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,720
That's all.

790
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,200
I'm sorry

791
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,560
if I make you uncomfortable.

792
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,200
I'm sorry

793
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,800
if I frightened you.

794
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,240
Believe in yourself, Thian.

795
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,800
Even I believe no one could take care of Moei better than you.

796
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,280
I wish you and Moei

797
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,480
nothing but happiness.

798
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,199
Damn it. What the hell?

799
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,279
This sucks, I thought they will have a fight.

800
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,120
Gosh. This is no fun. Damn it.

801
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,520
How about fight with us?

802
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,840
- Want a round? - Yeah.

803
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,400
- You ask for it? - Bring it on.

804
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,559
- Chet, is this okay here? - I've missed you.

805
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,800
Yes, it's fine.

806
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,880
- I think it looks good on camera. - Yes.

807
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,480
Okay.

808
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,880
All right.

809
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,680
- Chet, hold this. - Okay.

810
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,160
The sun is so hot.

811
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,320
Everyone, please put your hands together

812
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,839
for the best looking

813
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,640
bride and groom one earth.

814
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,079
Come on, holding hands is not enough.

815
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,480
- Kiss her. - Kiss her.

816
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,800
- Kiss her. - Kiss her.

817
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,760
- Kiss her. - Kiss her.

818
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,040
- Kiss her. - Kiss her.

819
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,760
Kiss again.

820
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,040
Whoever is still single,

821
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,000
come and catch the bouquet.

822
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,520
Who's single?

823
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,879
Are you ready?

824
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:51,919
Yes.

825
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,720
- Are you ready? - Yes.

826
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,559
- I'll throw it now. - Not too high, please.

827
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,640
Come on. I'm waiting.

828
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,440
- Come on. - I'll throw it now.

829
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,040
- Yes. - Over here.

830
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,120
What the hell, Chet?

831
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,000
You don't even have a boyfriend.

832
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,840
- It's not for me. - What?

833
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,000
Who is it for?

834
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,080
It's for these two.

835
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,880
Thank you.

836
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,720
Thank you so much, Chet.

837
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,960
You have to be a brides man at our wedding.

838
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,280
Really? Can I dress up as a woman?

839
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,760
Of course.

840
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,560
- Okay. Pinky swear. - You bet.

841
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:43,920
See you.

842
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,800
Since everyone is happy now,

843
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,440
we shouldn't waste time.

844
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,000
Let's party. Music, please.

845
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:44,320
Finally, I got to marry my peer mentor.

846
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,320
No matter how different Thian and I are.

847
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,560
But for me,

848
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,480
love is unconditional.

849
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,520
No words can really define love

850
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,760
because it's all about the feelings between two people.

851
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:19,800
Are you tired?

852
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,320
Not at all.

853
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,760
My support is right here. How could I be?

854
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,200
Sometimes, you really can't explain how you feel.

855
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,400
It's just happiness beyond words.

856
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,080
You want the best for them

857
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,040
and want them to be happy

858
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,680
without asking for anything in return.

859
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,920
What's wrong?

860
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,040
Well…

861
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,480
I need to talk to the staff.

862
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,319
(I learned this from your favorite movie.)

863
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,840
(Today is a good day.)

864
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,040
(Happy Birthday, Nott.)

865
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,040
Thank you.

866
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,160
(I wish you happiness.)

867
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,240
(I wish all your wishes come true. Have a good health.)

868
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,880
(From your brother who always wants the best for you)

869
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,120
(until I look like this.)

870
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,360
Thank you so much.

871
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,320
To everyone who's seeking true love,

872
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,960
don't give up yet.

873
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,280
Because your day will come.

874
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,120
Thian.

875
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,920
Did you write this poem for me?

876
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:03,200
If I am not too tired from work

877
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,640
and taking care of our babies,

878
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,320
I will write you one every day.

879
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,400
You know,

880
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,600
it's the most beautiful poem in the world.

881
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,360
Thian.

882
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,960
Am I pretty?

883
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,920
You asked me that every time you wore traditional Burmese attire.

884
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,240
Hey, wait.

885
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:36,600
Of course you are.

886
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,360
The most beautiful one here.

887
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,720
What about me? Am I handsome?

888
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,200
Of course you are.

889
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:48,960
The most handsome one here.

890
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,960
You know,

891
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,720
I'm here to keep my promise too.

892
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:48,000
When did you come here?

893
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,960
Well, I…

894
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,480
Forget it. Let's just say I came.

895
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,680
I wish.

896
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,800
Thian and I be together.

897
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,480
If my wish is granted,

898
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,000
I promise to come back and thank you again.

899
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,720
It's when you left me,

900
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,520
I didn't know what to do.

901
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,760
I was afraid you would fall for another man.

902
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,120
Thank you very much.

903
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,080
For making me happy

904
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,880
and bringing me back here again.

905
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,080
Sure. With pleasure.

906
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,360
Moei, since we're here,

907
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,880
shall we make another wish?

908
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,280
What are you going to wish for?

909
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:16,800
I want to tell the holy spirits that we got married.

910
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,000
- Now that we have two kids together. - Yes.

911
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,119
But two are not enough. I want the third,

912
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,800
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and more.

913
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:27,760
If our wish is granted, we'll come back here to thank them again.

914
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,080
- Thian. - Hmm?

915
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:33,920
- Are you crazy? That's five more kids. - I know.

916
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:36,199
Before you ask the holy spirits to help you,

917
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,880
you should ask me first

918
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,680
if I'm up for it or not.

919
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:00,040
Dear my beloved husband,

920
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:03,160
Can you look up and greet your lovely wife?

921
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,760
Do not be mad at fate for all the test we're given.

922
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:10,440
As in the end, we got married and are together now.

923
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,920
So please don't be sad no more.

924
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:17,560
We were born for each other.

925
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:21,440
We shared karma in our past lives.

926
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:24,240
Now gods in heaven want me to say…

927
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,560
I love you.
