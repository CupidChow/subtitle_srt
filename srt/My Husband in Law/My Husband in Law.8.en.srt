1
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,480
So I think it might have been a mistake

2
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,720
for my father-in-law to hire you to work for us.

3
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,000
Moei, get me that laptop's IP address.

4
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,680
The plan file of our Hong Kong skyscraper, I got it back.

5
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,079
- I think it's time we tell him the truth. - What truth?

6
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,160
The truth is I had someone handle this from the start.

7
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,920
You mean you've been working together to fool me.

8
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
Moei's actually the one who Mr. Baramee asked

9
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,640
to help catch him.

10
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,720
I hate traitors.

11
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,480
But as your husband,

12
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,399
I consider you've done a terrible mistake

13
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,600
as a wife.

14
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,799
What makes you think you could escape me?

15
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
You'd better watch your back.

16
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,199
Take my luggage.

17
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,640
Welcome to Dawei.

18
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,000
This construction site is enormous.

19
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,640
It's a giant project like its name suggests.

20
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,120
Now I get it why you sent me here.

21
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,400
It's a real tough one.

22
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,400
This way?

23
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,320
Yes. Please wait.

24
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,080
- Take it. - Ouch.

25
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,520
What have you brought? It's so heavy.

26
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,600
- No, don't throw it! - Hey, wait!

27
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,000
- Wait. - Yes?

28
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,880
How far is the base camp?

29
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,200
It's…

30
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,999
not…

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Stop!

32
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,640
not…

33
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,920
that far.

34
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,440
You're such a real pain.

35
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,240
Aren't you hot? I'm sweating.

36
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,520
You're so sweet.

37
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Excuse me.

38
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,520
How about get a room?

39
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,240
People might see you.

40
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,880
There are no other people here.

41
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,000
- Right, Honey? - Yes, Honey.

42
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
You must be tired.

43
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,680
Come on, I'll help you.

44
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,960
Seriously?

45
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,280
One is supposed to sleep in here?

46
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,160
You sure are.

47
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Your room is the best one.

48
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,120
My room is a lot worse.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
- There's something worse? - Yes.

50
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,800
Come on, stop complaining already, will you?

51
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,639
At least there's a place to sleep.

52
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,399
Learn to live in a wild,

53
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,839
and stop being so spoiled.

54
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,960
What did you say?

55
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,400
What I mean is,

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,280
you had a long trip,

57
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,960
so relax and get over it.

58
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
No, I mean you should relax yourself a bit.

59
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Okay?

60
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,560
Take it easy, Bro.

61
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
- Come on, Honey. - Okay.

62
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,040
I'm going.

63
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,800
- Bye. - Bye, Moei.

64
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,000
Good luck, Thian.

65
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,640
- Hang on, Ri. - Yes?

66
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,320
We should walk separately.

67
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,040
- I'll go now. - Okay.

68
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
It must be difficult.

69
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,080
They're husband and wife but can't walk together.

70
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,560
Others might see them.

71
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes, it must be difficult.

72
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,720
Clean up my room.

73
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,879
Good luck, Thian.

74
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,640
- Bye. - Hey, come back!

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,480
Bye.

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
The only way to get out of this place

77
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,480
is to finish the project as soon as possible.

78
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,120
So I can go home.

79
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,400
Rise and shine!

80
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,759
You're here to work, not to sleep!

81
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,800
Our project is far behind schedule. We need to pick up the pace.

82
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,959
So you can go home to your own bed. Understand?

83
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,720
Gosh! Whose voice was that?

84
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,400
It's Thian!

85
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,040
TecTien?

86
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
Get up!

87
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,040
- If you don't get up, I'll cut your pay. - Hey!

88
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,160
You.

89
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,800
It's Thian.

90
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,559
Hey, the new architect who just got here.

91
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,760
Is he insane or what?

92
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
He woke us up so early.

93
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,120
Yeah, you're right.

94
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,840
He might look handsome but he's like a rabid dog.

95
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,679
He's rushing us.

96
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,799
It's like he wants us to finish it by tomorrow.

97
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,080
- What's with him? - This is unacceptable. Go fix it.

98
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,640
This is not the time for gossip. Get to work!

99
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,960
So?

100
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,320
- Did you fix it? - Yes.

101
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,799
Then get back to work!

102
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,079
- Yes. - Why do you have to ask? Go.

103
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes.

104
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,880
Oh.

105
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,640
What the heck?

106
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,720
What the heck?

107
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm about to go deaf! Why are you screaming?

108
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm just happy.

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,960
At first, I thought this was my unlucky year

110
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,880
to be sent here.

111
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,600
I thought I wouldn't see Thian for the next two years.

112
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,760
And that I have to work with people like…

113
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,600
- Like who? Like who, say it! - Like who?

114
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,920
- Say it. - Like them.

115
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,200
But right now,

116
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,280
my TecTien is here with me.

117
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,560
I'm so overwhelmed.

118
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Bye.

119
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,000
Normally, she is always weird and wacky.

120
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,080
But since we've come here,

121
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,999
inhaling all the dust, she's gotten even crazier.

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
Chill, don't get so worked up.

123
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,160
It's still better than the Tornado Zone.

124
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,680
Not only is it hot there but also dusty.

125
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,800
That's right. It's the dust.

126
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
No wonder Thian is so grumpy.

127
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,880
That's so true.

128
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,639
Oh my gosh.

129
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,400
Look there, Sarah. Is that TecTien?

130
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,319
- Yes, George, it's him. - Speak of the devil…

131
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,599
Moei, you seem hot. Is it too hot for you?

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,520
- Well… - You can take a break.

133
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,280
It's hot for everyone.

134
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,960
Just hurry and get your work done.

135
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,400
So you can go back and rest.

136
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,560
It's fine with me. I'll go get everyone water.

137
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,480
Keep working, everyone!

138
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,600
Whoa!

139
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Okay?

140
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,520
- Where to? - This goes here and this goes over there.

141
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,480
- Go take care of it. - Okay.

142
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,240
There!

143
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,119
Kob, why are you still looking at her?

144
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,560
Moei already has a husband.

145
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,400
And her husband has followed her here.

146
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
Get over her, Mate.

147
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,120
I'm just wondering

148
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,040
what kind of husband and wife they are.

149
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,840
Don't you think it looks strange?

150
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,160
Strange how?

151
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,160
They're inseparable.

152
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,399
How is that strange?

153
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,720
- I don't get it. - That's what I'm trying to figure out.

154
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,000
I have to find out what they are hiding something from us.

155
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,600
Thian. Wait up.

156
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,160
- I have something to talk to you. - I don't.

157
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
Are you tired?

158
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,319
Don't try to make me feel better by showing that you care.

159
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,080
Oh, I both care and feel bad for you.

160
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,399
I know this place is in the middle of nowhere.

161
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,120
And you've never experienced hardship in your life.

162
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,880
I don't think you'll last here very long.

163
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
You don't think?

164
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
Then why did you tell Mr. Baramee to send me here

165
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,760
if you really did care?

166
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
Wait, Thian.

167
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,880
Do you know that being married to you

168
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,560
isn't an easy thing at all?

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
After we divorce, I'll be a divorced woman

170
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,560
and my name will be ruined. I also have to face many dangers.

171
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,920
In the home, I take care of you.

172
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,000
Outside the home,

173
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,240
I have to protect you from getting attacked.

174
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm nearly your bodyguard.

175
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,120
So what?

176
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,080
Do you want something in return?

177
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,840
No.

178
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,120
I just…

179
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,560
have a proposition for you.

180
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,480
What proposition?

181
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,800
I have two options.

182
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,160
First,

183
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,960
sign me the divorce papers

184
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,920
and give me 10 million baht within three months.

185
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,640
- What? - Then, I'll send you back to Hong Kong.

186
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,520
Are you crazy? 10 million in three months?

187
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,280
You're trying to suck me dry.

188
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,840
I don't have that amount of money.

189
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,400
So does that mean you won't divorce me?

190
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,800
I want to divorce you but I don't have the money.

191
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,640
They're two different things, got it?

192
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,240
In that case,

193
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,400
the secret about us being married

194
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,720
cannot…

195
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,800
stay a secret any longer.

196
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,719
Did you bring the marriage certificate? Give it to me!

197
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,400
Of course. It's the best insurance I have.

198
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
Give it to me.

199
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,680
- Hey! - Give me that!

200
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Stop! That's not nice.

201
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,520
What's another option?

202
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,280
The second option is so easy. Thian,

203
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,440
you just have to let me court you.

204
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,920
You are out of your mind.

205
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,120
I'm not.

206
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,280
Aunt Jee told you, didn't she?

207
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,360
If you can't get me 10 million within three months,

208
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
we'll have to get married for real,

209
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,040
and give birth to her grandchildren.

210
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,680
Mite and Louse are waiting to be born.

211
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,400
- You are really... - I'll give you time to think about it.

212
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,920
But don't take too long.

213
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,000
As my mind keeps zoning out a lot lately.

214
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,200
I might lose the marriage certificate in the wind.

215
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,720
The first option.

216
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,080
That's impossible.

217
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,160
Where would I get that 10 million?

218
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
The second option,

219
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,200
letting her court me?

220
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,040
That's crazy.

221
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,360
What did I ever do to you in my past life?

222
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,200
Why is the power out now?

223
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,040
The fuse isn't blown.

224
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,880
Here I come.

225
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,880
What nonsense are you doing?

226
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,400
What's that on your face?

227
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,880
It's Tanaka powder.

228
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,600
It's Burmese powder. It makes women pretty.

229
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,040
- Pretty ugly, you mean? - Hey.

230
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,040
- Why are you here? - To give you the flashlight.

231
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,839
I forgot to tell you they cut off power at midnight here

232
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,079
and turn it back on at six.

233
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,600
I know you don't have a flashlight.

234
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,240
So I brought you candles and a flashlight.

235
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,920
Just give them already.

236
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,240
Goddamn boondocks.

237
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,120
How is this room the best?

238
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
They're trying to make some improvements.

239
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,560
There are more people, so there's not enough power.

240
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,560
There should be no power cuts next week.

241
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,680
Just hang in there until then, okay?

242
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,520
Oh, wow.

243
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,720
What? What are you looking at?

244
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,080
Thian. I didn't see only one week but your abs...

245
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
are a lot firmer.

246
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,600
Why? Do you want to touch them?

247
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
There!

248
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,000
- Moei! - Of course, I do.

249
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,440
- I've wanted to for so long. - Stop!

250
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,760
Don't you have any shame?

251
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,120
Why would I? I'm going to court you anyway.

252
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,280
I haven't pick yet.

253
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,760
But I'm confident you'll pick the second option.

254
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,599
You're not an idiot.

255
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,680
You know how much I'm in love with you.

256
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,760
Besides, we've been through so much together.

257
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,440
I never want to be apart from you ever again.

258
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,640
You know?

259
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,920
Fine, if this is how you want to play.

260
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,400
Then be prepared to accept your fate,

261
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,480
because your life in Dawei after this

262
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,239
will never be in peace,

263
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,800
not even for a second.

264
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,480
Go. Go back to bed.

265
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,000
Thian.

266
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
But I want to start now.

267
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Start what?

268
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,480
Courting you, of course.

269
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,240
I'll wait and see how far you can resist me.

270
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,200
Bye.

271
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,360
She's crazy. Crazier by the minute.

272
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,640
Are you afraid that he'll get you back?

273
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,080
I'm not.

274
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,160
He can't do anything to me anymore.

275
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,120
What are you going to do? Tell me.

276
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,480
I'll do what it takes to make him

277
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
change his mind and love me.

278
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,759
What? Make him love you?

279
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Are you crazy? How can you make him love you?

280
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,920
Hey, sit down.

281
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,320
You're going to make him love you? Come on.

282
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,920
- You're losing it, lady. - Don't underestimate me.

283
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,399
Don't you know the saying,

284
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,240
"Constant dripping wears away a stone"?

285
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,240
But Thian's heart is like a diamond.

286
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,120
Nothing can crack a diamond, you understand?

287
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,160
If I can't crack it, then I'll just make it mine.

288
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,400
Got it?

289
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,399
You know, I haven't really made any serious moves on him.

290
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,240
- Right. - I'm confident that I can do it.

291
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,119
I have nothing to lose.

292
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,600
I want to spend the time I have left with him as much as I can.

293
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,280
What do you mean by that?

294
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,080
Hey, how many times have I told you

295
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,160
you need to clean up after you eat,

296
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,760
not leave the dishes for me to do?

297
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,960
Gosh, I'm in a hurry. Got it?

298
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,840
No, I don't. Go back in and do the dishes!

299
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
I won't.

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,120
I already applied hand cream.

301
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,520
I can't wet my hands.

302
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,400
Is that clear?

303
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,680
Bye.

304
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,240
Why do I have to be roommates with this crazy woman?

305
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,960
- What was that? - What's with her? Dang it!

306
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,160
Kang and Kaofang are going to hook up for sure.

307
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
How long has it been overdue?

308
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,039
Isn't this part is supposed to be done already?

309
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,600
- But Mr. Thian, we are short-handed. - That's not an excuse.

310
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,560
I don't care if we are short-handed.

311
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,040
We have to always meet the deadline.

312
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,200
I don't care how you will find more workers,

313
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,120
but this part has to be done by this week.

314
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,519
Understand?

315
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Yes.

316
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,080
Get to work! Do I have to make you?

317
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,640
Do I have to tell you everything? Go!

318
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,600
Try again.

319
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,520
It's running down.

320
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,439
I already reported it to maintenance.

321
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,200
They should replace it in a few days.

322
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,560
Why are you here by the way?

323
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,960
Thought you were heading to Hong Kong.

324
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,080
I was afraid Moei would cheat on me,

325
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,400
So I followed her here.

326
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm just kidding.

327
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,360
Don't take it seriously.

328
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,600
I know you must be mad at Moei big time

329
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,320
for what she did.

330
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,759
But I hope you're man enough

331
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,040
not to get back at her.

332
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,400
You know very well what I am to her.

333
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,000
I won't do anything to her.

334
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,240
Don't worry.

335
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,720
I believe you, Thiarawat.

336
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,720
I hope you keep your word.

337
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,720
(2 weeks later)

338
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Moei!

339
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,400
- Here's water. - Oh, it's so hot.

340
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Thanks.

341
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,760
Have you seen TecTien, the new architect?

342
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,960
He's so hot.

343
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,319
I so want him to be a father of my child.

344
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,600
Does he have a girlfriend?

345
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,800
He does.

346
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,680
I am the future girlfriend of TecTien.

347
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,240
You stay away from him. Got it?

348
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,640
Deal with it.

349
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,440
Let her have him. You don't want him, trust me.

350
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,120
He's good-looking, but he's so mean.

351
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,360
He's only been here a week, but he's been giving orders non-stop.

352
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,999
He's always losing his temper, rechecking everything.

353
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,440
I don't want to get anywhere near him.

354
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,880
Besides, he looks grumpy like an angry horse all the time.

355
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,440
That's so him.

356
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,240
There comes an angry horse with his helmet.

357
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,640
Stop it already.

358
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,720
He's looking more and more like it.

359
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,800
Thian!

360
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,680
Don't walk so fast.

361
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,160
I'm tired.

362
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,360
What?

363
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,359
Don't you know I'm sitting in your heart?

364
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,400
Wow. That's a good one. I love it.

365
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,720
Hey, Thian.

366
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,680
I told you not to walk so fast. I'm tired.

367
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,680
"We're looking for a team coordinator.

368
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,200
Applications are open until tomorrow."

369
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,640
Oh, wow, it's an opportunity.

370
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,000
I won't miss it.

371
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,440
(Recruitment)

372
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,600
(Application Form)

373
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,120
That part is where we were looking at in the beginning.

374
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Hey, wait. Pull over!

375
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,160
You go ahead.

376
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,960
- Hi, Tod. - What's up, Thian?

377
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,960
I saw the posting for an assistant for me.

378
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,520
Why? I can do this by myself.

379
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,400
Are you sure you still can?

380
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
- Of course, I can. - Everyone.

381
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,960
What do you think?

382
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,080
Can he still do this by himself?

383
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,080
I know you're determined and hardworking.

384
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,920
I don't want to lose a good hand like you.

385
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,239
But I can work more freely by myself.

386
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,160
I won't allow it. Okay?

387
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,320
Do as I say. Don't say no.

388
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,200
All right.

389
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,920
But on one condition.

390
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,880
I'll make the test myself.

391
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,280
I want someone who's good at solving problems,

392
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,240
not someone who's book smart, but can't think on their feet.

393
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,840
All right.

394
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,439
- That's Moei. - Moei.

395
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,960
- Hey, stop the car! Moei! - Moei! Stop the car!

396
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,360
- Moei! - Moei!

397
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,000
- Moei! - Moei!

398
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,680
- Hey, get off. - Moei!

399
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,560
- Beer? - Hey, Moei.

400
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,800
- Why is it so hot here? - Nott, Toon.

401
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,680
- Moei. - Oh.

402
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,279
- You're all here? - Toon, are you okay?

403
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,560
Take this inhalant. Hi, Moei.

404
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,520
Why does a pretty woman like you have to be

405
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,040
- in a boonies like this? - Right.

406
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,760
- Just look at Moei. - Shush.

407
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,920
- What? - What did you just say?

408
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
- I said Moei. - Slap yourself.

409
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,280
- You can't just call her Moei. - Why?

410
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,160
You have to call her Master Moei. Hello.

411
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,640
- Hello. - That's right!

412
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,879
- That's right. - Why...

413
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,960
- call me Master? - Well, Master Moei.

414
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,559
You're the only one who can handle Thian.

415
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,680
That's right.

416
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,560
That's true. We salute you.

417
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,240
Master Moei!

418
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,560
Please stop.

419
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,080
Beer, Nott, Toon, how did you end up here?

420
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,040
Now that you asked, I'm so pissed off.

421
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,320
- Yes. - It's Thian.

422
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,040
He came here without telling us.

423
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,720
And he also forced us to come here

424
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,599
- and struggle with him. - Right.

425
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,320
- Right. - He pulled his rank

426
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,840
- to make us come help him. - It's not right.

427
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,120
So you're here to help Thian.

428
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,360
- Yes. - Then...

429
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,400
he doesn't have to hire an assistant anymore.

430
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,840
- What? - Here.

431
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,440
- What? - What's that?

432
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,040
Don't tell me

433
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,440
you're applying to be Thian's assistant.

434
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,960
Yes.

435
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,520
- What the heck is this place? - Dig it. Just don't hit the water well.

436
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,799
Toon, watch the car.

437
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,480
Thian, you bad friend! You jerk!

438
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,840
- You came to Dawei without telling us. - Bad Thian.

439
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,640
And you pulled your rank

440
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,120
- to make us here to struggle with you. - Yes!

441
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,480
- You jerk. - Yes.

442
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,200
- He's such a bad friend, right? - Yes.

443
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,800
Friends who don't let you struggle alone

444
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,160
are your best friends, right?

445
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,320
- Thian. - Hey.

446
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,760
You're not dead, are you?

447
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,080
You're still alive, right?

448
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,080
What's with all your facial hair?

449
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,040
- I'm not dead. - Come down and talk to us.

450
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,720
- Oh, man. - But you're about to die.

451
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,840
- What? - We're going to stomp you to death.

452
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,440
Thian, we won't stomp you to death.

453
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,920
We will curse you.

454
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,440
- Yeah. - I curse that you get an assistant…

455
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,239
- Hey, shut it. - What the heck?

456
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,799
Nott, let me go. Let me get him, Nott.

457
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,680
Where are you dragging me? Nott, you brat.

458
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,760
What the hell?

459
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,040
- Do you have short memory, Toon? - What do you mean?

460
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,800
Moei said not to let him know.

461
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,040
Oh, right.

462
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,560
Keep your mouth shut.

463
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,240
Don't tell anyone about Moei applying to be Thian's assistant.

464
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,080
- Got it? - Yes.

465
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,000
Is she really applying to be TecTien's assistant?

466
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,080
Are you sure about this?

467
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,200
I hear they'll only hire one person,

468
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,000
but many people are applying.

469
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,680
I'm sure.

470
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,560
I don't get it.

471
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,400
We are going back to Bangkok soon.

472
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,120
Or do you want to stay because of Thian?

473
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,160
That's part of it.

474
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,760
I just want to prove to him

475
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,920
that among those many applicants,

476
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm still his best choice.

477
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,800
Hearing you say that,

478
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,520
it sounds like you and Thian aren't married.

479
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,880
Could it be

480
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,760
that this marriage between you two

481
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,000
has something more to it?

482
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,560
No, it's nothing like that.

483
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
- Hey, what the hell? - I know.

484
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,920
- Gosh, it's so dusty here. - I'm hungry.

485
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,320
- Why are there so many people? - Oh, my.

486
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,359
It's lunchtime. That's why I hate coming here around this time.

487
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
- Where can we sit? - It's so crowded.

488
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,480
Hey, it's Moei.

489
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,320
She's with that guy.

490
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,880
It doesn't look good.

491
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,000
There's not enough work to do in clearing and grubbing?

492
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,560
Is that why you're chilling out?

493
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,360
It's break time.

494
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,960
Moei and I can chill out, can't we?

495
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Yes, you can.

496
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,960
But don't you see there aren't enough seats?

497
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,920
You should have some common sense

498
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,440
and finish eating quickly.

499
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,640
So others can eat too.

500
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,360
Am I right?

501
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,440
- Yes. - Yes.

502
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,240
We're just done eating.

503
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,400
We're leaving. Let's go, Kob.

504
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Come on, please hurry.

505
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,760
What's these Hammoc people?

506
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,880
They like to chill out.

507
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,720
They have to be led and walked.

508
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,080
What do you call it?

509
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,760
Let's go.

510
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,880
Why are you staring?

511
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,960
- I'm not. - Let's eat, man.

512
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,120
Come on.

513
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,280
- Come on, man. - It's so hot.

514
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,759
- Hey, Nott. - Yes?

515
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,119
- Get Thian a glass of cold water. - Sure.

516
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,520
- Let's eat. Come on. - Oh, here.

517
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,480
- Wow. - Let's dig in.

518
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,800
- The food is piping hot. - Here's your water.

519
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,360
Kob, just ignore what Thian said.

520
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,800
He must be tired and says things without thinking.

521
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,320
Stop, Moei.

522
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,040
I don't know how you could put up with him.

523
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,160
Just five minutes with him, I could barely do it.

524
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,960
I guess I'm just used to it.

525
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,159
His parents must have taught him nothing.

526
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,199
That's why he is so blunt and never cares about people's feelings.

527
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,160
Kob, that was too harsh.

528
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,840
And it was loud.

529
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,400
I'm sorry.

530
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,640
Kob.

531
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,760
Wait, Kob.

532
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,640
Please don't tell anyone about me applying to be his assistant.

533
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,960
I'm afraid he'll try to stop me if he knows.

534
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,240
Please.

535
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,520
Thank you.

536
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,840
Why are there so many people applying?

537
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,280
Oh. A lady from HR.

538
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,040
- Oh. - I'm sorry.

539
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,440
Even an engineer.

540
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,960
Accounting.

541
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,200
Oh, my gosh!

542
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,760
Are you applying for this job, too?

543
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,360
Yes, Natthamon.

544
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,280
But I think

545
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,360
you seem to fit in clearing and grubbing.

546
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,120
I can do anything TecTien wants me to do.

547
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,240
And for the position of TecTien's assistant,

548
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,440
nobody is more suited to it than I am.

549
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,960
You seem to be so confident.

550
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,799
We'll see, because after the test part is done,

551
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,920
they'll announce the shortlisted candidates for the interview.

552
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
Oh, that's right.

553
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,240
I'm confident that my name will be on that list.

554
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,640
You are? We'll see.

555
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,640
Our test today is a written test.

556
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,320
You'll be tested on your basic knowledge

557
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,880
of construction management.

558
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,040
Five applicants who score the highest on the test

559
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,160
will be shortlisted for the interview.

560
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,440
Basic knowledge?

561
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,360
What do I write?

562
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,120
Please strictly follow the rules written on this board.

563
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,840
First, answer in just one line for each question.

564
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
That's cruel!

565
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,639
It might seem easy.

566
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,200
But who can write a complete answer in one line?

567
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,600
Second, be concise and straight to the point.

568
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,120
No rambling or meandering.

569
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,760
It's not rambling.

570
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,080
It's a preamble.

571
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,039
Third, if fail to follow the first two,

572
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,959
your points will be deducted, as it wastes the examiners' time.

573
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,279
The test is already hard.

574
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,360
You still find ways to deduct their points.

575
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,320
Fourth, don't even try if you don't know the answer.

576
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,560
All incorrect answers will cancel out

577
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,160
the point for correct ones.

578
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,360
Good luck.

579
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,800
Thian.

580
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,160
You're only looking to deduct their points.

581
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,920
Do you actually want an assistant?

582
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,320
Right. Why can't you come up with easier rules?

583
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,320
Have sympathy for the applicants.

584
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
No way.

585
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,360
Because my assistant

586
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,920
has to be able to follow all these rules.

587
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,160
What's wrong with you?

588
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,320
I won't disappoint you, Thian.

589
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,960
Here are the answer sheets.

590
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,719
This one submitted a blank paper.

591
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,000
This one left many blank spaces.

592
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,519
This one looks promising.

593
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,880
Hey, this one looks…

594
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,200
(Natheerin Sawadhirat)

595
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,560
You can never run away from me.

596
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,240
You can never run away from me.

597
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,080
What is it?

598
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,640
She applied for the job, too?

599
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,800
- What? Why? - Hey, wait.

600
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,920
- Why, man? - What is that?

601
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,920
Oh.

602
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,320
- What's the matter? - All the answers are correct.

603
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,640
- All the questions are answered. - Yes.

604
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,960
What are you up to?

605
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,360
All questions are answered.

606
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,880
They are all correct.

607
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,000
Let me see.

608
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,200
The list of the candidates for the interview is here.

609
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,160
Mr. Danai.

610
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,720
Mr. Krit.

611
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,440
I'm on the list!

612
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,840
Mr. Wathee.

613
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,400
- Natthamon! - Natthamon!

614
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,200
Natheerin!

615
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,600
Mr. Krit Jaruwati.

616
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,840
Yes.

617
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,080
Can you tell me the advantages and disadvantages

618
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,760
of PERT and CRM?

619
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,160
And which is more suitable in our project here?

620
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,840
(Out)

621
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,960
Mr. Danai.

622
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,199
A Gantt chart doesn't show the summary of the project outcome.

623
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,320
Can you tell me what its drawbacks are?

624
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,520
And what can we use in this process?

625
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,559
(Out)

626
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,160
- Mr. Wathee. - Yes.

627
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,520
Between the first to the fourth lines of work,

628
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,120
which one uses less construction time?

629
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,760
(Out)

630
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,440
Ms. Natthamon.

631
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Yes.

632
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,960
From the chart you saw on the test,

633
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,600
tell me which line should be

634
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,160
considered the critical path.

635
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,800
So?

636
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,760
I'm in critical condition myself.

637
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
I'm okay.

638
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,240
(Out)

639
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
Ms. Natheerin.

640
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Yes.

641
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:42,520
What are the most important in construction project management?

642
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,040
It's budget and time.

643
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,440
Now, it's the last question.

644
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,000
Who aren't married?

645
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,120
Someone who's married?

646
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,160
That's the condition you require for your applicants?

647
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,840
I just want them to focus on work only.

648
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,320
So, are you married?

649
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,600
Yes.

650
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,880
All right. Thank you, everyone.

651
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,360
You can leave.

652
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,520
As for Ms. Natheerin, please stay seated.

653
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,440
Please.

654
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,760
Why were our questions so difficult?

655
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,120
- That's right. - Her question was so easy.

656
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,320
But that question is the heart of project management.

657
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,759
We just wanted to know

658
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,559
if she would give a straight answer or beat around the bush.

659
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,839
It's still unfair.

660
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,560
You asked us difficult questions we couldn't answer.

661
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,920
- That's not fair to us. - That's right.

662
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,319
- Now, what? - That's right.

663
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,759
This isn't right. Our questions were so difficult we couldn't answer.

664
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,319
This isn't fair.

665
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,880
- My question was so long. - Stop, all of you.

666
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,200
It's because she got the perfect score on the written test.

667
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,560
The perfect score?

668
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,440
Seriously, are you really married?

669
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,000
You're still so young.

670
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,719
Why did you get married so early?

671
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,640
You're breaking all our hearts.

672
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,080
- That's right. - Damn.

673
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,560
Excuse me, how long have you been married?

674
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,600
About four, five months.

675
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,320
Isn't your husband worried working far away from home?

676
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,559
No, he's not.

677
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,920
He said he wanted me to try working abroad.

678
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,600
Oh, that's good.

679
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,760
Moei.

680
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,120
Why do you want to work in this position?

681
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,120
You're applying to be Thian's assistant?

682
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,200
- Yes. - Are you crazy?

683
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,600
- Right. - Why would you let him boss you around?

684
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,880
- Right. - Well...

685
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,560
I want to make up with him.

686
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,679
The thing is

687
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,840
my clearing and grubbing work will be done soon.

688
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,120
When it's done, we'll be sent back.

689
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,160
I want to stay longer,

690
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,000
so I want to switch to another team.

691
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,480
It's because I want to spend as much time as I can with you.

692
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,120
I'm going to make you love me.

693
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,120
- Moei? - I…

694
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,560
want to improve my coordinating skills,

695
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,640
and I want to learn from the best architects like all of you.

696
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
I see.

697
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
We old-timers really like your answer.

698
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,560
It's only you, old-timer. I am not.

699
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,560
- All right. - Jeez.

700
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,840
Thian,

701
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,640
do you want to ask her anything?

702
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,880
What do you think are your weaknesses?

703
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,880
I didn't always express myself.

704
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,080
Because I'm afraid of making a mistake.

705
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,880
I was like that a lot in the past,

706
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,760
but I think I'm not like that anymore.

707
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,639
Because I've realized those who never make mistakes

708
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,600
are not brave enough to learn from their mistakes.

709
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,960
What about your strengths?

710
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,120
My determination

711
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,760
and loyalty to the one I love.

712
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,000
- Oh, wow. - Nice one.

713
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,040
Hey, what are you doing?

714
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,880
Stop right there.

715
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,120
What are you doing?

716
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,280
I said stop.

717
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,720
It shocked you, right? That I got the perfect score.

718
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,120
I can do anything for you, Thian.

719
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,480
Get off of me. People might see us.

720
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,720
Hey, stop.

721
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,880
- Stop! - I can do more, you know.

722
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,440
Before was just a teaser.

723
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,800
But it's going to be the real show from now on.

724
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,160
Need my help?

725
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,440
Go away.

726
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,599
How's it going, Bro?

727
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,240
I hear that Moei is going to be your assistant.

728
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,200
Exactly.

729
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,480
From now on, my peaceful life

730
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,560
will be disturbed to no end.

731
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,640
Come on.

732
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,440
Don't let bias cloud your judgment.

733
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,680
Moei got the perfect score.

734
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,439
Doesn't it prove that she is capable?

735
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,480
Look.

736
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,280
Most importantly,

737
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,480
nobody is more suited to be an assistant

738
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,880
to such a difficult boss like you than Moei.

739
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,080
- Oh, really? - Of course. Look.

740
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,240
You know, you have so much negativity.

741
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,680
Throw it away. Throw the negativity away.

742
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,120
And your life will be a lot happier.

743
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,519
Oh, no. You're sighing again.

744
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,800
What's bothering you?

745
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,120
I'm scared of what she has in mind.

746
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,600
What else she's going to throw at me.

747
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,720
Oh, wow. That was fast.

748
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,440
Now you're one of members of the henpecked club?

749
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,640
Hey, watch it.

750
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,680
What are you talking about?

751
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,000
Come on, I'm just kidding.

752
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,920
Why are you being so sensitive about Moei lately?

753
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,839
Since she told me that she was going to court me,

754
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,360
she has been really aggressive.

755
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,080
Aggressive, how?

756
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,200
She…

757
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,120
She makes her move on me whenever she has a chance.

758
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,600
I'm getting goosebumps.

759
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,440
Don't worry about it. Come on, let's go eat.

760
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
- Are you hungry? Are you? - Yes.

761
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,159
I'm starving.

762
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,160
Calm down.

763
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:04,440
Hey, where is my food? I'm starving!

764
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,120
- Okay. Please calm down. - It's coming.

765
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,719
When?

766
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,119
Tasty food is coming.

767
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,000
Here it comes.

768
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,720
- Oh, wow. - Here you go.

769
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,400
Please enjoy your meal.

770
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,319
We can't eat this.

771
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,240
- Just eat it. - Go get us a new one. I'm hungry.

772
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,360
- Sis. - Yes?

773
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,320
Moomoo, new customers.

774
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,520
- Mingalaba. - Delicious food.

775
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,760
Burmese Pad Thai.

776
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Dawei stir-fry.

777
00:47:39,801 --> 00:47:42,040
- Cooked by wacko girls. - Wacko girls.

778
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Welcome.

779
00:47:43,081 --> 00:47:45,160
Please tell us what you would like to eat.

780
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,519
Or if you don't want to eat any food,

781
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,919
but want to eat us instead,

782
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,079
we can close the restaurant and serve you one on one

783
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,599
or two on two, any way you want.

784
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,000
Don't waste any time. Please come this way.

785
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,320
This way. Hello.

786
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,720
Please take a sit.

787
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,960
- You come here. - What?

788
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,960
- Please sit down. - Take a seat.

789
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,560
I'll bring you the menu.

790
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,080
Thian, that's Moei.

791
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,360
- Let's sit with her. - Hey, wait.

792
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,000
Let's sit here.

793
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,600
Hey, this is like back home.

794
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,840
Thian, hey.

795
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,800
Moei,

796
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,479
Thian doesn't seem happy

797
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,200
that you'll be his assistant.

798
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,200
Maybe not,

799
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,960
but there's nothing he can do about it.

800
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,640
That's right. We shouldn't worry about anyone.

801
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,960
- Yes. - Right now,

802
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,080
let's just enjoy

803
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,839
by singing, shall we?

804
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,640
- That's correct. - Shall we?

805
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,280
- Yes. - Okay.

806
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,920
Let me clear my throat.

807
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,520
- You sure you're not puking? - Okay, let's go.

808
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,720
Ready? One, two, three.

809
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,360
Oh, beautiful sea.

810
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,120
Bright blue sky.

811
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,200
I see a sailboat.

812
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,880
Sailing in the sea.

813
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,160
Enjoy your meal.

814
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,440
I see crabs on the beautiful sand.

815
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,920
Colorful fish are everywhere.

816
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,400
All the shrimp and all the clams.

817
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,960
Are in the sea.

818
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,040
- As the sun is setting. - I look at the plane flying by.

819
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,160
I start to howl to the sky.

820
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,480
- Gosh! - Hey, Thian.

821
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,680
Thian, what's wrong?

822
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,120
Nothing.

823
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,000
Bright blue sky…

824
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,200
What's wrong?

825
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,679
As the sun is setting.

826
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,320
As the sun is setting

827
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,840
I look at the plane flying by.

828
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,000
I start to howl to the sky.

829
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,000
Come on, pace it up.

830
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,640
Come on, guys.

831
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,040
Hey, you there.

832
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,720
Hey.

833
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,800
There's another one.

834
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,200
Can you carry one more?

835
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,520
Uh...

836
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,920
Do I have to carry them now?

837
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,280
Congratulations, you're a father now.

838
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,400
Huh?

839
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,200
What?

840
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,040
Mite.

841
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,600
Louse.

842
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,800
say Dad.

843
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,960
No.

844
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,120
This can't be true. No way.

845
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,440
No. This is not true!

846
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,040
No. No way.

847
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,880
It must be her creepiness.

848
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,360
That's why I had such a dream.

849
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,760
Hey, where are you going?

850
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,880
I'm going to see my husband.

851
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,000
- Come on! - You can't!

852
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,280
Moei, come back.

853
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,720
Moei.

854
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,040
What a nightmare.

855
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,639
Hey, Husband.

856
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,720
Moei.

857
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,920
- Moei! - Oh, Moei.

858
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,480
Hey, Moei. Stop.

859
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,159
Let's go home. Oh, Thian.

860
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,080
Hello, Thian. Hello.

861
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,120
I'll take her back right now.

862
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,320
I'm not going.

863
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,520
I'll go to my husband.

864
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,760
Moei.

865
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
Moei.

866
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,240
Moei.

867
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,120
Hi, Husband.

868
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,120
Do you miss me?

869
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,360
- No, he doesn't. Let's go home right now. - Moei.

870
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,360
- Moei, let's go home. Let's go home! - Hey! What the hell, Moei?

871
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,600
Come on, Moei.

872
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,320
Get up, Moei.

873
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Get up right now.

874
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,319
I'm not going.

875
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,760
You can't make me.

876
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,440
- Come on. - Husband.

877
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,880
Answer me first. Do you miss me?

878
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,760
If you don't tell me, I won't go.

879
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,000
Tum, take her back.

880
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,400
- Come on. let's go. - No, I'm not going.

881
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,720
You won't answer it.

882
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,560
Then I'll answer it.

883
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,360
- I miss you! - Hey, Moei.

884
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,760
Quiet.

885
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,639
Moei. All right. All right.

886
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,000
All right. Okay.

887
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Okay.

888
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,560
Okay.

889
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,960
I.

890
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,480
I.

891
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,480
miss...

892
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,960
miss...

893
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,360
you.

894
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,680
you.

895
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,840
I miss you.

896
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,760
That's it. I said it. Are you happy now?

897
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,960
That's so refreshing.

898
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,040
Okay. Let's go.

899
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,360
Thian. I'm so sorry.

900
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,160
Husband. Bye.

901
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,200
No. No more. Let's go. Go.

902
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,800
Watch your step. Moei.

903
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,280
Hey.

904
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,639
Gosh, keep your balance.

905
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,599
Hey, it's not time for a wheel pose.

906
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,440
Oh gosh, my head! Gosh!

907
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,280
Hey! Moei,

908
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,919
you can't just sleep.

909
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,000
Go take a shower first.

910
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,720
Oh, Moei.

911
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,960
When you wake up tomorrow,

912
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,760
and remember what you did,

913
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,120
how are you going to face him?

914
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,440
Gosh.

915
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,080
Gosh, the phone is ringing!

916
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,200
Hey, Moei.

917
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,400
Moei, your master is calling you.

918
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,160
- Moei. - Hey.

919
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,600
- Hey, where's my phone? - It's here.

920
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,800
- It's here. Gosh! - Oh, my.

921
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,800
Hello?

922
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,279
What?

923
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,840
You want me at the Phase Three site in five minutes?

924
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,080
Thian, can you give me 20 minutes?

925
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,360
What? No?

926
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,200
I have to be there in 10 minutes?

927
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,760
Okay, 10 minutes.

928
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,000
See you.

929
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,120
You'd better hurry.

930
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,360
How are you gonna make it in 10 minutes?

931
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,040
- Not this. - Aren't you going to shower?

932
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,160
- No, I'm not. - Hey.

933
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,560
- Moei, come on, come on! - Moei!

934
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,960
- Moei! - Moei!

935
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,760
Stop.

936
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,840
Welcome to the Tornado Zone,

937
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,400
- our new coordinator. - Yes!

938
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,480
Congrats on perfecting the most difficult project management test

939
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,720
and returning to the position you once held.

940
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,960
A million likes for you, Moei.

941
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,040
Thank you so much, Beer, Nott, Toon.

942
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,400
- Of course. It's a pleasure - Why didn't you come in?

943
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,400
What are you all doing?

944
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,920
Hey, don't blame her.

945
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,000
We stopped her from coming in.

946
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,080
That's right.

947
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,640
You know what time it is?

948
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,360
- Huh? - It's 9:15 am.

949
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,160
Work starts at 9.00 am.

950
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,280
What the hell are you all doing here?

951
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,880
- Get to work. - Yes, sir.

952
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,880
What a mean jerk.

953
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,520
- Hey, Nott! - Good luck, Moei. Keep it up.

954
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,880
You can do it.

955
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,200
You'd better not mess with Beer from Bang Bo.

956
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,360
I see only Beer from Bang Na.

957
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,880
Get to work.

958
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,160
You go first. I'll follow you.

959
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,320
Then come.

960
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,760
Yes.

961
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,640
Take note.

962
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,080
Your duty

963
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,520
is to keep notes of all project processes.

964
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,600
Yes.

965
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,800
Make it a daily report,

966
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,840
weekly reports and monthly reports.

967
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,920
- Got it. Uh, Thian. - Hey.

968
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,160
When we're at work, don't call me Thian.

969
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,480
Call me "Boss".

970
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
Every time.

971
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,520
Got it. Thia...

972
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,960
Boss.

973
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,480
They're so inseparable.

974
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,680
Hello, Mr. PI, I would like you to find a woman's husband.

975
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,760
- Hey! - Don't try to find Moei's husband.

976
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,160
- It's a waste of time. - Hey.

977
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,560
Give me back my phone.

978
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,680
I won't.

979
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,360
Hey, give it back to me!

980
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,720
Trust me.

981
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,120
If you do this,

982
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,960
you'll only get hurt in the end.

983
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,520
Why would I get hurt?

984
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,239
I'll be happy

985
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,480
if her husband finds out about them,

986
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,400
Thian and Natheerin will never end up together.

987
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,760
You're the one who'll never end up with TecTien.

988
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,640
Write the project progress reports

989
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,320
and make the charts.

990
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,360
Hand them in by 2.00 pm.

991
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,560
What? In two hours?

992
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,000
What's wrong, Moei?

993
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,160
Did someone do something to you? Is Thian bullying you again?

994
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,839
If he did something, you can tell me.

995
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,880
Yes.

996
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:36,680
He asked me to write all the progress reports by 2.00 pm.

997
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,440
- What? - He's out of his mind.

998
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,839
- How are you gonna make it in time? - Right.

999
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,320
- He's doing this on purpose. - Yes.

1000
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,240
- How about this? We'll help you. - Yes.

1001
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,240
- What can we do? - No one can help her.

1002
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,800
If I see anyone help her,

1003
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,760
I'll give you a written warning.

1004
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,719
Beer, Nott, Toon,

1005
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,920
it's fine.

1006
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,720
I think I can do this.

1007
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,760
Sure you are. You're good

1008
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,800
at no brainpower required work like this.

1009
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,120
- Hey. - Hey.

1010
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,080
Don't you dare help her.

1011
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,680
My boss is so good at giving out orders.

1012
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,720
Are you complaining?

1013
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,280
(You have received an e-mail from Moei.)

1014
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,759
I'm sending the progress reports.

1015
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,560
Attached are the charts you required.

1016
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,080
If there are any errors

1017
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,760
or if they can be approved and sent to accounting,

1018
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,440
please let me know.

1019
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,920
I adore you so much.

1020
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,960
Yours sincerely.

1021
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,280
Dear Ms. Natheerin,

1022
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,479
I've received the reports.

1023
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,560
I'd like you to do five more.

1024
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,000
- Five more? - ...in the form of summaries and graphs.

1025
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,400
Please finish them by 5 pm today.

1026
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,520
- 5 pm? - 5 pm?

1027
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,320
Yes, 5 pm. I wrote it.

1028
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,800
You're so mean.

1029
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,919
I was only courting you a little,

1030
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,040
and you asked me to write five reports.

1031
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,639
I really want to know,

1032
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,240
between the husband and the wife,

1033
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,840
who will give up first.

1034
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,440
I want to know that too.

1035
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,560
Here are five reports done by 5 as you requested, Boss.

1036
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,600
Why didn't you e-mail them?

1037
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,159
I did, and also printed them out.

1038
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,000
So you can save time.

1039
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,840
- Nice one. - All done?

1040
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,360
Wait.

1041
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,800
Is there a mistake?

1042
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,240
There's none.

1043
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,480
So does it need to be fixed?

1044
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,080
No.

1045
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,880
Perfect!

1046
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,280
- You did a perfect job, Moei. - Bravo.

1047
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,440
I'll get going then, Boss.

1048
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,920
Bye, see you tomorrow.

1049
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,920
- I'm going now, Guys. Bye. - Bye.

1050
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,120
- See you. - Get home safe.

1051
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,040
If there's anything else, just e-mail me anytime.

1052
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,760
You're such a hardworking person.

1053
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,840
She finished her work on time, too.

1054
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,240
She had a lot of work, but she got it done on time.

1055
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,840
Gosh, Thian.

1056
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,400
I know you're giving me so much work to make me quit.

1057
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,800
Do you really think I'll give up easily?

1058
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,880
I've come so far.

1059
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,440
I won't give up.

1060
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,080
Hey.

1061
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,560
Hey, you.

1062
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,079
It's for sitting, not sleeping.

1063
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,480
Get up right now.

1064
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,760
Why?

1065
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,120
Are you mad that I got this job?

1066
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,840
Yes! You got that right!

1067
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,400
Because you got the position unfairly.

1068
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,400
Hey, how did I get it unfairly?

1069
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,760
- Hmm? - You traded your body.

1070
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,520
Hey, wait.

1071
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,960
Who are you to insult me like that?

1072
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,600
That's right. I'm insulting you.

1073
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,240
Oh, gosh.

1074
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,560
You act all shy.

1075
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,079
But you threw yourself at men.

1076
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,960
Which men on this site you haven't?

1077
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,920
Hey, that's too much.

1078
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,440
You need to apologize.

1079
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,000
No!

1080
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,600
I'm just saying the truth.

1081
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,920
What truth? It's just your imagination.

1082
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,440
Don't think that other people are like you.

1083
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,320
- Are you insulting me? - Yes.

1084
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,439
I'm insulting you. I'll insult you more

1085
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,080
if you keep spewing this nonsense.

1086
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,480
Hey, do you think you can just walk away from me?

1087
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,640
- Think you can just walk away? - Hey.

1088
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,280
Are you okay?

1089
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,000
Are you okay?

1090
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,360
You're bleeding.

1091
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,640
- Does it hurt? - Blood!

1092
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,880
- Gosh - Stay still.

1093
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,240
Are you treating it with your foot? It hurts!

1094
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,520
If you don't stop, then do it yourself.

1095
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,600
It hurts. But keep going.

1096
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,320
Be gentle.

1097
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,840
It's all Moei's fault.

1098
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,400
I almost had to redo my nose.

1099
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,640
So who started it?

1100
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,320
Are you saying I started it?

1101
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:58,360
Of course. I know Moei well. Moei wouldn't throw the first punch.

1102
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,800
But you, you have a bad mouth.

1103
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,120
So she got you, didn't you?

1104
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,160
Okay, you're right.

1105
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,800
I'm not a nice person. I'm not clever, not perfect like Moei.

1106
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,439
So from now on, just leave me alone.

1107
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,440
Hey.

1108
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,720
Say it again. It's you who didn't leave me alone.

1109
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,120
Say it. I shouldn't have helped you.

1110
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,280
You're such an ungrateful snake.

1111
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,400
Damn it.

1112
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,080
- A snake? - Yes!

1113
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,880
First,

1114
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,880
sign me the divorce papers

1115
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,840
and give me 10 million within three months.

1116
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,280
What's another option?

1117
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,440
You just have to let me court you.

1118
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,280
I'm confident that you'll pick the second option,

1119
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,880
You're not an idiot.

1120
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,360
You know very well how much I'm in love with you.

1121
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,160
Besides, we've already been through so much together.

1122
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,600
I never want to be part from you again.

1123
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,160
You'd better watch out.

1124
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,840
As the old saying goes,

1125
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,160
you'll end up with what you hate.

1126
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,840
If one day you fall for Moei,

1127
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,520
I'll laugh until all my teeth come off.

1128
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,480
You won't get to do that.

1129
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,480
- Why not? - That day will never come.

1130
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,279
- Hey, this one. I found my soulmate. - How many meters, kilometers away?

1131
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,039
- I met her on Facebook. - On Facebook?

1132
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,040
- Just turn on the location. - That's awesome.

1133
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,560
Are you going to see her?

1134
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,880
Thank you.

1135
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,599
Hey. Guys!

1136
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,400
Please stand and greet.

1137
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,320
- Our Chet has arrived. - Chet.

1138
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,679
- Chet. - Hello, Chet.

1139
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,559
Chet, you being here, I have to say,

1140
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,240
you really give us the motivation we need.

1141
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,600
Please have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.

1142
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,120
Hey, Nott. Get him some water quickly.

1143
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,800
Look at you, did you just take a shower? Your back is damp.

1144
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,320
Chet, your water.

1145
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,600
- Very good. - Go on.

1146
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,000
- Yes. - Hey.

1147
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,880
Oh, wow, why are you all covered with dust?

1148
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,160
I thought I was dirty.

1149
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,880
Hey, what are you doing?

1150
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,560
Hey! Stop, Moei.

1151
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,160
Stop it. I said stop!

1152
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,040
Can't you see Chet is right here?

1153
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,360
Chet.

1154
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,520
- Hello, Chet. - Hello.

1155
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,000
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

1156
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,160
It's okay.

1157
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,400
I was wondering if the work was too hard, but now

1158
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,720
by looking at you, I think I got the answer.

1159
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,800
- Hey, be careful. - Have a seat.

1160
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,760
Okay.

1161
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,520
Thian, aren't you making her work too hard?

1162
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,120
Now, I'm worried.

1163
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,240
Yes, he is.

1164
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,000
Don't worry. She's like a Kubota.

1165
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,520
She has survived harder things.

1166
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:47,320
They say couples who fight a lot will have a lot of children.

1167
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,560
If that's the case, I'd rather die.

1168
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:59,160
Before you die on me, I'd better go check the construction site.

1169
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,440
- See you, Moei. - See you.

1170
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,840
- See you later. - See you, Chet.

1171
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,279
- What are you playing here? - It's good that Chet is here.

1172
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,639
Work will run more smoothly.

1173
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,000
- We'll see. - It's his first day.

1174
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,200
(Moei has joined the group.)

1175
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,520
(Moei)

1176
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,640
I wonder if my husband is too mean.

1177
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,480
It's so hard to pursue him.

1178
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,200
I can't woo him too much,

1179
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,880
or he'll give me too much to do.

1180
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,480
Five reports since early.

1181
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,160
I nearly fell and died.

1182
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,440
With love, from Kubota.

1183
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,280
Look at him all grumpy.

1184
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,080
"It's still early, want to start a fight?"

1185
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,080
"I don't want to yell at anyone before noon."

1186
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,880
"When will you start writing the reports?"

1187
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,240
"Or do you want a little whack to get you started?

1188
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,079
Please work hard on your tasks.

1189
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,480
Don't make me use a stick."

1190
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,280
I'm sorry.

1191
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,120
TecTien the Beastly Architect.

1192
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,240
You act like a nearly retired old man.

1193
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,920
Always nag and complain. It gets old.

1194
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,640
Want to be a father, Thian? A child might change you.

1195
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,440
I can get pregnant easily.

1196
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,120
Just open your eyes

1197
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,000
and look at me.

1198
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,840
Then you'll see what love looks like.

1199
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,480
What prank are you pulling?

1200
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,280
Work as hard as you play this nonsense.

1201
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,640
What nonsense?

1202
01:15:35,107 --> 01:15:37,440
There you go, the report on Phase Two.

1203
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,600
I finished it and I wanted to give it to you.

1204
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:41,760
Then give it.

1205
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,160
What are you waiting for?

1206
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,240
Get back to work.

1207
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,240
Yes, Sir.

1208
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,000
Boss.

1209
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,840
Bye.

1210
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,320
Let's get some air-con in here.

1211
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,280
It's so damn hot.

1212
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,200
Tell me, how are the two of them?

1213
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,680
Are they getting along well?

1214
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,480
They aren't killing each other, right?

1215
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,199
Oh, don't worry about it.

1216
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,400
Situations are under controlled. No sign of Tornedo.

1217
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,439
Really? That's strange.

1218
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,279
Normally, Thian is not so kind.

1219
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,280
That's true.

1220
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,240
I guess they got tired of fighting.

1221
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,880
But this morning, a little skirmish in the group chat.

1222
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,840
And he told her to write the reports.

1223
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,360
- Seven of them. - Seven?

1224
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,720
Yes. Seven reports.

1225
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,680
Well, Moei started it with her flirty words.

1226
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,800
But I think she's funny.

1227
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,480
What is Moei doing there?

1228
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,080
Where?

1229
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,719
I know why she is there.

1230
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,760
- Why? - Why?

1231
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,880
The group chat.

1232
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,120
- What group chat? - Our group chat.

1233
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,719
We have a group chat.

1234
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,799
Listen here, Chet.

1235
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,039
"Were you born a fighting fish in your past life?

1236
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,559
All you do is think about mating.

1237
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,119
You're too obsessed. Don't even think of doing it with me.

1238
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,359
See that pie in the sky?

1239
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,720
That's where your hope lies.

1240
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,679
Write your reports there.

1241
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,040
Don't come back until they're done."

1242
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,120
There!

1243
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,320
- That's really harsh. - TecTien the Beastly.

1244
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,520
They say couples who fight a lot will have a lot of children.

1245
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,760
The dream, Chet's words,

1246
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,560
and those cheesy love poems.

1247
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,000
Are they signs of what's to come?

1248
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,120
Like Indra disguised as a human.

1249
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,760
Bushy brows, chiseled jaw, what a man.

1250
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:07,480
All the beauty from all the heavens

1251
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:12,320
came to life and stay in my mind.

1252
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,880
There is no man like him.

1253
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,960
He's a man with equal.

1254
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,320
So striking that is hard to believe he's just a man.

1255
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:33,160
So gorgeous that it hurts my soul.

1256
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,720
His beauty captivates the whole world.

1257
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:44,000
Who will be lucky to win his love?

1258
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:49,880
I can sit here and look at him all day long.

1259
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:56,440
Eternity can pass I will not know.

1260
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,960
In Dawei, no one is as stunning.

1261
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,560
Just his shadow makes me delusional.

1262
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,880
With that skin so fair and silky,

1263
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,160
Yes, he's my one and only husband.

1264
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:36,040
He's getting finer by the days.

1265
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:40,320
Everyone is allured by his charm.

1266
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:45,720
None can stop loving him nor taking him off their mind.

1267
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:50,920
Even though they can never have him.

1268
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:56,160
On the ground, he's already so handsome.

1269
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,480
In the water, he's just as nice-looking.

1270
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:06,600
Either left or right angle, he's appealing.

1271
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:12,200
I should try courting him, to make him mine.

1272
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:21,240
So tall, so strong, so hunky.

1273
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,480
I only wish he could be less mean for a bit.

1274
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,560
He's so hot and so hard to woo.

1275
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:36,720
But I'll keep trying as long as I live.

1276
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,280
Even though we're married, my heart is still worried.

1277
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:47,680
Because I wasn't born with a medal of bravery,

1278
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:54,560
I'll stay here in my dream for eternity.

1279
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,120
What about the reports? Are you done?

1280
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,560
Hey, why are you smiling?

1281
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,600
Hey, why are you smiling?

1282
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,920
What did you say?

1283
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,840
Have you finished the reports?

1284
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,320
I'm doing them right now.

1285
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,159
Don't lie to me.

1286
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,640
I saw you were daydreaming.

1287
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,040
Just stop slack off.

1288
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,960
Thian, you really know me too well.

1289
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,239
You're so adorable.

1290
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,040
How could I not love you?

1291
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,680
Hand in the reports in an hour.

1292
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,919
Yes, Sir.

1293
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,880
I'll get right on it.

1294
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,240
You're always slacking off.

1295
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,240
You're always complaining and nagging.

1296
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,200
Can't you see I'm working right now?

1297
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,040
It's because I told you to. Can't you just be more hard-working?

1298
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,320
Thian.

1299
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,000
Seriously, you keep me busy.

1300
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,520
to stop me from courting you.

1301
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,800
- Right? I don't want me to court you, right? - Shut it.

1302
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,360
If you say the word again…

1303
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,000
- What will you do? - I'll make you write five more reports.

1304
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,240
Hey, Thian. Wait.

1305
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,520
What now?

1306
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,880
I just want to see your face.

1307
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,360
Stop playing along.

1308
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,560
Can I say I miss you?

1309
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,200
And please do if you miss me.

1310
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,480
Congratulations to Thian's new assistant.

1311
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,360
Cheers!

1312
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,800
Thank you so much.

1313
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,520
I promise I'll do my best as Thian's assistant.

1314
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,040
- Perfect. - Perfect.

1315
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,960
Is he not mad at you anymore?

1316
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,880
Actually, I keep doing things that make him mad at me.

1317
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,759
You troublemaker.

1318
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,600
- We saw what you did though. - Right.

1319
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,600
Right now, Yada is quiet.

1320
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,240
And Pondej is laying low.

1321
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,360
So Thian will divorce you soon, right?

1322
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,560
Yes. If…

1323
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,520
Yada and Pondej leaves him alone,

1324
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,840
my fake wedding will eventually end.

1325
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,999
That's good, Moei.

1326
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,840
That way, you'll be single again.

1327
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,840
You can find yourself a husband that's 100 times better than him.

1328
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,280
Nott, keep your voice down.

1329
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,400
Someone might hear it and tell on.

1330
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,999
Come on, man. Who would understand us?

1331
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,400
- They're Burmese. - No one can understand us.

1332
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,640
That's right.

1333
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,160
Don't worry, Beer.

1334
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,760
Kob, what are you doing here?

1335
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,280
Moei, I know why you and Thian are married.

1336
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:37,920
Moei.

1337
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,960
Can you give me a chance?

1338
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,560
Kob.

1339
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,000
I won't give up. I'll wait for the day

1340
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,160
when you divorce him.

1341
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,360
I'll do everything

1342
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,600
to make you look at me.

1343
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,760
- Kob. - Hey.

1344
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,600
I don't know what Moei told you.

1345
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,120
But I don't think it's any of your business.

1346
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,800
- Come here. - I know.

1347
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,600
I never really questioned

1348
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,480
about your relationship.

1349
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,080
I never meant to meddle in your personal life.

1350
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,760
Good. Then you should stop.

1351
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,240
I will.

1352
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,000
Because I now know

1353
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,760
why you married Moei.

1354
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,520
I'm man enough not to tell anyone about it.

1355
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,600
I hope you'll keep your word.

1356
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,640
I'm not done talking with her.

1357
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:41,680
You're not?

1358
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,640
Fine.

1359
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,840
You can talk now. I'll be listening, too.

1360
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:51,800
As I can't trust what else she'll reveal to you.

1361
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,360
I want to talk to her in private.

1362
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:02,920
I won't allow it.

1363
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:20,680
Thian.

1364
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,360
How many times do I have to scold you

1365
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,560
so you remember that our marriage must stay a secret?

1366
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,640
What is this?

1367
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,320
You even told that guy about our terms.

1368
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:34,800
Are you crazy?

1369
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,640
- I didn't tell him. - Don't give me an excuse.

1370
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,440
You know what?

1371
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,719
I really don't mind

1372
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,200
if you like that guy.

1373
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,560
Really?

1374
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,880
Yes.

1375
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,040
That's even better.

1376
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,640
So I don't have to find 10 million to give you

1377
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,120
to get you to divorce me.

1378
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,600
That day will never come.

1379
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,480
You can mark my word.

1380
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,800
If you can't give me 10 million,

1381
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,400
you will have to be mine.

1382
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,760
Because I'll pursue you to the end

1383
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,120
until you give in to me.

1384
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,960
Fine.

1385
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,400
We'll see.

1386
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,240
Who knows you might give in to Korrakot before that.

1387
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,080
Can you give me a chance?

1388
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,720
Kob.

1389
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,360
I won't give up. I'll wait for the day

1390
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,640
when you divorce him.

1391
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,560
What?

1392
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,480
How did he find out?

1393
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,840
Are you sure you haven't told anyone?

1394
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:03,440
Yes, I'm sure. I never talked with anyone about it.

1395
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,920
I swear.

1396
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,160
Never mind.

1397
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:10,000
I'm more worried about something else.

1398
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,120
How am I supposed to act around Kob now?

1399
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,440
Come on.

1400
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,039
You don't need to do things differently.

1401
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:25,800
Just be your beautiful self and let the guy pursue you.

1402
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,360
- I can't. - Why not?

1403
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,360
If I do that,

1404
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,600
Thian may think I like another man.

1405
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:34,840
You are right.

1406
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,840
What makes he think I'd be interested in another man?

1407
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,640
Could it be...

1408
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,280
I haven't made it clear enough I like him?

1409
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,280
A toast with chocolate and condensed milk.

1410
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,760
- Oh, wow. - And rice porridge with shrimp.

1411
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,640
I know you spread the milk yourself,

1412
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:17,159
and bought this porridge straight from the market.

1413
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:18,400
That's right.

1414
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:19,520
Oh, my chin…

1415
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,760
These are for you, Moei.

1416
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,720
Oh.

1417
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,920
Am I dreaming?

1418
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:31,800
Take the flowers.

1419
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,360
Thank you, Kob.

1420
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,800
Finally, man.

1421
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,240
She's married

1422
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,880
but still involved with two men at the same time.

1423
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,600
And others are supporting it.

1424
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,320
How is this okay?

1425
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:04,560
- Make it quick. Try to push it. - Yes, Sir.

1426
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,240
TecTien.

1427
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,640
TecTien.

1428
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,000
You know, right now, everybody is talking

1429
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,680
that your assistant is having an affair with Korrakot.

1430
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,320
Where did you hear that?

1431
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,760
This morning,

1432
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,640
I saw Korrakot

1433
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:26,200
bring Natheerin flowers.

1434
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:30,600
If she didn't have the same feeling, she'd not have accepted the flowers.

1435
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:33,720
But I saw it with my own eyes, she accepted them.

1436
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,640
Well then, I should get back to work.

1437
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,720
I have so much work to do.

1438
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,240
Bye.

1439
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,280
Good luck, Natheerin.

1440
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,680
- Yay, Kob! - Kang.

1441
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:12,680
I'm so happy for you that this day has finally come.

1442
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:16,120
I never thought you would finally make a move on her.

1443
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:19,200
- Come on. - My friend finally made a move on a girl he likes!

1444
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,720
Get down, Kung.

1445
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,320
You're awesome, Man.

1446
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,160
How many times are you going to talk about it?

1447
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,840
I'm just happy.

1448
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,800
I feel like a mom

1449
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,999
sending her baby to kindergarten.

1450
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,520
Wait, let me wipe my tears.

1451
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,680
Stop it. You're overacting.

1452
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,119
Don't be so happy just yet.

1453
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,480
The coast is not clear.

1454
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,560
TecTien is trying to block me.

1455
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:44,960
Why?

1456
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,600
I see. He's acting territorial, right

1457
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,720
I thought so.

1458
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,760
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

1459
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:53,960
Later then.

1460
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,400
Wait.

1461
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,360
Think about it.

1462
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:04,080
What would make a proud man like TecTien

1463
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,920
step aside for you?

1464
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,040
Oh.

1465
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,480
Oh.

1466
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:11,760
Oh.

1467
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,920
- Moei. - Moei.

1468
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,120
Hey, Thian.

1469
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,160
We're here.

1470
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,520
- What are you doing? - It's good you're here.

1471
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:39,680
Give her a training and finish it before lunch break.

1472
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,760
And if you still make mistakes,

1473
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:43,600
I'll give you a big punishment.

1474
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,200
- And each of you will get one, too. - What?

1475
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,760
But 10 times bigger.

1476
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,400
- What? - Take this.

1477
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,199
What's wrong with you? Why taking it out on us?

1478
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,240
He's right.

1479
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,520
Why?

1480
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,240
You can't do it?

1481
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,560
Yes, easy-peasy.

1482
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,920
- Come on, guys. - You'll give her this.

1483
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,080
What are you doing?

1484
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,080
- Hey. - Hey.

1485
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,840
Hey.

1486
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:26,960
Why are you here?

1487
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,360
I'd like to talk to you in private.

1488
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,319
Hey.

1489
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,320
Do we have to talk to anyone in private?

1490
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,680
Never ever.

1491
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,320
Hey, Tum.

1492
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,880
Are Kob and everyone upset because Thian sent them to clear the site?

1493
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,040
I have no idea.

1494
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,920
But all of a sudden,

1495
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,600
they were just heading there. Yeah.

1496
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,520
Wait. And...

1497
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,080
how do we stop them?

1498
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,600
This is about men's pride.

1499
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,440
Women like us should never get involved.

1500
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,920
We should stay away, really.

1501
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,200
Hey, wait.

1502
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:17,760
Do you know what Kob was challenging Thian to?

1503
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,880
It's men and their pride.

1504
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,160
There's only one thing.

1505
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,200
It's a fistfight for sure.

1506
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,880
Man-to-man.

1507
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,440
I'm sure.

1508
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,680
A fistfight?

1509
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:04,280
Are you challenging me?

1510
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,440
Yes.

1511
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,120
And if I win,

1512
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,280
you have to let me pursue Moei.

1513
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,960
Or are you afraid of losing?

1514
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,760
Okay.

1515
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,760
I accept the challenge.

1516
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:39,880
"Cha-nor a-go chit-teh", Boss.

1517
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:42,960
Just be careful, Boss.

1518
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,520
"Mingalaba".

1519
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,720
Am I pretty?

1520
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:51,400
Like a fish hit the edge while escaping.

1521
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,360
- Wish for what? - Come on.

1522
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,919
Let's make a wish.

1523
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,520
I'll only wish for love.
