"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,165
(Two years ago)

3
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,287
"25s 2138"

4
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,622
It's 25S 2138

5
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,585
It's 25S 2138

6
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,296
I need to call the first aid

7
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,592
Where did I put my phone?

8
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,795
Wife

9
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,549
Are you injured? Where was injured?

10
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,643
Let's go in first, okay?

11
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,062
Be careful

12
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,732
First aid phone number

13
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,276
That student

14
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,489
Wife Are you okay?

15
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,865
How are you? Hey wife

16
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,575
Please let me...

17
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:40,952
(first aid)

18
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,879
Don't cry, it's okay

19
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,639
I heard that the boy arrived at the hospital

20
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,183
Then he died

21
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,687
From the perspective of blood coagulation

22
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,314
He should have been left there for about an hour

23
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,691
(defendant)

24
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,150
They say if treatment is timely

25
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,903
He could have survived

26
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,616
My wife said it was her fault and she always blamed herself

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,744
She said it was her damn sick person

28
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:23,870
I did see

29
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:24,830
(Criminal Division 1 Team)

30
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,124
License plate number is 25S 2138

31
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,710
There is no surveillance nearby

32
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,128
（25s 2138）

33
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,713
Only my wife's testimony

34
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,755
are you sure?

35
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:35,924
I'm sure

36
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,719
My wife is determined to catch the perpetrator

37
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,346
Every time she wakes up, she will recall the scenes at that time

38
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,515
- and record it in detail
-It's 25...

39
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,975
She insisted on taking medicine on time

40
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,729
Keep your mind clear as much as you can

41
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,939
Just to be clear when testifying in court

42
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,823
It is precisely because of her efforts...

43
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,203
That person will be arrested

44
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,207
witness

45
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,586
You just need to follow the lawyer's question and recall slowly

46
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,212
Just state it truthfully

47
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,840
(witness)

48
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,842
We've seen it many times

49
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,220
I introduce myself every time
What's my name?

50
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,976
That doesn't matter

51
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,269
My name is Yoon Seok-hoon

52
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,484
You said you witnessed a hit-and-run
Write down the license plate number immediately?

53
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,029
yes

54
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,406
Since you can see clearly

55
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,326
Why didn’t you call the first aid number?

56
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,703
-I…
-if you

57
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,039
Make a call now

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,791
Is it possible for the victim to survive?

59
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,876
-be opposed to
-Retract the question

60
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,170
I wanted to call...

61
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,630
What's my name?

62
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,840
I'll ask you what my name is

63
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,887
I just said that you forgot?

64
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,602
Please answer the question Witness

65
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,360
The victim is a middle school student

66
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,362
I heard

67
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,323
Before you get Alzheimer's disease
He is a junior high school teacher, right?

68
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,158
right

69
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,869
So you are based on the victim's school uniform

70
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,206
Even though it is far away
I also recognized him as a junior high school student, right?

71
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,542
right

72
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,836
A teacher who cares about students so much

73
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,505
Watching the student be hit by a car, blood flowing

74
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,715
How could it be possible not to call the emergency number?

75
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,176
that

76
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,972
-I…
-You forgot to call, right?

77
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,558
Just like you forgot my name

78
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,023
You see the audience seats there

79
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,568
A boy in green clothes and sitting next to him

80
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,278
Are girls wearing gray clothes?

81
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,951
Do you know them?

82
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,578
I heard they

83
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,746
You are your favorite student when teaching

84
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,874
Yeah?

85
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,210
-Yes
-What are their names?

86
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,716
Have you forgotten?

87
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,682
I just said my name, you forgot

88
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,143
What is your favorite student named? You forgot it too

89
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,270
Even forgot to call the emergency number

90
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,147
Such severe dementia patients

91
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,690
How can his testimony be accepted?

92
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,861
They're leaving

93
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,535
In your first testimony

94
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,621
You once said: "The first perpetrator is the hit-and-runner

95
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,206
The second perpetrator is my disease”

96
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,791
The above is your original words

97
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,879
It shows that you are desperate for
Get rid of the guilt of the second harm

98
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,466
Therefore, strongly requested
Lock the identity of the first perpetrator as soon as possible

99
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,553
This obsession and the second perpetrator
That is, the superposition of dementia

100
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,889
Are new victims being created?

101
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,186
Have you ever thought that dementia might be cheating on you?

102
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,827
Chapter 7: Love is unrestrained

103
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,123
The following is a notice on the performance compensation system

104
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,083
(Incentive salary)

105
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,168
This is the performance compensation system to be implemented

106
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,173
(A consultant and former lawyer
Fixed salary will be cancelled gradually)

107
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,468
I firmly oppose

108
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,053
Me too

109
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,014
Representatives This is ridiculous

110
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,225
How long have you been in office

111
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,143
No consensus was reached
Just change the incentive system without authorization?

112
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,395
(Common agreement reached after discussion)

113
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,398
This system is not good for most partners

114
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,317
Do you think a consensus can be reached?

115
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,613
Did you know that you could not achieve this or did you make this decision?

116
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,157
So when will you have to wait?

117
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,702
The act of squeezing salary-giving lawyers by taking cases at low prices

118
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,412
When will we indulge ourselves?

119
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,957
The reason why agency fees are lowered
It's because you get business

120
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,793
Not by professional ability
Instead, rely on personal relationships with senior officials

121
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,004
Then throw all the practice to the salary lawyer

122
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,965
Do "karaoke marketing" by yourself
"Golf Marketing" does nothing

123
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:31,720
Has lost practice proficiency
Loss of ability and professional competitiveness again

124
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,015
There is nothing else to do except to fight a price war

125
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,017
That's why you're rushing to get business by low prices

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,644
You come to the law firm to check it out

127
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,273
Salary lawyers work all night
If you are sleepy, you will spread the newspaper and lie on the ground and take a nap

128
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,108
But even if they work so hard, they won't get recognition

129
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,110
Even if you do a job worth 100 million won

130
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,362
But the partner took the case at a low price
Agent fee is only 10 million won

131
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,364
Their performance will be underestimated and will eventually be paid off

132
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,700
Which salary attorney is willing to stay in such a law firm?

133
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,995
Oh, you became a partner

134
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,205
Let's start teaching us

135
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,125
Don’t even talk about superiors and subordinates here?

136
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,085
Representative of gold

137
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,962
Are you planning to look at it like this?

138
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,257
As a founding partner, you say something

139
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,341
Oops This...

140
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,844
Let's straighten out the position first

141
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,556
Attorney Quan Nayan is a managing partner
I'm the department head

142
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,561
Besides, the law firm is not an institution that governs the superiors and subordinates

143
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,438
We implement a partnership

144
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,190
You are a partner, too

145
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,358
So are you and I

146
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,737
Don't use age to suppress others. It's too petty

147
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,199
Since everyone makes a living by logic
Just follow the logic

148
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,329
Please continue

149
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,376
The second half of last year alone
How many excellent salary-applicant lawyers have resigned?

150
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,462
Those are young people

151
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,297
In order to pursue a balance between work and life
Leave by yourself

152
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,635
They're not leaving for pursuit
Work-life balance

153
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,430
It's a balance of wages. This is what they need.

154
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,684
The performance system of more work and more income has collapsed
They chose to leave

155
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,860
It seems there is nothing to say. End

156
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,655
As long as I am still a managing partner

157
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,074
Revised performance compensation system

158
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,283
Will execute

159
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,369
If there is any objection

160
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,871
Just change me and sit in this position

161
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,749
If there are no other topics, the meeting ends here

162
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,628
(Lu Lin)

163
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,010
The former lawyer just stood by and watched?

164
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:40,056
Yes, Lawyer Jin even stood on their side

165
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,015
Wait a moment

166
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,561
This could not have been thought of by Quan Nayeon alone

167
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,106
Although she has strong business skills
But political sensitivity is zero

168
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,899
Of course it was Yoon Seok-hoon's idea

169
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,442
yes

170
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,027
"Wage pay balance"?

171
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,282
When Kwon Na-yeon was excluded, he gathered his claws and made up his momentum

172
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,577
Later, he instigated those old guys
Let her come back as a management partner

173
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,204
What's next?

174
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,498
Do I want me to dig up some Yoon Seok-hoon’s black material?

175
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,667
That's a waste of time He has no black material

176
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,960
What if there is?

177
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,462
I've found someone to do it. Let's wait

178
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,756
As long as you dig deep enough

179
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,718
No matter how clean he is, he will always get a little dust.

180
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,491
Lawyer Yin

181
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,329
Come in first

182
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,303
Wait, isn’t that lawyer Xu Huizhen?

183
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,181
Good guy Yoon Seok-hoon has something

184
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,143
While pretending to be noble, I was with the one I had just been here for two years
Has the salary lawyer been involved?

185
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,354
Wait, what's going on?

186
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,439
Why Yoon Seok-hoon

187
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,525
Will you be with Lawyer Xu Huizhen?

188
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,655
In the middle of the night, a woman enters a man's house
What other reasons can be there?

189
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,907
According to internal sexual harassment prevention regulations

190
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,493
Partners should avoid having to payroll lawyers

191
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,869
Or the secretary develops a private relationship

192
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,914
Yoon Seok-hoon himself was the one who promoted this regulation.

193
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,332
As a result, he violated it himself

194
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,669
Who would follow such a hypocrite?

195
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,003
That's right

196
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,547
But this alone is not enough

197
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,926
Although there are relevant provisions in the internal regulations
But it is not a punitive provision

198
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,388
Violation of advice only is not enough to kill one blow

199
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,430
So…

200
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,558
Lawyer Jin Baoyun is currently acting

201
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,644
MGC Securities' Improper Sales Litigation Right?

202
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,437
-right
-Xu Huizhen

203
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,522
Is it a member of her team?

204
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,815
Yes

205
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,527
The other party is TS Insurance Company

206
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,655
TS insists that Yoon Seok-hoon is acting

207
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:05,201
We finally got the consent of MGC
Set up an information wall to be able to represent this case

208
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,495
Really? That…

209
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:09,998
That's right

210
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,209
"Yong Seok-hoon and a salary-applicant lawyer who has worked for two years

211
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,627
There is an inappropriate relationship

212
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,131
And instigated him to illegally obtain confidential information

213
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,510
This will harm the other party's interests
Go to win the lawsuit injustice”

214
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,178
Too perfect

215
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,057
"This act destroyed Lulin

216
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,269
The credibility of information isolation walls established for a long time

217
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,479
Let Lulin's reputation be ruined"

218
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,690
“Not only that

219
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,652
In the past, relying on the credibility of the Lulin Information Wall

220
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,487
Even if there is a conflict of interest

221
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,615
Lulin can still achieve both parties' agency through formal procedures

222
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,660
Now the trust collapses
Causes both agents to be unable to perform

223
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,538
This results in significant loss of profits”

224
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,791
Then these unfavorable confidential information

225
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,293
Who will pass it to Yoon Seok-hoon?

226
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,213
This guy is very alert

227
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,507
So, before he can find out

228
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,885
Have a drink

229
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,271
(Airport Railway)

230
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,230
Hello?

231
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,775
I see

232
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,445
I just finished Singapore
The International Arbitration Center's Arbitration Returns

233
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:25,990
Yes

234
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,077
As soon as I arrived at the office, I sent the documents

235
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,120
OK

236
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,461
Are you Mr. Huang Zhongxian?

237
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,421
We are police

238
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,131
What is wrong with me?

239
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,760
Mr. Huang Zhongxian

240
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,680
You were arrested for suspected helping Ms. Che Yingshun commit suicide

241
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,890
Please go back to the police station with us

242
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,895
Do you have to do this?

243
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,563
Yes

244
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:01,234
I'm sorry for your wife, though
But I'm just performing my duties

245
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,236
Say goodbye

246
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,911
You have the right to hire a lawyer and have the right to defend

247
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,496
Have the right to refuse to make statements that are unfavorable to oneself

248
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,165
You can also apply to the court for a legality review of the arrest

249
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,125
What's going on?

250
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,543
Who are you?

251
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,463
I'm a lawyer

252
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:24,841
Who are you…

253
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,261
His wife's younger brother was guilty of helping him for suicide

254
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,972
Criminal charges against Mr. Huang Zhongxian

255
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,433
Did his wife commit suicide?

256
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,852
Yes

257
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,105
Are you going together?

258
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,108
OK I'm willing to go together

259
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,401
I don't need a lawyer

260
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,280
You go

261
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,323
I confessed my guilt and surrendered the law

262
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:50,950
let's go

263
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,928
What did you say?

264
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,431
Absolutely not

265
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,641
I'm dead inside

266
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,227
Now it's just a soulless shell

267
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,438
Yingshun

268
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,356
Please

269
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,027
I promise I will do better. Please

270
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,447
I do this because I don't want to hurt you

271
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,284
I can jump down from a high building or cut my wrist

272
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,536
Can poison yourself

273
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,331
I don't care what method

274
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,917
But you have to deal with the matter

275
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,044
Witnessed me to leave like that

276
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,379
Do you think you can still live a normal life?

277
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,679
I still want to leave a good impression on you

278
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,684
I don't want you to see me in a mess

279
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,857
Even if it's death, I want to walk with peace and dignity

280
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,402
I want to look the best

281
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,406
Living in your memory

282
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,544
Euthanasia

283
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,964
It is legal in Switzerland

284
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,010
We went there for a great time
Then say goodbye

285
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,063
Euthanasia?

286
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,233
Yes, he is euthanizing his wife in Switzerland

287
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,818
Arrested after returning home

288
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,283
Where are you going?

289
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,577
I went to the detention center to meet Huang Zhongxian

290
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,162
Do you want to take this case?

291
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,206
He doesn't want an agent...

292
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:08,754
You go back

293
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,756
I've received your feelings

294
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,341
I think

295
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,053
That hit-and-run lawsuit

296
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,766
It has had a significant impact on your wife's decision

297
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,685
You know, come here again?

298
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,605
What should I do to make you feel better?

299
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,651
Forget it, the problem is not here

300
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,778
Then are you deliberately seeking punishment?

301
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,574
Why? Do you feel guilty?

302
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:41,996
Don't do this

303
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,458
Since you respect your wife's choice
Make that decision now

304
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,126
It's a betrayal of her choice

305
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,587
I was mentally prepared before making a decision

306
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,173
I'm willing to take it

307
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,261
All responsibilities for this decision without any complaints

308
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,224
(Lu Lin)

309
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,894
Case No. 248-13 Huang Zhongxian

310
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,605
The defendant's wife suffered from dementia during her lifetime

311
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,359
With the assistance of the defendant
Yu Switzerland ended his life through assisted suicide

312
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,528
The defendant has been filed with criminal charges by his wife

313
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,572
And was charged with suicide help

314
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,325
Have you read the case file?

315
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,576
- See
- See

316
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,536
South Korean criminal law not only applies to the principle of territoriality

317
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,829
It also applies to the human principle

318
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:24,830
Therefore, penalties can be imposed

319
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,250
But it is understood
Among those who died through assisted suicide in Switzerland

320
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,336
No fellow travelers have returned to Korea yet

321
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,962
Cases of prosecution

322
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,006
Although simple accompanying will not lead to prosecution

323
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,218
But in this case, the defendant was not just accompaniment

324
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,970
Instead, actively participate in and assist in the whole process
So prosecuted

325
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,139
According to the Supreme Court's jurisprudence

326
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,809
The scope of helping suicide includes
Provide suicide tools such as guns and knives

327
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,227
Or give advice or encouragement

328
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,729
Whether positive or negative
Material and spiritual help

329
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,398
These are all helpful behaviors

330
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:54,443
In view of the active participation of the defendant in this case
I'm afraid it's hard to avoid being prosecuted

331
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,486
What are the defense directions?

332
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,822
You can try to claim that the behavior is socially equivalent

333
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,283
An illegal reason

334
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:06,497
But there is an unfavorable factual factor in this claim

335
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,540
What is it?

336
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,459
After the wife dies, the husband can inherit the inheritance

337
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,712
-How many are there?
-About 1.7 billion won

338
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,588
Both have no children

339
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,174
After the wife dies, the husband will inherit all the inheritance

340
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,344
But if the husband is convicted
The inheritance rights will be deprived

341
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,888
The wife's younger brother will be inherited

342
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,308
This may be the reason why he filed a criminal charge

343
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,687
-This is very unfavorable
-And there are

344
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,398
Evidence of cheating

345
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,858
Infidelity?

346
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,110
Yes, it seems to be a recent event

347
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,862
Oh my God...

348
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:45,077
To comply with the reasons for illegal obstacles
Written written materials

349
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,036
-yes
-yes

350
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,584
(Court)

351
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,129
Prosecutor Please state the facts of public prosecution

352
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,048
Defendant on suspicion of being in Switzerland on May 11, 2025

353
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,176
To his spouse Che Yingshun

354
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,972
Get euthanasia medications through a doctor's prescription
And carry out the entire process of injection death

355
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,932
Proactive assistance provided

356
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,393
Article 252, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law is now

357
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,812
Suicide helps suspicion prosecute

358
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,107
Please clarify whether the facts of public prosecution are recognized

359
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,943
The defendant denied the facts of public prosecution

360
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,989
Please tell me if you are a witness before your sister died

361
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,409
What is the relationship with the defendant?

362
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,119
Bad relationship

363
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,664
My sister is in pain because of her brother-in-law cheating

364
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,376
He also asked for divorce and live with his lover

365
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,836
That's when

366
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,174
My sister was diagnosed with dementia
I think my brother-in-law is for this reason

367
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,760
Retracted divorce application

368
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,930
My sister is weak and can't live long

369
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,724
He must have withdrawn his application because he knew

370
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,101
If my sister dies
As a husband, he can inherit the inheritance

371
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,145
Oppose This is a speculative statement

372
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,064
What I'm talking about is the fact

373
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,858
That guy just wants to inherit my sister's legacy

374
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,319
Then I stayed with my lover and flew.

375
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,240
My poor sister couldn't live for a few years

376
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,909
But he can't even wait for that little time

377
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,036
So he encouraged my sister

378
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,206
Destroy her will
Force her to commit suicide under the name of euthanasia

379
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,625
Presiding Judge Please stop witnesses

380
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,753
Things that are not personal experiences
Testimonies about expressing other people's opinions

381
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,466
Witness Please restrain yourself

382
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,718
Do you have an extramarital affair?

383
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,596
have

384
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,140
When does the time span come from when?

385
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:35,187
It started a year before my wife was diagnosed

386
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,108
After the diagnosis, I broke up with the other party

387
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,237
Have you ever filed a divorce with your wife?

388
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,782
Yes, on the day I filed for divorce

389
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,078
She said she was diagnosed with dementia

390
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,790
That moment was like a blow

391
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:58,002
Completely caught me off guard

392
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,211
(Diagnosis)

393
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,421
Is it true?

394
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,548
It may be a misdiagnosis

395
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,259
Have you visited other hospitals?

396
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,761
With my personality, can I not go?

397
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,306
But how...

398
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,142
You are only in your 40s, why is this happening?

399
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,643
OK

400
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,437
Let's get divorced

401
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,399
-What are you doing now if you are divorced?
-You said you wanted to get a divorce

402
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,151
I did not mean that…

403
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,654
Did you feel pity for me when I was sick?

404
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,825
Wife, let's focus on treating the disease first

405
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,410
Medicine is so advanced now...

406
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,745
I'll take good care of myself

407
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,624
Take out the divorce agreement, I'll sign it

408
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,544
(Early signs of impaired memory in dementia)

409
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,971
Husband, what are you doing here?

410
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,697
sorry

411
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,907
What?

412
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,493
You can say this is an excuse

413
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,703
But I think about it carefully

414
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,416
You're like that because you're sick

415
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,129
But I'm narrow-minded and misunderstood you

416
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,968
Misunderstandings accumulate a little bit, so I feel cold

417
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,388
What are you talking about?

418
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,474
You've always been a promise

419
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,310
But I always forget my promise

420
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,604
You never spoke loudly to me before

421
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,232
But he started yelling at me

422
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,151
I'm talking to you and you don't care.

423
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,320
Become very impatient

424
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,199
I don't know it's because you're sick

425
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,743
Also use loneliness as an excuse to cheat

426
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,539
If I

427
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,792
Be more careful

428
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,503
Maybe we can find out early and go to the treatment early

429
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,922
But I just know how to run out...

430
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,723
come over

431
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,584
What are you doing here?

432
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,297
When did you come to Yingzhen?

433
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,466
What?

434
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,053
It seems that your brother-in-law will not go home today

435
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,597
He will come back

436
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,391
He will come back to me

437
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,312
Because I am his only home

438
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,116
I'm out

439
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,911
Wouldn't you kiss me today?

440
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,746
What?

441
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,832
We've been married less than a year
Is the honeymoon period over?

442
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:25,959
Come on

443
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,840
My wife's time has gone back

444
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,052
Not all bad things

445
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,138
What's it like when we first get married

446
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,225
How did she think of me then

447
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,268
I've remembered it all

448
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,067
I felt love before she got sick

449
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,737
It's just a single and superficial feeling

450
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,322
but

451
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,701
After feeling the time goes back with your wife
I've realized one thing

452
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,884
Love is a rainbow

453
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,931
Love is the light reflected by thousands of emotions

454
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,268
Red is passion

455
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,020
Orange is warm

456
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,273
Yellow is joy

457
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,733
Green is tranquility

458
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:36,530
Blue is trust Indigo is deep

459
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,700
Purple is a mystery

460
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,997
I believe our love begins with red

461
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:50,043
As the years pass, it becomes a different color

462
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,839
Changes in color does not mean that it is not love

463
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,216
But I didn't understand this at the time

464
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,010
We're from red

465
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,096
Going towards a person who can feel each other's warmth and satisfaction

466
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,390
Warm orange

467
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:08,812
Colors keep changing but the light is always brilliant

468
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,815
But I'm the only one...

469
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,863
I thought love disappeared

470
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,033
When you assist your wife in committing suicide

471
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,620
Do you still love her?

472
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,624
Yes

473
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,751
I love her

474
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,673
It's because of loving her

475
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,554
I will respect her decision

476
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,062
According to witness testimony

477
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,441
The defendant is indeed actively assisting
Ms. Che Yingshun committed suicide

478
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:58,153
In the name of euthanasia, the reality of helping suicide

479
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,447
This behavior is in full compliance

480
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,783
Article 252, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code
The constituent elements of suicide assistance

481
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,534
Must be punished according to law

482
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,496
Recently admitted to active euthanasia

483
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,916
Assisting Dignity Death Act
Submitted to the Legislature

484
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,002
Then when I express my intention to be euthanized

485
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,546
We should not ignore its will

486
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,924
It should be from the maximum
Start with respectful point of view

487
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,177
Family assistance behavior

488
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,305
It is in compliance with Article 20 of the Criminal Law
Socially equivalent behavior

489
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:29,226
The illegality of suicide assistance should be prevented

490
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,812
Please ask the court to convict the defendant

491
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,481
presiding judge

492
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,068
In this case, the parties
Prescription medications by injecting them on your own

493
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,655
Implement active euthanasia

494
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,657
And not to avoid physical pain

495
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,827
It's to escape dementia
This neuropsychiatric disorder

496
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,539
Because my wife suffers from dementia
Help her husband euthanize him

497
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,625
How can he determine his behavior
What about not violate social equivalent?

498
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:57,087
Presiding Judge The pain of dementia

499
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,131
No less than physical pain

500
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,550
Especially like Ms. Che

501
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,386
Always deeply loved by students

502
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,179
And the people around you respect

503
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:09,891
Her pain must be even more unbearable

504
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,728
Prosecutors only acknowledge physical pain

505
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,106
But the position of indifference to mental pain

506
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,109
Not only is it extremely one-sided, but it deviates from the spirit of the times

507
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:23,113
In addition, the defendant is Ms. Che's
First ranking legal heir

508
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,491
And there are cheating during the marriage

509
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:30,787
His motive for helping his wife commit suicide
Have obvious interest correlation

510
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,957
The so-called inheritance of the prosecution
The accusation of helping suicide

511
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:38,003
It is a subjective conjecture without evidence

512
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,755
In addition, the defendant's extramarital affair

513
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,382
There is nothing to do with this case on the timeline

514
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,426
Please ask the court to take full consideration

515
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,469
OK

516
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,263
This court has fully listened to the opinions of both parties

517
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,099
Prosecutor Please make a sentencing recommendation

518
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,978
Requests the court to sentence the defendant to three years in prison

519
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,817
(Present-in-Course)

520
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:04,279
The defendant's alleged circumstances

521
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,616
This court believes
The defendant is out of sincere love for his wife

522
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:12,079
Make a decision to help commit suicide

523
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,665
However, if you are sympathetic to personal situations

524
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,460
Apply the law according to the circumstances

525
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,963
This will eventually damage

526
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,801
Fairness and justice in the overall society

527
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,303
Therefore, the defendant should be equally applicable

528
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,181
Provisions of the law

529
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,185
According to the current Criminal Law
Even if the other party's request exists

530
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:40,399
Helping others commit suicide is not tolerated

531
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,275
The judgment is as follows

532
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,654
Defendant sentenced to one year in prison

533
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:29,990
Yanya

534
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,244
You know I like you very much, right?

535
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:36,997
that…

536
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,085
I'm ready

537
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:43,795
I understand your feelings

538
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,299
But you can't come to me like this anymore

539
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:02,772
Let's get divorced

540
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,232
Why do you want this?

541
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,526
I don't love you anymore

542
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,779
No throbbing, no heartbeat

543
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,366
I don't feel anything about you anymore

544
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,368
Do you think this is a reason for divorce?

545
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,829
We haven't been intimate for over a year

546
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,707
That's because you've been busy too

547
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,084
You always keep your distance so I...

548
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,880
I thought we just needed time

549
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,924
If it's because of this, I can work hard

550
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,175
I can't live like this

551
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,594
This boring and loveless day

552
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,055
I can't get through anymore

553
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,226
Did you see me that night?

554
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,102
I've seen you too

555
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,566
You obviously saw that man hugging me

556
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,944
But just turned around and walked away

557
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,113
I don't want to blame others' unrequited love on your head

558
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,366
You don't have to feel guilty

559
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,742
I trust you

560
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,786
I didn't do anything that I had a conscience

561
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,120
I have no feelings for him

562
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,289
-I know
-but…

563
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,460
But I didn't reject him either

564
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:11,424
Seeing him is like seeing you ten years ago

565
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,262
The passion in his eyes when he looked at me...

566
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,183
Just like you ten years ago I miss

567
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,394
Love is not just passion

568
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,106
Let's go through the storm together
The stability established is also love

569
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:32,195
But this feeling of burnout
Every day, I'm gnawing on me little by little

570
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:35,156
The relationship I had when we were together did disappear

571
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,034
But replaced by new emotions

572
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,289
We became the closest people of our family

573
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,710
People who want to rely on and trust this is also love

574
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,174
During this time, I will go back to my parents' house first

575
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,885
Yanya

576
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,977
It's me

577
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,564
Can you meet now?

578
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,906
What happened?

579
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,206
After we divorce
This is the first time you have contacted me on your own initiative

580
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,626
Is something wrong?

581
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,546
today…

582
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:37,594
A wife who helps dementia
The husband who was euthanized said this

583
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,305
He said love is like a rainbow

584
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,810
Love is not just red

585
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,106
He said the love between husband and wife...

586
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,903
It just changed color as time goes by

587
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,323
And the color change...

588
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,993
It doesn't mean it's not love

589
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,244
I know

590
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,330
I know I was wrong before

591
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,208
-You know?
-Um

592
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,586
I understand now

593
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,048
Sorry, I haven't realized it yet when I'm by your side

594
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:19,219
I only realized after being with Yuanjun

595
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,389
I was still very confused about love at that time

596
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm too immature, that's what I'm like

597
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,826
You don't have to make perfume and soap for me anymore

598
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,120
As for hashing

599
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,205
Please send it to the daycare center on time

600
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,041
Don't arrive early, don't arrive late

601
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,045
We won't meet again in the future

602
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,425
Xixun

603
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,799
here

604
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,011
Can't you eat alone?

605
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,097
I'm at work, you still make so many calls

606
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,266
Don't you have something to say to me

607
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,893
-Yeah?
-yes

608
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,145
No

609
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,397
It's your life story that I don't know

610
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,317
Forget it

611
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,277
Have a bottle of soju and a bottle of beer

612
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,529
- Come now
-You want to drink

613
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,032
-I'm so hungry
-Yeah?

614
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,992
-Wait a minute, it will be fine soon
-I want to eat roasted pork skin first

615
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,452
OK, eat roasted pork skin first. Understand

616
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,788
Almost good

617
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,749
cheers

618
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,670
Ah, why not tell me?

619
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,298
What do you want me to say?

620
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,383
Another bottle of soju thanks

621
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,719
Stop ordering, you obviously have such a poor alcohol tolerance

622
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,347
I don't drink it, it's for you to drink it

623
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,848
I'm already drunk

624
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,058
You haven't

625
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,561
When you are drunk, the past will blurt out

626
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,606
I

627
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,150
Always very curious

628
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:45,740
What kind of experience was it
Xu Minzhen today

629
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,120
I always find it amazing

630
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,207
-What's magical?
-that is…

631
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,502
No matter what you do
You're very excited as if you were the first time

632
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,381
Like a teenage girl

633
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,300
What kind of law firm

634
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,678
Will a seminar be held in the amusement park?

635
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,891
Hello Xu Minzhen

636
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,893
So excited, hurry up and leave!

637
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,271
Only little girls wear this thing

638
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,730
-hurry up
- It's really crazy

639
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,078
Looks like you're excited
Like the first time I went to the amusement park

640
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:38,209
I can't help but wonder what life you lived before
Haven't even had such a simple happiness

641
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,886
It's indeed the first time

642
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:54,017
When I was in my 10s, I worked hard to study
Want to let mom live a good life in the future

643
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,644
In his 20s and 30s

644
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,897
Time has been stolen

645
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:03,192
When I was almost 40 years old
Fighting hard to live a new life

646
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,486
Just like this, I'm in my 40s and I've met you

647
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,364
Think about it carefully, I really appreciate you

648
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,909
There are some things I dare not try alone

649
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,119
I have experienced a lot of blessings

650
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,371
Thank you Zhenyu

651
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,833
What should I thank you?

652
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:24,297
I've played those countless times
Something that becomes tasteless at some point

653
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,424
When playing with you

654
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,135
Really happy

655
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,931
(Yong Seok-hoon Lawyer)

656
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,686
-It's Lawyer Yin
-Why did he call?

657
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,480
That's it

658
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,655
Come in quickly

659
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,614
elder brother!

660
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:52,867
Why are you still running?

661
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,078
This is the first time you said you miss me

662
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,037
I have to run over here

663
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,081
If there are wings, I'll fly over

664
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,541
I'm here too, I hope you don't mind

665
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,501
Of course I don't mind

666
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,837
-Are you drunk?
-not yet

667
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,465
I'm a little drunk.

668
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,759
Wait a moment

669
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,719
This is the first time you have a drink together?

670
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:15,515
Previous group dinner
You've never appeared together, right?

671
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,434
No, when I was a paralegal
Have dinner together often

672
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,645
Paralegal? when?

673
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,814
When I was in law school, I worked as a paralegal part-time

674
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,857
What? This is another past that I don’t know?

675
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:25,817
Yes

676
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,861
Hidden so deeply

677
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,781
No wonder you were so awesome in the first year of your job

678
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,701
Then you must know, brother?

679
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,661
Of course I know

680
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,621
He is a key figure in my past life

681
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,956
-Really fake?
-real

682
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,002
I can become a lawyer thanks to Lawyer Yin

683
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,420
What?

684
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,714
He sponsored me to study in law school

685
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,968
He pulled me out of the stinky ditch

686
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,804
My dad passed away early

687
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,307
My mother suffered a lot before she offered me a prestigious school

688
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:03,938
As a result, I just entered school and met a scumbag and had a child

689
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,816
I endured my husband and in-laws

690
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,028
Various verbal insults, contempts and contempts

691
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,281
But it completely defeated me

692
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,908
Even my daughter starts to look down on me

693
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,704
I want to take revenge

694
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,542
No, I should want to
Find someone to tell me your grievances

695
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,711
So I went to find a lawyer

696
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,796
It's lawyer Kim Rusung

697
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,591
The relationship between you two is very deep

698
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,678
It was also on that day
I met my noble man in life

699
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:39,432
Is your noble person in life Lawyer Jin?

700
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,184
no

701
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,478
It's the lawyer next to him

702
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,022
he?

703
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,527
You also know what kind of person Lawyer Jin is

704
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,197
I can't seem to afford the cost

705
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,531
He immediately pulled away

706
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,995
But after Lawyer Yin heard about my situation
Extend a helping hand to me

707
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,748
Then I said this to me who longed for revenge

708
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,001
Can I...

709
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,297
Can I pay the agency fee later?

710
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:21,933
For those living in stinky ditch
The best revenge

711
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,353
Just leave that place

712
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,691
If you need...

713
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,695
I'm willing to pull you out

714
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,372
-Isn't it super handsome?
- Very handsome

715
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,251
Thinking of that time
I still can't help crying

716
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,710
Lawyer Yin, have a drink

717
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,963
-cheers
-cheers

718
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,549
Cheers to the stinky ditch!

719
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,134
Where did you hear this?

720
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,829
It's worthy of being Lawyer Jiang

721
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,082
Written materials are absolutely brilliant

722
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,043
Fully qualified to join the team

723
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,964
You've been awarded

724
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,300
You taught it well

725
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,636
No, Lawyer Jiang, you are already great

726
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,430
That's why I call you Lawyer Jiang

727
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,390
Not Jiang Xiaomin

728
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,810
This is thanks to you

729
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,770
-How long will you play?
-I was scared!

730
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,065
Lawyer Yin

731
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,613
When did you start there?

732
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,656
From the beginning

733
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,451
What are you doing here so late?

734
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:08,706
I don't want to go home

735
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,126
What's wrong? Is there anything wrong at home?

736
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,922
No, it's because nothing happened

737
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,345
Do you want a cup of tea?

738
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,063
Are you worried?

739
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,902
It might be a little better to say it

740
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:39,904
I've been the last time

741
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,657
I'll be much better after talking to you about my mom

742
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,163
It's hard to explain

743
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,456
No?

744
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:54,669
You are a language master
What is there to be nothing that cannot be explained?

745
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,171
You've always been my audience

746
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,548
Actually, I'm a good listener, too

747
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,592
Give me a chance

748
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,393
My ex-wife and I...

749
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,815
Have been in love for three years and divorced after seven years of marriage

750
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,152
She remarries a few years later

751
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,613
I'm still pregnant now

752
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,498
When I was in my first year of high school

753
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,876
A classmate is a pathological liar

754
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,087
I'm very good at identifying people

755
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,132
So he can't deceive me

756
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,010
Anyway, he didn't cause any big trouble, I'll let him go

757
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,137
But one day

758
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,889
He messed with me

759
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,309
Can see through people's hearts...

760
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,563
Of course, I also know the other party's biggest weakness

761
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,481
Once it doesn't suit your wishes

762
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,235
You can hit the key points without mercy

763
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,154
so…

764
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,157
I did that then

765
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,601
That day...

766
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,023
I realized
What a sharp tool language can be

767
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,443
I've become less talkative because of this.

768
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,613
But I'm not that to my ex-wife

769
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,949
We talk about life...

770
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,286
Share your feelings

771
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,746
sometimes…

772
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,749
Say some boring little things too

773
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,252
Emotionally, I let it go after the divorce

774
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,506
But I feel that she is now and she is in the past...

775
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,385
It seems like two completely different people

776
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,388
It's easy for me to let go of her now

777
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:11,972
But I can't let go...

778
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,059
She's in the past

779
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,397
I miss the time I talked to her so much

780
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,692
I often talk to myself as if she was right in front of me

781
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,277
Like a madman

782
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:31,700
But today...

783
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:36,997
I feel like she was the past...

784
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,086
It also disappeared like a bubble

785
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,591
After letting go of everything

786
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,845
The original location became empty

787
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,680
So I feel empty, right?

788
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,184
Maybe

789
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,105
Are your home big?

790
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,901
Because the house is too big, your heart is empty again
Don't want to go back to the empty house

791
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,361
That's why I came here?

792
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,657
Maybe

793
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,744
The only irreplaceable in this world

794
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,038
Only yourself

795
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:23,544
Even the person who was in the past can be replaced after all

796
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,297
Really?

797
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:28,048
real

798
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,676
That feeling of emptiness will soon disappear

799
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,013
You may not believe it, but time will heal everything

800
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:38,100
It is said that emotions cannot resist the erosion of time

801
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:41,729
And time has crushed the past into dust

802
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:44,857
This sentence is very good

803
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,030
I have to go for a walk and sober up and drink.

804
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,032
OK

805
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,826
Lawyer Jiang Xiaomin

806
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,495
yes

807
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,708
Thank you

808
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,376
You're welcome

809
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,797
Lawyer Yin

810
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,552
See you tomorrow

811
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,222
OK See you tomorrow

812
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,196
- Look at your slippers are pretty well-dressed
-My slippers...

813
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,698
Go quickly

814
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,326
I said I could go home by myself

815
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,787
Why are you so exaggerating?

816
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,499
exaggerate? Please let me repay my kindness

817
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,627
You used to send me home

818
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,006
OK, go back soon

819
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,259
Goodbye Thank you Zhenyu

820
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:54,927
where you go?

821
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,389
Wait a moment!

822
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,100
I've seen nothing

823
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:09,900
Headache

824
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,658
Scare me

825
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,785
What's going on with you? Why haven't you left yet?

826
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,329
Do you know how late it is now?
How can I drive me away?

827
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,290
I'll sleep on the sofa for one night

828
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,584
-Hello!
-My home is very far away from here

829
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,168
I'm a little drunk, too

830
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,754
What if I fall asleep in a taxi?

831
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,799
Nowadays, men are not safe to walk at night

832
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,718
OK

833
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,262
You'll do whatever you want

834
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,182
Oh my God, it's so cold

835
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,312
I'm almost frozen to death. Your house is too cold.

836
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,106
Very cold...

837
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,316
-Oh my God...
-for you

838
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:53,694
Thanks

839
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,195
-I'm going to sleep
-Thanks

840
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,364
Good night

841
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,662
So soft

842
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:35,653
Mother

843
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,238
Get up? Go and wash up

844
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,324
When did you come?

845
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,160
It's soy soup!

846
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,829
I've always wanted to eat the soy soup you made

847
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,498
-Yeah?
-Um

848
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,668
Did the boy who slept here last night leave?

849
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,048
It seems yes, I should have breakfast before leaving

850
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,009
Mom, have I told you Zhenyu?

851
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,761
He is a salary attorney My colleague...

852
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,554
Go and wash quickly

853
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,848
OK I'll go right now

854
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,142
Let me smell you more

855
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:10,521
-Ouch
-very nice

856
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,817
Really

857
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:20,364
You're 20 years old
Why are you still acting like a child?

858
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,784
What is 20 years old?
Don't you know how old your daughter is?

859
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,412
I'm 42 years old

860
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,838
yes

861
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,967
I'm 42 years old

862
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,053
And mom...

863
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,850
I died when I was 23 years old

864
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:51,854
Mother

865
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,152
So is this a dream?

866
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:01,655
Mother

867
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,535
Is this really just a dream?

868
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,829
Mother

869
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,832
Is this just a dream?

870
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,251
Mother

871
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,004
Mother

872
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,047
Mother

873
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,675
Mother

874
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,595
Mother

875
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,679
Mother

876
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,933
Mother

877
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,427
Sister, what's wrong with you?

878
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,638
What's wrong?

879
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,556
What's wrong? How are you?

880
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,142
What's wrong? What's going on?

881
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,772
Who asked you to enter my room casually?

882
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,566
That because you're crying...

883
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,362
-How are you?
-Go to sleep

884
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,280
Do I want me to stay with you?

885
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,991
-What?
-Do you want me to sleep with you?

886
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,326
Are you kidding?

887
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,497
I promise to only sleep and not do anything else

888
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,582
Go out soon

889
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:39,169
I feel a little uncomfortable when you cry

890
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,630
I am the one who cries, why are you feeling uncomfortable?

891
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,132
I don't know, maybe...

892
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,470
Seeing a person who is usually very strong crying so sadly

893
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,973
I'm a little uncomfortable

894
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,853
Alas, I'm so annoying

895
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,563
Really

896
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:00,232
Oh my God

00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,489
Isn’t this the other party’s confidential information?

910
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,494
Could it be a document for Jin Baoyun's lawyer team?
Was it sent to us by mistake?

911
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,580
impossible

912
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,916
-Please
-That's going to be serious

913
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,751
We have set up an information wall

914
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,421
Yes, how could it be here with us?

915
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,424
Wait for a moment What is this number?

916
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,220
It seems and provided to
Our client's information is different

917
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,973
There are differences in sensitivity analysis

918
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,099
Oh my God

919
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:22,064
In the internal report of the defendant MGC Securities
Contains different analytical conclusions

920
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,273
Yes

921
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,525
Defendant judges the key investment risks of fund investment

922
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,236
Whether the principal and income can be recovered upon maturity

923
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,155
This is largely
Affected by the spark price spread of power plants

924
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,907
(Spark spread: core income indicator of power plant)

925
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,535
So they did an internal review
Decide not to invest with your own funds

926
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,287
But the plaintiff's funds invested

927
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,582
If the defendant knew that the investment risk existed

928
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,501
But deliberately concealed...

929
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,877
Main position litigation request

930
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,089
It can be determined as fraud or major misunderstanding
Requesting to cancel the investment contract

931
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,007
You can also add fraudulent and inappropriate transactions

932
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:52,260
Reservation claim
It can be considered as a violation of investor protection obligations

933
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,222
Violating investor protection obligations alone is difficult to win

934
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,348
But with this data

935
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,059
Even if the fraud claims are rejected
We still have a big chance of winning

936
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:03,271
But such a confidential document

937
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,565
How does it appear in our file stack?

938
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,276
Do I want me to check where it leaked?

939
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,320
No

940
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,366
But still confirm...

941
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,785
Include internal review reports in written materials

942
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,162
Internal circulation after revising the lawsuit request

943
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,999
But keep the client and external personnel confidential

944
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,126
Lawyer Yin

945
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:27,295
This way, use the other party's confidential information
It doesn't seem to be suitable

946
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,797
In the event of a conflict of interest…

947
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,298
Modify written materials

948
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,134
-yes
-Understood

949
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,885
Go out

950
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,531
Damn it

951
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:55,991
(Kid Construction Shuyun Bank)

952
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,123
(TS Insurance MGC Securities)

953
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,545
(Complaint)

954
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,259
(Plaintiff: TS Insurance Company)

955
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,344
(Yong Xixun, Xu Minzhen, Li Zhenyu, Kang Hyomin)

956
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:19,765
(Prepare a letter)

957
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,434
Beautiful work
Your partner assessment is next year, right?

958
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,393
Yes

959
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:27,064
-I will do my best
-very good

960
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,732
You can leave first, we also want to...

961
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,609
OK Goodbye

962
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,028
OK

963
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,071
OK

964
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,949
Look

965
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,744
Yoon Seok-hoon is even more innocent than I thought

966
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,329
He shouldn't have been hooked so easily

967
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,790
That guy is too competitive

968
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,291
I knew he would take the bait right away

969
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:47,459
-Yeah?
-Yes

970
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,294
So should I hold a partnership meeting now?

971
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,171
I think it can

972
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,672
Wait for us to get rid of Yoon Seok-hoon

973
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,716
We must also remove all his subordinates

974
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,928
Especially the new female lawyer
It looks particularly annoying

975
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,263
-who?
-The lawyer named Jiang Xiaomin

976
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,807
First place in the School of Law of Seoul University?

977
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,103
Who cares if she is the number one?
Just a wild horse that broke the reins

978
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,897
Are you so excited because of a newcomer?

979
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,859
To be honest, you are very strict with female salary lawyers

980
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,779
Is it better than creating emotional entanglements?

981
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,280
That's right

982
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:20,659
The only thing I don't worry about is the male and female issues

983
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,618
You know?

984
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:22,911
Know…

985
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:26,581
But you're better to others. Don't be too harsh

986
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:29,918
You don't know this?

987
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,380
Ask Xu Minzhen to come out immediately!

988
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,216
You need to make an appointment first

989
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,384
Xu Minzhen!

990
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,511
-mom…
- Come out now!

991
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,887
let's go

992
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,473
She and I divorced seven years ago
Why are you still here?

993
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:48,770
Good guy

994
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,565
I really didn't expect

995
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,317
You're a complete transformation

996
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:55,652
What are you asking me for?

997
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,530
I haven't seen my mother-in-law for so long. What's your attitude?

998
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,700
Mother-in-law? Who are you talking about?

999
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:06,329
Look at this uncultured girl
How did you talk to me

1000
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,039
Ask again What do you want to do with me?

1001
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:12,210
This is not convenient to talk about

1002
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,380
Find a place to sit down and talk

1003
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,673
Just say it here

1004
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,803
I mean

1005
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,847
If it is said publicly here

1006
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,349
You may be embarrassed

1007
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,227
Not embarrassed at all, please say

1008
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,857
You have become a lawyer, why don’t you tell us?

1009
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,027
Did you come for this?

1010
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,403
That little girl without background

1011
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:42,574
Try to collude with you and want to destroy our family

1012
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,242
You two disasters

1013
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,493
I don't understand what you're talking about

1014
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:46,786
My wife said...

1015
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,207
She wants to entrust you to file a divorce lawsuit

1016
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,501
Yes, she came to me and I refused

1017
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:57,631
We paid you the university tuition and living expenses back then

1018
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,133
You have to return it all

1019
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:04,554
Thanks to us, you finished college
Going to law school and becoming a lawyer

1020
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,182
You have to repay us, right?

1021
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:11,770
I heard you're bankrupt
So are you here to beg?

1022
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:16,107
-I…
-How dare you talk nonsense!

1023
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,194
You're so stinky...

1024
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,364
-You hit me?
-Oh my God

1025
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,740
Hello!

1026
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,159
She must be crazy

1027
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,328
-Please call the security guard
-OK

1028
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,956
- Call the police
-OK

1029
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:35,877
roll

1030
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,171
Avoid suffering more

1031
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,130
Hello!

1032
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,716
You're just a damn orphan

1033
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,511
Seduce my bright future son and get pregnant before marriage!

1034
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:48,139
We kindly take you in
You just repay your kindness with grudges?

1035
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,268
Oh my God!

1036
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,395
Still the same thing

1037
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,939
Are you still laughing? You're so stinky...

1038
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,858
How do you manage the building?

1039
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,861
Letting such idle people come in to hinder work

1040
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,655
So what's the use of security guards?

1041
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,782
What? "Idle staff"?

1042
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,033
sorry

1043
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,244
-Turn them out
-OK

1044
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:10,870
This way

1045
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,539
Why haven't the police come yet?

1046
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,124
Do I want me to hit again?

1047
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,875
OK, just sue them for obstructing business

1048
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,920
Let me go! I can leave myself!

1049
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,090
Do you want money?

1050
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:24,467
It was my mom who provided me with the university

1051
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,178
You only paid one year's tuition fee at most

1052
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,638
"living expenses"?

1053
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:32,517
For 14 years, you forced me to do housework
Just let me sleep for 5 hours a day

1054
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,894
Should I also ask for compensation?

1055
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:38,398
If you dare to come to me again

1056
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,233
I'll make you pay a heavy price

1057
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,177
-How are you?
-What's the meaning?

1058
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,596
Just had an argument with your ex-husband

1059
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,014
Why am I not good?

1060
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,557
You're really cool

1061
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,270
-Are there any plans today?
-What's wrong?

1062
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,521
Do you want to have supper together?

1063
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:19,898
I'm controlling my diet

1064
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,317
oh? So, I want to lose weight, too

1065
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,652
There is a good salad shop nearby
Do you want to eat salad?

1066
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,279
Don't go

1067
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,865
We used to go

1068
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,825
-The Blood Sausage Soup Hotel...
-No

1069
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,500
Why do you always waste time on me?

1070
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,542
What?

1071
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,379
Are you not planning to get married?
Do you have no time to spend?

1072
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,255
What's the point of having a meal with me?

1073
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,342
Go to fall in love. If not, go to date

1074
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,845
Why spend precious time
Wasted on having a meal with me?

1075
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,219
It's really heartbreaking

1076
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,597
What sad dreams have you had?

1077
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:50,572
Hello

1078
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,950
Did I wake you up?

1079
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:56,911
Go outside to sleep

1080
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,249
-Why?
- Go to sleep on the sofa

1081
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,293
The sofa is a little...

1082
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,252
Go out soon

1083
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,088
hurry up

1084
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:10,717
Really

1085
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,386
Bring the door on

1086
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,138
It's really too much

1087
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:20,977
OK

1088
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,396
Good night

1089
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:37,076
Why did you hold this emergency partnership meeting?

1090
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,329
Why are there special requests

1091
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:42,123
Exclude a partner?

1092
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,416
That's right

1093
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,752
The partner who was asked to be excluded

1094
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,504
It's the topic of today's meeting

1095
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,672
Is lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon the issue?

1096
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:51,466
That's right

1097
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,260
Someone is anonymous...

1098
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,599
Send this photo to my office

1099
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,895
Do you recognize the people in the photo?

1100
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,065
The photo shows lawyer Xu Huizhen

1101
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:11,152
Entering the residence of lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon late at night

1102
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,487
Oh my God

1103
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,614
Just based on the photos of her entering Lawyer Yin's house

1104
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,450
The relationship between the two cannot be determined

1105
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:20,370
Even if they are dating, what's the problem?

1106
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,122
He violated the policies he had formulated

1107
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,667
Is this too hypocritical?

1108
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,382
Although it is inappropriate to talk about Lawyer Yin’s private affairs like this?

1109
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,093
But I remember he's divorced
This is not an extramarital affair

1110
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,095
As for the big fight?

1111
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,180
Lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon

1112
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:42,392
Severely damaged
Ethical Principles and Integrity of Our Organization

1113
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:44,852
What does this mean?

1114
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,897
He has an inappropriate relationship with a junior lawyer

1115
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:49,941
And attempt to illegally obtain...

1116
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,529
The other party's confidential documents

1117
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,738
To be used

1118
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,074
His behavior shakes the law firm

1119
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,285
Information isolation wall built by trust for a long time

1120
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:04,664
Our moral principles and integrity foundation
He will ruin it like this

1121
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,671
What are you doing?

1122
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,980
"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

1123
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,107
Big news Super exciting

1124
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,275
-He resigned
-What?

1125
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,486
-I won't explain
-This is too messy

1126
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,112
I really thought it would be better to die than to stop

1127
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:19,989
But I decided to give you a try.

1128
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,282
Really?

1129
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:24,410
What's going on now? Let's explain

1130
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,370
elder sister!

1131
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,373
We have all the evidence
And she was arrested on the spot

1132
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:29,332
Always feel something is wrong

1133
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,376
It seems that your next goal is Jiang Xiaomin

1134
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:33,294
Don't want to be crushed, just crawl away

1135
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:36,881
For me
Justice is to protect the person I must protect

1136
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,758
Even if it is illegal?

1137
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,013
