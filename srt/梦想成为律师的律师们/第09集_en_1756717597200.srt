"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

2
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,874
do you remember?

3
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,210
Of course she remembers
How could I forget what happened when I was eight years old?

4
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,920
But she was young at that time and might not remember it.

5
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,385
Because I don't remember

6
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,932
gentlemen!

7
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,810
Is there a doctor on the plane?

8
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,104
-Is there a doctor?
-I am a doctor

9
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,940
-Who are you…
-Can you help?

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,359
Together one, two, three

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,153
Turn him over and let him lie on his back

12
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,414
-He is simply worse than a beast
-Kim Byung-soo on suspicion of kidnapping

13
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,624
and sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl

14
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,126
Arrested in Silver City

15
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,422
It is reported that the victimized child suffered
Severe physical harm that endangers life

16
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,341
And huge mental trauma

17
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,468
Kim Byung-soo argued that he was drunk when he committed the crime

18
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,054
In a weak state

19
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,307
(April 2015)

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,516
Please give

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,602
(Entry of Emergency Center)

22
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,491
What's going on? What is her name?

23
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,577
Jin Minsheng is seven years old

24
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,370
Sensitivity rate

25
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,331
Can you hear it? Sensitivity?

26
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:20,390
Why did you wake up? Does it hurt very much?

27
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,225
Do you feel okay?

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,436
It's fine

29
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,898
Don't worry I'll be here forever sleep

30
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,653
Good baby sleep

31
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,697
(May 2020)

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,325
Is it a stabbed patient?

33
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,215
I refuse to treat him

34
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,468
Now transfer to another hospital
It takes 40 minutes on the road

35
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,511
This increases the risk of death in patients

36
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,138
-So what if you die?
-What did you say?

37
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,683
What's going on?

38
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,687
this…

39
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,690
As a doctor, how can you say this?

40
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,733
Do you know how many hospitals there are in Seoul?

41
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,736
You think I'm responsible for the allergy rate

42
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,280
What is the probability of meeting that guy?

43
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,409
This is God's will, let us not save him

44
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,160
The doctor's duty is to save lives and help the wounded

45
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,454
No right to decide who is qualified to survive

46
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,289
Not to kill him

47
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,500
Instead, let the destined death go with the flow

48
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,668
How can you...

49
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,087
As a doctor, how can you say this?

50
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,256
Haven't you seen Minsui look when he was sent?

51
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,677
I still remember the tragic situation of that day.

52
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,180
That miserable experience That cruel thing

53
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:46,017
It happened in
A seven-year-old child who has no ability to resist

54
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,897
If we save him
What should I do if there is another victim like sensitivity?

55
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,567
That guy will be out of jail in a few years

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,861
Have to live for decades

57
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,362
I don't care about those

58
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,656
Now I only see a critically ill

59
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,742
Let me save him

60
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,785
(Operating room)

61
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,249
doctor

62
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,710
doctor!

63
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,295
What's up? oh

64
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,598
The patient has heart tamper

65
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,058
Pericardial effusion causes heart pressure

66
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,602
First aid must be carried out immediately

67
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,605
Is there a pericardial needle in the first aid kit?

68
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,689
Please wait

69
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,900
Take off his top first

70
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,406
Give me the gloves

71
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,125
Give me the puncture needle

72
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,777
Damn it

73
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:31,998
Chapter 9: Qualifications for Survival

74
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:39,714
She killed my son
Are you going to let her get away with it?

75
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,551
(Criminal Section 2 Team)

76
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,552
I mean

77
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:48,139
The doctor killed someone
What is this not killing?

78
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,683
The police are only responsible for investigation

79
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,268
He was prosecuted for murder

80
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,354
Or prosecuted on other charges. This is decided by the prosecution

81
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,940
You can find a prosecutor in charge of the case

82
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,694
The doctor deliberately killed my husband

83
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,820
So let's ask you

84
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,823
Transfer our words to the prosecutor
Or other people with power

85
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,199
Put her in jail

86
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,450
That's what I mean

87
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,620
When my son was taken to the emergency room

88
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,331
I can hear that bitch clearly

89
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,543
She made it clear that she wanted my son to die

90
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,672
She kept a grudge last time

91
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,216
So this time when she saw my son on the plane

92
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,218
Just seize the opportunity and kill him

93
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,804
I can't believe it

94
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,142
How could they let the murderer come for first aid?

95
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,103
Oh my God

96
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,980
-How could it be so unlucky?
-Mother

97
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,608
Ouch Bingxiu

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,069
My poor Bingxiu

99
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,863
What?

100
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,741
Hello, come here

101
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,409
Come here, hurry up

102
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,494
No?

(June lawyer and secretary promotion announcement)

104
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,373
Dao Shengzhao?

105
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,668
Is Lulin's biggest salary thief going to be a partner?

106
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,087
This is too much

107
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,301
Salary attorneys on the list
Most are notorious salary thieves

108
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,345
I thought Lawyer Quan took office

109
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,764
How fair is the promotion system

110
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,432
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

111
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,977
Don't be impatient these people will leave soon

112
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:20,398
Even if you can stay
As a salary thief, the end of his life

113
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,567
(Representative lawyer Quan Nayeon)

114
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,902
Have you considered it?

115
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,739
Yes, I've considered it

116
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,994
But I still like my current job

117
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,246
I've experienced so many bad things in Lulin

118
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,624
Don't want to repeat the same mistake

119
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,917
You must know

120
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,087
Talents like you serve as legal affairs in medium-sized enterprises

121
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,713
Pure waste

122
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,256
What's important about that

123
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,133
Just feel comfortable

124
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,472
I can't promise anything else

125
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,100
But I can assure you a little

126
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,896
I will make Lulin a land of justice

127
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,607
My definition of justice is simple

128
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,151
It means that strength can be evaluated fairly

129
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,113
A system that achieves success with hard work and ability

130
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,535
You will be the biggest beneficiary in this system

131

Hey sister

133
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,017
By the way, I have something to do

134
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,688
What's wrong with her?

135
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,782
I'm very busy

136
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,202
Let's go for a meal

137
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,370
I've made arrangements

138
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,123
What are you looking at?

139
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,917
You go first, let's talk later

140
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,837

Legal Due Diligence Report Page 39

Regarding the execution of security rights of priority creditors
Is it causing a change in control?

144
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,351
We may need to re-check

145
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,604
That preferred loan...

Kim Byung-soo's wife and mother

147
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,192
Come to the hospital every day

148
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,360
Screaming at me and saying I'm a murderer

149
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,155
Even spitting in my face

150
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,160
What do they want?

151
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,828
What's this

152
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,331
It must be money

153
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,501
They also whispered

154
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,710
Criminal charges for murder

155
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,757
What if she was charged with murder?

156
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,760
Constituting a murder requires subjective intentional requirements

157
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,304
Are they claiming that you killed him on purpose?

158
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,556
It seems to be

159
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,475
Is there any reason for this?

160
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,812
years ago

161
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,650
Kim Byung-soo was stabbed while serving his sentence
Delivered to the emergency room

162
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,445
I refuse to treat him

163
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,658
It seems they heard what I said at that time

164
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,202
Things are not that simple

165
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,539
This bad fate is simply outrageous

166
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,917
My wife was the attending physician of the victim child

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,460
A few years later

168
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,296
Kim Byung-soo needs first aid

169
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,799
He was sent to the hospital where she is, right?

170
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,139
Then you met him again on the plane?

171
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,099
Yes

172
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,934
It's a bad fate

173
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:48,022
Do you remember what you said when you refused treatment?

174
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,858
then

175
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,529
I'm very excited and can't remember what I said in detail

176
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,325
But I seem to say
"He is not worthy of living, so let him die."

177
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,954
“Saving him may cause more children to be victimized”

178
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,831
That's probably what

179
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,294
But to be fair, I'm right

180
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,505
Although it was an attempt

181
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,049
But he attempted to kidnap an eight-year-old girl

182
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,759
Yes, yes

183
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,887
This has not been announced to the media yet

184
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,723
But the police received a report and are under investigation

185
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,853
However, after Kim Byung-soo's death, the investigation was over

186
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,564
Then he was taking the plane to...

187
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,942
Yes, he seems to be preparing to escape overseas

188
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,283
I want to ask you a question

189
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:41,910
What's the problem?

190
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,746
Did you intentionally kill Kim Byung-soo?

191
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,790
Lawyer Yin This question is a bit...

192
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:51,961
no

193
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,549
OK

194
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,179
Just follow a process and confirm it

195
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,180
I see

196
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,895
I was sitting there listening to my heart pounding

197
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,607
Please, of course it's not that she won't kill him on purpose

198
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,902
If you really want to kill Kim Byung-soo
She just won't help

199
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,445
Why pretend to save someone?

200
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,113
That's hard to say

201
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,408
Prosecutors may argue
Dr. Choi didn't know it was Kim Byung-soo at first

202
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,035
Just went to carry out first aid

203
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,413
But when he recognized him, he changed his mind

204
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,040
Not that

205
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,250
Even if Professor Cui said

206
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,835
Want to kill Kim Byung-soo is just an angry word

207
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,921
Want to kill someone and really fight

208
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,965
It's completely different

209
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,424
Yes

210
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,178
To be honest, if it were me

211
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,014
Maybe he would refuse to treat that beast

212
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,725
He doesn't deserve treatment

213
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,893
True or fake?

214
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,354
I thought you were highly medical ethics

215
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,106
What about the doctor who abides by Hippocratic oath

216
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,608
Yes you're right

217
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,779
"The value of life is not relative
But absolute

218
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,614
"Life should not be classified"

219
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,826
“All life should be treated equally”

220
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,785
But…

221
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,537
But?

222
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,080
I hope

223
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,794
Professor Cui was found guilty without condition

224
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,922
-I hope too
-I hope too

225
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,221
So this year's dad's birthday

226
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,099
I'm going to make some stewed pork ribs and bring them over

227
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,268
How much do you plan to do this time?

228
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,645
I'm nervous when you say you want to cook

229
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,356
That's so big

230
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,443
Our family has more than one hundred people

231
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,697
Where can I find a big family like us?

232
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,532
It's so embarrassing

233
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:48,619
This is a blessing. You don't know how to be blessed.

234
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,829
Why is the youngest so quiet?

235
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,372
I'm here I'm listening

236
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,582
By the way

237
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,917
Do you still remember my friend Guo Huijing?

238
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,171
I heard she is in a divorce lawsuit

239
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,714
Yes

240
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,716
Due to property division

241
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,218
She fought with the male lawyer

242
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:08,473
I heard that the man found a top divorce lawyer

243
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,516
But her lawyer seems to be a little bit off

244
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,977
So she asked me to ask my brother

245
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,731
After all, my brother's law firm is so famous

246
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,566
Can you take her case?

247
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,736
No, I'm too busy, let her find someone else

248
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,654
Why?

249
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,698
She is my good friend

250
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,700
I don't accept divorce cases

251
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,620
Usually my colleague, Lawyer Xu Minzhen, answered...

252
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,336
Then again, yes

253
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,421
-I answered
-Really?

254
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,050
Isn't she your good friend?
Of course I have to help with this

255
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,511
Give her my business card and ask her to go to the law firm to find me

256
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,262
Why did you suddenly change your attitude?

257
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,348
Since all that's all

258
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,142
Why don't you ask her if she will come tomorrow

259
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,727
-Will that work?
-Of course it's OK

260
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,855
-Very good
-Our baby has grown up

261
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,440
Please stop calling me baby

262
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,109
Our cute little baby

263
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,111
Absolutely no longer say "cute little baby"

264
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,030
(Lu Lin)

265
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,448
(Partner promotion ceremony)

266
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,077
-welcome
- Looking forward to working with you

267
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,043
- Let's work hard together
-I will devote my wholeheartedness to Lu Lin

268
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,884
- Looking forward to you achieving something
-Okay, I'll work hard

269
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,725
-Congratulations
-I will do my best

270
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,895
(Innovation drives integrity)

271
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,691
“The above-mentioned persons are appointed here
Be a partner of Lulin Law Firm”

272
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,067
"Lawyer Dao Shengzai"

273
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,698
Why are you feeling depressed all the time?

274
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,993
Two or three years ahead of most people
Unhappy to be a partner?

275
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,084
You signed the partnership agreement without even looking at it?

276
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,170
You know I hate to read contracts

277
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,005
I guess it's

278
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,969
We are in danger now

279
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,512
Not even a basic salary

280
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,556
What are you talking about?

281
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,393
After Quan Nayeon became a management partner

282
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,353
Completely reformed the salary system

283
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,022
All partners now

284
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,649
All are rewards based on the number of cases received and performance

285
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,193
No fixed salary

286
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,152
in addition

287
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,739
Whether the contract is renewed every year depends on performance

288
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,823
What?

289
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,535
If you continue to work like now

290
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,455
Starting next month
You won't even have a penny salary

291
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,583
Don't think about renewing the contract

292
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,542
What did you say?

293
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,005
This is too much

294
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,007
What exactly did we do wrong?

295
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,762
Does it mean you really have to stand by and watch?

296
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,641
We are Lulin, Lulin is us

297
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,977
Organizational reorganization? It sounds nice

298
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,397
But in fact, she is breaking up Lu Lin

299
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,608
Listen

300
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,694
I've resigned from my position as a managing partner

301
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,864
Now Kwon Nayeon is the management partner of Lu Lin

302
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,076
Do you really want to abandon us like this? Representative?

303
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,663
Abandon you? How can I say that?

304
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,540
Now I'm very depressed

305
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:24,001
But I've handed over the management to her

306
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,380
If I point fingers at her now, it will be overstepping my authority

307
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,924
What does that look like?

308
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,760
I mean even Kwon Nayeon

309
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,971
He will listen to your opinions

310
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,722
Why don't you talk to her privately...

311
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,184
OK, stop saying this

312
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,103
Why do you not understand politics so much?

313
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,147
Think about it carefully

314
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,608
Do you think Kwon Nayeon will listen to me?

315
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,364
OK I'll try to talk to her

316
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,366
But I can't guarantee the result

317
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,952
Thank you on behalf of us

318
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,746
Then we'll count on you

319
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,292
-good
-Please give me your request

320
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,502
OK Go back

321
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,968
Don’t you know what you did wrong?

322
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,391
Incompetence is the greatest sin

323
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,519
Hello

324
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,105
Is the structural adjustment almost completed?

325
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,400
OK

326
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,485
Let's start preparing now

327
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,529
Um

328
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,220
Kim Byung-soo's family strongly demands to be prosecuted for murder

329
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,973
Given that Dr. Choi refused to treat him
And her previous remarks

330
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,975
The prosecution is prosecuted for homicide

331
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,269
We should be before the prosecution filed a public prosecution

332
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,438
Submit an opinion letter to prevent murder charges

333
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,690
What about the crime of business negligence?

334
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,818
Because it was a death
I'm afraid this charge will be difficult to avoid

335
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,987
We must prove

336
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,449
Between first aid behavior and death results
There is no direct causal relationship

337
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,535
Have you found an expert witness?

338
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,372
Yes, we will meet with several doctors today

339
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,666
There will definitely be doctors with negative opinions

340
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,376
They will be based on the professional ethics of doctors

341
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,087
Questioning Dr. Choi Ji-soo's previous refusal to treat

342
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,005
And her related remarks

343
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,300
Opinions that may appear in favor of the prosecution

344
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,387
Therefore, as many expert opinions as possible must be obtained

345
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,846
clear

346
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:48,187
I have a pair of seven-year-old twin sisters

347
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,399
Our home is only ten minutes away from Kim Byung Soo's house

348
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,943
I want to join this case, too

349
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,611
-I…
-Me too!

350
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,739
These children

351
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,870
OK I agree

352
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,833
the truth

353
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,878
It will vary depending on the light projected
Take a different look

354
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,632
Lawyers are definitely not people who distort the truth

355
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,846
But for the client
The light holder who clears the fog of legal cognition

356
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,267
Prevent the rigidity and limitations of the law
Cover the truth with the wrong filter

357
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,317
-Thanks
-Thanks

358
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:42,950
Lawyer Yin

359
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,036
I plan to take a divorce case
The client is an acquaintance of mine

360
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,247
The divorce case was the responsibility of lawyer Xu Minzhen…

361
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,665
I hope to be a co-acting agent with her

362
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,959
If you work with Lawyer Xu

363
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,961
Considering the case-taking performance
It should be lawyer Kim Rusung...

364
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,088
Both hers' performance and execution performance are

365
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,506
I'll just work

366
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,551
Aren't you busy?

367
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,762
I'm busy

368
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,472
Then why still answer?

369
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,057
This is a good opportunity to accumulate practical experience

370
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,477
as you like

371
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,644
Thank you Lawyer Yin

372
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,774
I can finally take on the divorce case

373
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,569
Sorry I'm late

374
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,322
Not too late at all, we're here too early

375
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,326
This is our team's paralegal

376
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,787
In the recent Shanwei Enterprise M&A case led by you

377
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,873
He is the hero behind the scenes
I want to introduce it to you.

378
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,667
Sorry for not informing in advance
Do you mind him joining us?

379
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,044
Don't mind

380
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,797
Hello Representative Quan My name is Choi Yungen

381
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,801
It's my honor to see you

382
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,011
I'm glad to meet you, let's sit down?

383
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,054
OK

384
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,100
Choi Yungen is actually a lawyer

385
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,728
Yeah? Then why are you a paralegal?

386
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,650
To be honest, I graduated from
A law school at a local university

387
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,527
The results are not ideal

388
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,446
The bar exam score is not high

389
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,200
As a lawyer
I can't get into a top law firm like Lulin

390
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,410
That's it

391
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,455
But when he was asked to do things
I found his abilities were excellent

392
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,791
Nor are he very polite like those young people recently

393
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,043
And very cost-effective

394
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,796
Paralegal salary
Only one quarter of the salary lawyer

395
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,755
I see

396
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,799
Low-level employees like me

397
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,093
I never had the chance to see you

398
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,262
Can eat with you like now

399
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,514
It's a great honor for me

400
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,016
Thank you for saying that

401
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,188
Thank you for your hospitality Representative

402
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,067
I really hope there will be such a chance next time

403
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,862
I'm very happy too

404
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,073
But sorry, I have to leave first

405
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,283
fine

406
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,285
Let me pay

407
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,586
Sorry, sir, this card cannot be paid

408
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,673
What? This is impossible

409
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,136
You two go out first

410
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,888
What's wrong? Can't you swipe the card?

411
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,890
No

412
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,684
Don't worry, you guys go to the car and wait for me first

413
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,604
-I know, let's go
-good

414
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,192
Sorry, wait a moment, it's really weird

415
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,152
Representative Li!

416
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,949
Oh my God, it's lawyer Quan

417
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,038
So sorry

418
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,582
I will definitely pay you back today's money

419
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,709
It's OK

420
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,336
How are you doing recently?

421
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,713
I've always wanted to contact you

422
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,425
It seems you haven't heard of it yet

423
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,135
What's the meaning?

424
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,555
My company was taken away

425
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,933
Snatched away by Bluestone Fund

426
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,976
What? What's going on?

427
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,691
Can you tell me in detail?

428
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,903
You know, too

429
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,114
Hainiko Co., Ltd. is my lifelong hard work

430
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,866
NPU design algorithms and software platforms…

431
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,534
(Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Optimized Processor)

432
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,789
…It is the result of my research team’s efforts over the years

433
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,083
Yes, I know very well

434
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,295
It is based on this core technology
Many industry giants are trying to acquire your company

435
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,548
Yes, but it was sold in the end

436
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,760
Sold to large American companies Optalin

437
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,847
Didn’t you say you would definitely not sell it?

438
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:38,060
It's not what I sold, it's what Bluestone Fund

439
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,731
Bluestone Fund initially
Inject 15 billion won into our company

440
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,192
Then, on the grounds that I misappropriated my funds, etc.

441
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,986
Last year, it took over the entire company

442
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,990
Finally sold to Optalin for 120 billion won

443
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,077
They bought it for 15 billion
Selled the company for 120 billion

444
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,081
Just 120 billion won

445
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,085
Considering the potential of this technology

446
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,837
This price is simply a joke

447
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,382
Bluestone Fund is simply a modern version of traitors

448
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,385
For your own selfish interests
It actually uses the core technology developed by my country

449
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,554
Easily transferred to other countries

450
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,641
If we can persist in completing research and development

451
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,686
This technology could have been
New engine for South Korea's economic growth

452
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,649
So that's it

453
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,116
Representative Quan met with Lee Sung-bin yesterday?

454
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,492
knew

455
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,462
Lulin's client
It's Hainiko Co., Ltd. not Lee Sung-bin

456
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,131
Representative Li did not actually misappropriate the funds

457
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,841
-But for the company...
- Enough

458
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,010
You're not an amateur

459
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,012
Don't you know about this kind of legal consultation

460
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,764
Is it a direct violation of the Lawyer Law?

461
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,435
About this event I will convene a partner meeting

462
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,604
Please explain the situation at the meeting

463
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,022
-represent
-You go out

464
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,753
Hello

465
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,671
It seems that the plan has to be advanced

466
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,927
Don't we have a meeting?

467
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,596
-What meeting?
-Ms. Guo Huijing's divorce case

468
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,264
I'll handle it myself

469
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,350
Why?

470
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,269
What's the meaning? This is my job

471
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,437
This is my case

472
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,398
No one said you were responsible for this case

473
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,734
But I have to do the work myself

474
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:51,944
I'm going to do it, too

475
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,695
Have you handled a divorce case?

476
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,448
No, so I want to do it with you

477
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:57,950
You haven't done it, so I want to do it myself

478
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,034
Let's go together

479
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,121
-What's wrong with you?
-I want to ask you

480
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,413
What do you mean?

481
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,917
You don't talk to me, don't make an appointment
Don't drink alcohol or coffee

482
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,378
Now I don't even want to do my job together

483
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,381
Where did I make you angry?

484
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,967
-You don't
-What the hell is going on?

485
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:17,803
Let's stop doing this

486
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,181
Where are you going to take me?

487
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,684
What's going on with you?

488
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,394
I like you

489
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,770
What?

490
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:27,855
No

491
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,190
I love you

492
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,360
You must be crazy

493
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,528
Yes I'm crazy

494
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,280
Let go

495
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,824
-What do you want me to do?
-I said I love you

496
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:41,660
Are you feeling sorry for me?

497
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,036
Have you given me this opportunity?

498
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,248
-You heard about my past, that's what it is
-Yes

499
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,584
But I've loved you before that

500
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,751
I've loved you before

501
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,379
But I'm afraid of messing up our relationship
So I dare not express my feelings

502
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,631
But when I just like you

503
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,551
Become aware that everything still likes you
I'm sure of this relationship

504
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,929
I'm confessing now
It's because if you hold it on, you will get sick

505
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,890
Because I'm going crazy

506
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,560
Stop talking crazy

507
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,870
(Seoul Central Local Procuratorate Office)

508
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,954
(Prosecutor Quan Yuanxie)

509
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,873
How many years have you practiced?

510
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,999
I just entered the law firm for the first year

511
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,959
It turns out he's a rookie who's not dry

512
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,961
It seems that your law firm is quite confident

513
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,880
Newcomers were sent to such an important meeting

514
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:39,218
A convenient question
What crime do you plan to prosecute?

515
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,429
Homicide

516
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:49,394
Indirect intentional homicide, business negligence to cause death

517
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:53,023
Violation of the Medical Law and Causing Death

518
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,026
All these are possible

519
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,656
We will submit a detailed submission

520
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,825
Please review it before deciding whether to sue

521
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,285
OK I will

522
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,621
When will the autopsy result come out?

523
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,582
Who knows
It will come out naturally when it's time to come out

524
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:16,630
I heard that the cause of death was aortic dissection

525
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,301
Some underlying disease was also discovered

526
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,512
- So
-Wait a moment

527
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,681
I wrote down my name before

(Vascular Elles-Danglos Syndrome)

530
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,313
I heard it's a genetic disease

531
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,692
It is said to lead to life-threatening complications

532
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,027
For example, aorta rupture

533
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,406
It seems that he is destined to die no matter what.

534
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,410
If so
Choi Ji-soo has no responsibility

535
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,453
Not eligible for prosecution

536
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,748
Family history required for genetic diseases

537
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,709
Have you retrieved relevant medical records?

538
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,170
What if I retrieved it?

539
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,634
Can we apply for a review?

540
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,305
Otherwise, we need it
Apply for a court order to obtain hospital records

541
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,349
But even if there is a court order

00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,608
Whether to disclose materials before prosecution
It's within the discretion of the prosecution. You know?

545
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,985
Know

546
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,154
We'll be really grateful

547
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,866
I'll consider it

548
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,785
thank you

(The characteristics of Elles-Danglos syndrome)

550
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,968
(May lead to sudden death)

551
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,305
(Elles-Danglos syndrome has a high mortality rate)

552
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,057
(Complications include aortic dissection)

(Quan Yuanxie Prosecutor)

554
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,273
I really don't understand him

555
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,941
What was he thinking?

556
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:04,905
It really won't work

557
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,782
We only have limited abilities

558
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,742
That's it

559
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,328
If this continues, we will almost become doctors

560
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,122
Read too many medical books

561
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,707
I feel dizzy and nauseous

562
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,546
If so...

563
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,474
Who is this person?

564
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,935
This is my best friend and roommate

565
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,311
She's also a doctor

566
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,526
The autopsy is underway

567
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:46,154
But the prosecutor mentioned
Kim Byung-soo may be an aortic dissection

568
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,531
Really?

569
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,742
Professor Choi Ji-soo judged that it was heart tamponade

570
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,577
So I tried pericarpination

571
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,539
That's right, based on the medical information we've found

572
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,334
Pericardium puncture
Can be fatal to patients with aortic dissection

573
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,087
Yes, it's possible

574
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:07,592
If the autopsy results show death because of aortic dissection

575
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,220
We'll be in a very passive situation

576
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,764
I see

577
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:16,852
So what's important is
It must be proved that Kim Byung-soo himself suffers from it

578
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,437
A basic disease with high mortality

579
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,564
Although I'm not sure about the prosecutor's intention

580
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,648
But he revealed

581
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,318
Found during an autopsy
Vascular Elles-Danglos Syndrome

582
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,988
Vascular Elles-Danglos Syndrome?

583
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,240
-This is a genetic disease
-Yes

584
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,701
So we need to investigate his family history

585
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,703
But now we have obtained other people's hospital diagnosis and treatment records

586
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,829
Very difficult

587
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,166
Even if there is a court order
Our hospital refused to cooperate

588
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,793
Look, I've figured out a way

589
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,545
Um? How did it be done?

590
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,673
Let me tell you back and see what you wrote above

591
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,886
Kim Byung-soo's uncle
Died from aortic rupture in his 40s

592
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,555
His grandmother died of similar diseases

593
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:55,891
(Previous medical history)

594
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,310
Aortic rupture

595
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,686
Intestinal perforation

596
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,732
Based on the symptoms listed above

597
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,902
His uncle and grandma suffer from it
Vascular Elles-Danglos Syndrome

598
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,907
Finally there

599
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,467
But it's not coffee

600
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,135
Thanks

601
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:37,724
(Coffee Candy)

602
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:43,980
Very delicious

603
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:47,150
Right? The perfect alternative to coffee

604
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,902
Yes, that's great

605
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,197
I feel more energetic now

606
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,349
-What's wrong?
- Found

607
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,350
What have you found?

608
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,477
It's a medical paper

609
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,230
Essay-Danglos syndrome
Relevance with aortic dissection

610
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,193
(Elles-Danglos Syndrome
Concurrent spontaneous renal artery dissection)

611
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,369
Now you just need to organize it into written materials

612
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,414
Let's take some fresh air first. How about it?

613
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,583
Good idea

614
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,917
I know a great place

615
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,210
where?

616
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,295
Let's go

617
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,342
The view is amazing

618
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,177
- Very beautiful, right?
-Yes

619
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,972
I didn't expect that there was still such a place hidden in the office building

620
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,143
You said you have a pair of twin sisters?

621
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,436
Yes

622
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,397
Seven years old?

623
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,356
Yes

624
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,358
You have a big age difference

625
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,944
Your parents must have a good relationship

626
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,074
We don't have parents

627
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,459
My mom was in her teenage years
I was pregnant before marriage

628
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,546
She disappeared when I was in high school

629
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,132
A few years later

630
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,302
Leave a half-sister and leave again

631
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,973
Then you must have suffered a lot

632
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,353
Seven-year-old kids still need care

633
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,272
My aunt lives nearby and has helped a lot

634
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,526
But they usually go to and from school by themselves

635
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,404
I was very anxious when I heard that Kim Byung-soo was released from prison

636
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,618
I was relieved after I learned that he was dead

637
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,331
I was relieved because of the death of someone else

638
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,000
That's his own bad consequences

639
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,088
Do you know?

640
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,298
I'm a twin too

641
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,260
Really? I thought you were the only girl

642
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,221
We have some secrets at home

643
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,889
I thought you were from a perfect elite family

644
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,308
Haven't experienced any suffering

645
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,769
Every family has a difficult sutra

646
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,231
It is said that life is a tragedy

647
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,942
It's a comedy from afar

648
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,907
Topics to talk to friends while drinking at night

649
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,077
It's great early in the morning
Have a chat with my colleague while drinking coffee

650
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,578
Isn't it just right?

651
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,206
Yes, too

652
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,291
Then let's make friends with coffee?

653
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,127
This is the best thing I've heard today

654
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,095
Let's go back and finish that opinion book?

655
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,680
OK Go to work

656
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,889
Let's go

657
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,113
So you want to emphasize vascular type
The fatality of Elles-Danglos syndrome

658
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,158
and high mortality rates of aortic dissection

659
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,910
Blame Kim Byung-soo's death on underlying diseases

660
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,746
Thus, it proves in pathology

661
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,165
Between first aid and death

662
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,084
There is no direct causal relationship, right?

663
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,627
Yes, yes

664
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,421
Based on the information we collect

665
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,340
We plan to formally entrust
Pathology experts issue expert opinion

666
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,760
Patients with aortic dissection

667
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,803
Symptoms of heart tumour may also occur

668
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,305
But in the cabin

669
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,390
In fact, it is impossible to distinguish between these two situations

670
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,933
There were no diagnostic equipment at that time

671
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,895
There is no sufficient time to evaluate the patient's status

672
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,898
not to mention
In the case of high similarity in the two symptoms

673
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,816
Vascular Elles-Danglos Syndrome

674
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,402
As a genetic disease, family history needs to be checked

675
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,905
Ask about daily symptoms in detail and observe them for a long time

676
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,406
Only then can the diagnosis be confirmed

677
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,451
Under limited conditions
Find out all this in just a few minutes

678
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,328
No doctor can do it

679
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,498
Standards for judging medical negligence

680
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,835
See other doctors
How to make decisions under the same circumstances

681
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,838
If an emergency medical expert can issue an opinion

682
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,299
Prove this restricted environment in the cabin
Under time and information conditions

683
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,843
Choi Ji-soo's first aid measures are the best judgment

684
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,386
It can increase the possibility of innocence

685
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,013
I see

686
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,642
but…

687
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:36,064
If Dr. Choi Jisoo
Do you know Kim Byung-soo’s underlying diseases?

688
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,984
If she knew...

689
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:42,946
If she did know

690
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,990
Then her medical judgment may be interpreted as

691
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,536
Not simply a medical option in a restricted environment

692
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,871
Instead, it ignores important information

693
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,499
Or intentionally ignore

694
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,336
Especially, knowing pericardium puncture

695
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,297
Can be fatal to patients with aortic dissection
Still insisting on operating

696
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,299
Then she was charged with death by business negligence

697
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,426
The possibility of prosecution will increase

698
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,054
If there is still intentional suspicion on this basis

699
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,598
Maybe even charged with homicide

700
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,350
at present

701
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,187
There is no evidence
Dr. Choi knows Kim Byung-soo's underlying diseases

702
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,319
Do you have any concerns?

703
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,534
Is what Kim Byung-soo's wife and mother said true?

704
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,370
Did you intentionally kill Kim Byung-soo?

705
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,583
no

706
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,420
Nothing, just follow the previous discussion

707
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,257
Attached expert opinion and pathological analysis information

708
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,135
Completed submission to the prosecutor

709
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,511
-yes
-yes

710
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,014
(Lilsim Hotel)

711
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,558
Thank you for taking the time to come

712
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,978
Maybe it's too late

713
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,731
But I still want to figure out why I am

714
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,816
How did you lose your company

715
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,818
You must be very sad

716
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,237
but

717
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,532
How did you get investment in Bluestone?

718
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,368
That's it...

00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:47,487
This requires the acquisition of Hainiko Co., Ltd.

727
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,990
and transfer all the proprietary technology to

728
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,784
Our holding entity in the United States

729
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,411
Wait, are they proposing absorption mergers?

730
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,082
Then this is not an investment at all. It's about stealing technology.

731
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,753
Our goal is to fully develop this technology

732
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:07,966
Jean Heiniko Co., Ltd.
Further development and final listing

733
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,594
We cannot accept these conditions

734
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,098
I understand

735
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,100
Thank you for taking the time

736
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,769
Unfortunately, we can't continue talking

737
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,437
goodbye

738
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,608
I knew it would be like this

739
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,485
All investment proposals so far

740
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,154
All include the conditions for acquisition and technology transfer

741
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,949
That way
We can only choose equity pledge loans

742
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,492
This option doesn't work

743
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,120
If you accidentally default on your debt

744
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,623
The pledged equity will be executed
The company may be taken away by others

745
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,582
He's right

746
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,378
We have to find it
Investors with equity pledge conditions

747
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,762
Although I grew up abroad

748
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,890
But this kind of drinks still makes me feel uncomfortable

749
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,561
Of course that's right

750
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,273
Introduce yourself

751
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,735
I am Ban Ki-sen, the representative of Bluestone Fund

752
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,904
OK Lucky I am Li Chengbin

753
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,531
Hello

754
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,746
-Let's have a drink
-good

755
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,164
Really?

756
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,708
There are no equity pledge terms in your investment conditions?

757
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,460
That's right

758
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,171
Bluestone Fund

759
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,258
It is a company that supports outstanding technical strength
SMEs and startups

760
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,259
Investment Trust established

761
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,388
In short, we trust the value of technology

762
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,140
Unsecured loan support

763
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,937
It is not convenient to discuss details here
Why not talk to our company

764
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,274
OK I'll go

765
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,611
At that time, we urgently needed R&D funds

766
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,280
Yes, I remember

767
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,283
So when you use your personal funds to advance payment

768
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,993
In the process of recovering some funds

769
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:02,789
Due to incomplete legal procedures
It was eventually considered misappropriation of funds

770
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,333
Representative of the Rights of the At that time

771
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,170
I would like to provide legal advice
Help you avoid the crime of misappropriation of funds

772
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,963
She was demoted

773
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:12,673
etc.

774
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,259
Did you get demoted because of this?

775
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,595
Yes

776
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,306
In your contract with Bluestone Fund

777
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,309
There must be poison pill terms hidden

778
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,353
Turn me away

779
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,272
Just to stop me
Legal advice on that clause

780
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,191
Yes, very likely

781
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,569
She was in charge of Heniko Co., Ltd. at the time

782
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,197
But overnight
Her permission to obtain all information was revoked

783
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,157
And transferred from this case

784
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,244
This and Bluestone will come to you
The loan proposal time is exactly the same

785
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:45,706
All the clues are now linked

786
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,292
Have you brought a contract with Bluestone?

787
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,418
Bringed

788
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,214
Give

789
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,757
I'll check it out carefully

790
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,811
Hello?

791
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,648
Yes, it's me, is there anything wrong?

792
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,359
What?

793
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,404
Someone used my name?

794
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,491
OK I'll go here

795
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,119
What happened?

796
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,497
Police say someone pretended to be a scam

797
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,541
I'm asked to be questioned as a witness

798
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,542
-What?
-What?

799
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,043
Oh my God

800
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,046
Dr. Cui this afternoon
Aren't you going to attend the prosecutor's investigation?

801
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,173
Yes

802
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,550
I might be late

803
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,802
So before departure, I will report to Lawyer Yin first

804
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,846
-Okay, go quickly
-OK

805
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,931
Hope it's not a big deal

806
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,482
Is the police still asking her?

807
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,236
Should we go to the police station?

808
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,071
She's just a witness

809
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,073
-Do you know something?
-I have no idea

810
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,911
You seem to know, you've been quite close recently

811
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,538
Is there anything we can help?

812
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,335
If you want to help, you have to know what's going on

813
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,005
I have to leave now

814
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:16,964
Where to go?

815
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:20,384
Dr. Cui was summoned by the prosecution today

816
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,720
That's right, the defense lawyer is here to accompany him

817
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,764
Yes

818
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,686
Is there any news from Lawyer Cui?

819
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,896
not yet

820
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,565
-Go to my car
-OK

821
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,946
You can't contact her, right?

822
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,622
I read the opinion book very detailed

823
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,749
Yes Thanks...

824
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,965
Dr. Choi Jisoo

825
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,509
Did you intentionally kill Kim Byung-soo?

826
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,096
no

827
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,431
OK

828
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,892
We will not prosecute for murder

829
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,478
What?

830
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,273
This is explained in detail in the opinion book

831
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,233
Yes

832
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,777
Because this guy is dead

833
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:24,532
We have considered
Public prosecution for business negligence to cause death

834
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,992
But autopsy results show

835
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,912
The cause of death is aortic dissection

836
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,373
vascular type Elles-Danglos syndrome

837
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,916
This underlying disease causes

838
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,836
We agree with this conclusion

839
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,047
The opinion book contains analysis of pathology expert reports

840
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,882
Yes, I've seen it

841
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:46,095
Comprehensive autopsy results and submissions

842
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,015
We recognize

843
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,559
No direct causal relationship between first aid measures and death results

844
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,065
Dr. Choi Jisoo

845
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,570
We decided not to prosecute this case

846
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,531
Really?

847
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:09,035
Yes, the investigation is over, you can leave

848
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,747
Thank you for coming today

849
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:14,874
Be careful on the way back

850
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,585
OK, thanks

851
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,931
Is it all over now?

852
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:32,683
Yes

853
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,561
The prosecution decided not to prosecute, so the case is over

854
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,730
Thank goodness

855
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,941
Thank you so much

856
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,735
Thank you for your hard work

857
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,738
Now you can rest assured. Have a good rest

858
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,407
OK, thanks

859
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,792
Prosecutors decide not to prosecute

860
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,879
Although we are in the opinion book
A lot of effort has been put into

861
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,757
But I didn't expect it would be the result

862
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,343
(Lawyer Cui Haoyan)

863
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,553
It's Lawyer Cui

864
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,097
Hello?

865
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:12,890
how's it going?

866
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,477
Really?

867
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,480
OK

868
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,982
It doesn't matter

869
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,152
Don't worry Goodbye

870
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:28,906
What did she say?

871
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,201
She is still being questioned, and it seems that something has been misunderstood

872
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:34,537
That's it

873
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,206
I have to go to Lawyer Cui's house

874
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,250
Why?

875
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,794
The children are on holiday, but my aunt is not here

876
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,421
They probably spent the whole day at home alone

877
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,133
Lawyer Cui said
Not sure if the sisters have a good meal

878
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,718
-She said the children were only seven years old?
-Yes

879
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:51,720
Where are their parents?

880
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,599
It seems that Lawyer Cui is taking care of them alone

881
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,310
She said that her aunt lives nearby and would help take care of her.

882
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,437
Tell me her address

883
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,314
Let me go here, I can take a taxi

884
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,901
They must be hungry and take my car
Don't let them wait too long

885
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,087
It should be coming soon

886
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:28,674
It's almost here, but I can only walk the steps

887
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,843
The car cannot drive in

888
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,889
OK, get off here, please wait for us nearby

889
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,140
Are you going too?

890
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,600
Yes

891
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,185
-You don't need to...
-Go away

892
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,373
Who is it?

893
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,667
I'm Choi Ho-yeon's...

894
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,337
I mean

895
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,714
I'm your sister's friend

896
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,800
Our sister has no friends

897
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,719
that

898
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,972
I'm your sister's work friend

899
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,391
She's not at home now

900
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,393
Don't tell her this

901
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:25,856
Didn't my sister say that, I can't say there are no adults at home

902
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:30,361
My sister just went out

903
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,613
But she's nearby

904
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,157
No, I'm here because

905
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,368
She said she would come back later

906
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,995
Let me take care of you

907
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,705
It was your sister who asked me to come

908
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,750
Please tell me the secret number

909
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,834
Chocolate Milk

910
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:48,921
What is that?

911
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,007
Lawyer Cui just told me

912
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,717
She said the kids might ask this

913
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,303
Chocolate Milk

914
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,103
Hello

915
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,648
Is he a friend of my sister?

916
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:09,817
no

917
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,527
He is not a friend

918
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,280
She is her boss at work

919
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:15,614
I see

920
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,617
It turns out you are that terrible uncle in charge

921
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,579
Who am I've never been fierce

922
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,125
What are your names?

923
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,085
My name is Choi Mi-yeon

924
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,588
-She is my sister
-Choi Ruiyeon

925
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,714
Have you had a meal?

926
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,049
Must be hungry, right?

927
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:35,134
What do you want to eat?

928
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,052
-Pizza
-Spicy fried rice cake

929
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,304
-fried chicken
-spaghetti

930
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,680
Grilled ribs

931
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,473
That won't work

932
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,518
My sister said that she can only be on the Mid-Autumn Festival every year

933
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,730
Take grilled ribs once

934
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,900
Then let's go out for dinner tonight

935
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:52,985
-good!
-good!

936
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,030
let's go

937
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,364
-Go away
-quick

938
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,464
This is a good restaurant

939
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,299
This restaurant tastes great

940
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,259
Is it tasty?

941
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,887
So delicious

942
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,599
Meiyan Ruiyan Eat more

943
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,812
What's wrong? Have something more

944
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,064
I'm full

945
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,024
What? Is this full?

946
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,823
I've finished eating, too

947
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,659
What's wrong? Have something more

948
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,118
No thanks

949
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,662
but

950
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,750
Can we take the rest of the fried pork chop home?

951
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,294
Why?

952
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,255
My sister also likes fried pork chops

953
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:59,843
When she came last time she wanted us to eat more

954
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,389
Deliberately pretending to have stomachache

955
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:07,518
Actually, I can tell she's pretending

956
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,354
But it's so delicious

957
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,940
I'll eat it all

958
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,153
You finish your own portion
Let's order another pack

959
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:20,656
-Is it really possible?
-certainly

960
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,200
I'll definitely be in the company
Buy a lot of delicious food for my sister

961
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,536
Wow, is it true?

962
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,246
-real
- Pull hook

963
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,622
I want to do it, too

964
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,249
Of course, pull hook

965
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,626
Hanging it on the hook and not changing for a hundred years

966
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,547
I really hope others can see this

967
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,258
Your eyes are so gentle that honey can be dripped

968
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,927
Such a warm side
How did it hide until now?

969
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,897
Put whatever you want in the shopping cart

970
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,321
For the children
Is it better to cook without cooking?

971
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,158
Yes, buy some side dishes

972
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,117
OK

973
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,754
Even if my sister is not around, you have to have a good meal

974
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:18,589
Do you know how to do this?

975
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,467
Heat it in the microwave for two minutes

976
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,135
Two servings are four minutes

977
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,555
That's right, you can eat it with side dishes

978
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,057
Even if it's troublesome, you have to divide the side dishes and eat them

979
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,058
-OK
-OK

980
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,437
Give

981
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,565
It seems that Lawyer Cui has to come back later

982
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,609
Yes

983
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,279
I have to leave and I'll give it to you if I'll coax them to sleep.

984
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,364
-OK
-I'm leaving

985
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,630
Be strong and optimistic to live a good life
Remember to listen to your sister

986
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,467
Don't leave

987
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,969
Stay for a while

988
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,681
Why not wait for them to fall asleep and you will leave

989
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,359
It seems that the kids have fallen in love with you

990
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,112
They lack care

991
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,284
Really like a little angel

992
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,039
The seven-year-old is still so young

993
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,960
Kim Byung-soo doesn't deserve forgiveness

994
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,129
Even if you die, you don't deserve it

995
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,011
The decision not to prosecute today

996
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,931
Although it was the result I expected

997
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,935
But we are ready for battle
Win before the fight started

998
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,187
Although it's very exciting

999
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,730
But this is so exciting

1000
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:02,442
But it's a bit boring

1001
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,572
Do you think Dr. Cui is lucky?

1002
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:10,909
Do you think this is luck?

1003
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,586
No

1004
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,171
I don't think it's luck

1005
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:29,052
Prosecutor
I'll assign Kim Byung-soo's case to you

1006
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,472
But he also handled Kim Byung-soo's child sexual assault case

1007
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:34,850
So what?

1008
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,435
Is there any problem?

1009
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,939
All those

1010
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,942
To prove Choi Jisoo's innocence
People who make small actions and choices

1011
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:45,944
All in a corner of my heart

1012
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,947
A trial on survival qualifications is quietly underway

1013
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,449
I'll handle this case

1014
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,577
How can I get the same prosecutor
Responsible for this case?

1015
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,079
This is ridiculous

1016
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,749
You guys are...

1017
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,210
-Precise
-Yes, just partial

1018
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,589
Prosecutors will not bring personal feelings to their case

1019
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,300
We only follow the law and principles

1020
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,512
Unbelievable, this prosecutor, you listen

1021
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,265
You're obviously standing on the side of that bitch

1022
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,434
Pay attention to your words

1023
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,977
If you want to be troll

1024
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,688
You have to see the occasion clearly and identify the object

1025
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,233
There is only one driving force for that secret judgment

1026
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,445
It is love for the victimized children

1027
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,782
She must be punished for murder

1028
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,992
OK I understand

1029
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:37,120
I think lawyer Kim Do-yeon is very suitable for this case

1030
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,956
I'll arrange your case for him

1031
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,708
He is very awesome, right?

1032
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,671
That love comes from the regret and responsibility of adults

1033
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:49,424
Because they failed to protect
Children who should have grown up in love and care

1034
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,301
That's a belated love

1035
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:55,305
I really didn't expect you to arrange for lawyer Jin to take the case

1036
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,225
He can't be lazy because he is incompetent
Just do nothing forever

1037
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,685
But what if he messed up?

1038
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,229
The deceased is Kim Byung-soo

1039
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:07,776
And the evildoers who destroy children
The rage aroused

1040
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,112
Dominate their judgment

1041
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,614
If you have a family history

1042
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,200
You can attribute the cause of death to a basic disease

1043
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,537
Whether Kim Byung-soo's death is accidental or intentional does not matter

1044
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,747
For them

1045
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:25,711
The only thing that matters
His existence puts scars on Minli

1046
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:26,753
(Forensic Center)

1047
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:31,883
I know we have to work hard to avoid unjust death

1048
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,094
But feel

1049
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,471
Seniors worked extra hard on this case

1050
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,766
Do you know who sent the autopsy?

1051
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,102
-have no idea
-It's Kim Byung-soo

1052
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,146
We have to work hard

1053
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:45,647
Yes, you have to work hard

1054
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:46,940
final

1055
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,151
This thought turned into

1056
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,486
The prayer of the person who took his life without guilt

1057
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:55,240
Does Dr. Choi also know about Kim Byung-soo’s underlying diseases?

1058
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,199
have no idea

1059
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,536
Dr. Cui refused to treat him at that time

1060
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,164
No chance to check Kim Byung-soo's condition

1061
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,624
Makes sense

1062
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,961
If she had checked it
Possible for business negligence to cause death

1063
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,964
Worst case may even be charged with homicide

1064
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:11,923
right

1065
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:17,054
Prosecutor and opposing lawyer

1066
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,681
Probably ask you the same question

1067
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:20,849
I'll remember

1068
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,559
OK

1069
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,853
-What?
-You didn't know at the time

1070
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,440
You didn't even have the chance to check Kim Byung-soo, right?

1071
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:33,070
If someone asks me, I'll answer

1072
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,154
Because this is the fact

1073
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,870
I have two daughters, too

1074
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,123
Five years ago I knew he had a basic disease

1075
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,833
But I didn't tell him

1076
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,671
Let him follow his own fate
Live as long as you can

1077
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,930
Whether to disclose materials before prosecution
It's within the discretion of the prosecution. You know?

1078
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:00,889
Know

1079
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,475
We'll be really grateful

1080
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:07,187
I'll consider it

1081
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,107
thank you

1082
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,487
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

1083
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,123
I didn't say I'd have to think about it for a long time

1084
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,917
The application process for review and copying. Do you know?

1085
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,754
Of course I know

1086
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:34,589
Submit the application today

1087
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:35,799
OK

1088
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,805
About Elles-Danglos Syndrome
That practical medical book

1089
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,558
Where is it?

1090
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,562
Here

1091
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,315
And his death...

1092
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,734
("Symptom-oriented vascular type"
Elles-Danglos Syndrome)

1093
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,821
...Instead, it brings a little justice to the world

1094
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,614
What do you think

1095
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,034
Do people really have the so-called qualifications to survive?

1096
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,536
I think there is

1097
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:08,206
Qualifications to survive

1098
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:13,295
Maybe it's like
Let's leave a mark on other people's lives

1099
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,047
If the mark left

1100
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,467
Only pain and despair

1101
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,972
People lose the qualification to survive

1102
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,308
When the ineligible person dies

1103
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,186
It's no longer a tragedy

1104
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,440
Just a fragment that maintains the balance of the world

1105
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,651
How twisted is his life

1106
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,236
It will make people

1107
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:43,366
Trying to find justice from his death?

1108
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:49,956
Xiaohan is standing on my side

1109
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,125
no

1110
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,336
Little Man

1111
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,464
Stand on my side

1112
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,055
Smiled again

1113
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,779
"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

1114
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,866
Lawyer Jiang Xiaomin is here

1115
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,702
Have we seen it before?

1116
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,161
I knew you wouldn't remember me

1117
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,538
Post-traumatic stress disorder?

1118
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,000
Because I suffered severe school violence

1119
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,335
But was this really planned by Representative Gao?

1120
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,462
He can't leave any evidence.

1121
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,881
I seem to have a way

1122
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:26,052
How dare you defend the murderer who killed my daughter?

1123
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,887
I'll do my best

1124
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,764
Now it's time to find a winning blow

1125
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:30,765
That's it

1126
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,063
