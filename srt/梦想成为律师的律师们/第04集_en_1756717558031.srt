"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

2
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,682
Chapter 4: Homomorphic Revenge Law

3
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,018
(Eye for eye for eye, tooth for tooth)

4
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,896
-nice shot!
-sharp!

5
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,856
Very in place!

6
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,316
Already beside the cave

7
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,442
nice shot!

8
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,360
- Really amazing
- Just attack the green directly

9
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,430
- Going to the hole
- Representative Cui

10
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,990
I'll just say it

11
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,867
Speaking

12
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,111
I like first in everything

13
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:00,203
certainly

14
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,166
That's why I worked with Lee Xu, the first Korean law firm

15
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,420
We Lu Lin really need to work hard. Representative Cui

16
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:13,216
I personally owe Gao Shengzhe a lot of favors

17
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,303
So I want to give you a chance this time

18
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,388
Thank you so much

19
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,348
We must do our best

20
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,766
Don't rush to thank me

21
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,144
What?

22
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,979
I have a condition

23
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,315
What…

24
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,526
I'm having some trouble

25
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,862
I need someone to help me with a private lawsuit

26
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,822
No problem, leave it to us

27
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:36,782
This is lawyer Hong Daoyun...

28
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,741
-no
-he…

29
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,827
The lawyer I want to find is another person

30
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,496
You want to find...

31
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,456
Lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon

32
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,295
Lawyer Yin’s performance is actually not very good…

33
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,674
I heard that he has a high winning rate and is clean and neat

34
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,092
Yes…

35
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,802
This is my condition

36
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,389
If Lawyer Yin takes over my private lawsuit

37
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,058
I'll take the Como Fund's
Special investment case for small modular reactors

38
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,268
Leave it to Lu Lin, not Li Xu

39
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,567
Please use it slowly.

40
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,237
Sorry, I'll go to the bathroom

41
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,615
- Please
-Please

42
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,952
Really deadly

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,953
What should we do?

44
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,622
Why did it have to be Yoon Seok-hoon?

45
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,832
He may not accept it

46
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,793
I must let him pick it up

47
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,754
Representative of the Litigation Group Director Kim Rusung

48
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,131
It's my dad's capable boss

49
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,424
Right Yes

50
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,301
That means he will stand on your side

51
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,344
That's right

52
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,514
Lawyer Yin may not listen to me

53
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,849
But he will definitely listen to Representative Kim

54
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,016
-Yeah?
-Yes

55
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,226
I think so

56
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,812
His teaching is Quan Nayeon and Quan Nayeon's teaching is Quan Nayeon's teaching is Quan Nayeon's teaching.

57
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,272
Isn't it the representative of Jin Lucheng

58
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,690
Really

59
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,443
Why is it because of Yin?

60
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,031
(Lu Lin)

61
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,620
Come in quickly

62
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,165
Have you heard of it?

63
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,417
Lawyer Gao Taixie

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,502
We have won the big client of Como Fund

65
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,004
Not finalized yet. Representative

66
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,799
We also need our excellent lawyer Yin to help

67
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,342
Only this can be done

68
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,554
This is Choi Cheolmin's representative

69
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,806
He is the founder and representative of the Como Foundation

70
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,687
This is the trump card of our litigation team. Attorney Yoon Seok-hoon

71
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,231
Recognize the name for a long time

72
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,692
I heard you are a very good lawyer

73
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,902
(Chemo Fund Cui Zhemin)

74
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,944
Thanks

75
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,906
but

76
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,618
The case of the Cuomo Fund should not be found in the litigation team

77
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,411
Isn’t the merger and acquisition group responsible?

78
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,579
right

79
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:51,833
A case for special investment in small modular reactors
The merger and acquisition team will be responsible

80
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,960
I'll call you here

81
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,880
It's because Representative Cui has a private lawsuit to deal with

82
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,300
Now the expert is here, please tell me

83
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,844
I want to tell someone that my reputation is damaged

84
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,430
Who are you going to sue?

85
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,723
My nanny

86
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,603
What is the reason for this?

87
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,231
this…

88
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,983
Please don't worry, but it's okay

89
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,780
She reported to the police that I abused my daughter

90
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,491
Even asked the media for leaks

91
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,537
Fortunately, someone around me helped me, but it didn't make a big deal.

92
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,414
But if I don't pursue it
I'm afraid she will cause more trouble

93
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,459
So you want to sue her?

94
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,544
I haven't thought about it yet

95
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,547
I hate the troubles of big fights

96
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,676
So it's better not to go to court
Instead, it is solved quietly in private

97
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,887
Whether it is a legal threat to put pressure on the law

98
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,557
There is always a similar solution, right?

99
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,768
What should she know about you
Only then dare to do that

100
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,436
She said she took a photo

101
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,189
-photo?
-right

102
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,357
Do you have it?

103
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,775
have

104
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,618
Oh my God

105
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,456
How did she...

106
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,416
I have no idea

107
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,086
Bruises and wounds can be easily forged with makeup

108
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,214
I'm very busy and don't have much time to spend with my daughter

109
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,302
But she is with my daughter every day
Can easily make up anything

110
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,721
A situation like this

111
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,557
The party that loses more often becomes the weaker party

112
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,642
Once the media publishes a wrong report

113
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,312
The truth is no longer important

114
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,814
If the company's image is damaged

115
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,775
It's not just me that affects investors

116
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,527
I have to handle it with caution

117
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,613
certainly

118
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:48,700
This is really a disaster

119
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,077
I thought about using money to make her stop

120
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,123
I'm afraid someone will use it to make a piece
Instead, it seems that I have admitted something in disguise

121
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,626
Can't take this risk

122
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,924
I heard about the Como Fund
There are big names among actual investors

123
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,384
There are many celebrities in the political circle

124
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,638
There are even big entrepreneurs with gangster backgrounds

125
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,517
Choi Cheolmin doesn't represent
People who do that to their daughter

126
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,562
After all, he showed a warm image in the media

127
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,981
Let's say so

128
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,067
Even if he kills someone, he can retreat completely

129
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,569
His power has reached this level

130
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,862
(Lawyer Kim Lucheng)

131
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,660
Hello Lawyer Jin

132
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,872
The agency fee of 500 million won proposed to Representative Choi before

133
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,832
He said it was acceptable

134
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,042
OK

135
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,253
He said the cost is a bit high

136
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,339
But since you insist on this number, he agrees

137
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,049
how do you say?

138
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,926
OK I'll answer

139
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:49,803
good

140
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,475
The fees of the Como Fund have been negotiated. Let's start moving forward

141
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,310
Do you really want to take on this case?

142
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,649
Lawyer Yin really took on that case?

143
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,234
Yes, I don't understand either

144
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,278
He has always been strict with cases involving children

145
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,655
yes

146
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,741
Any child abuse involves
Cases of domestic violence or animal abuse

147
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,451
He doesn't answer anything

148
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,706
In addition, if Lawyer Yin eventually wins the case

149
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,750
Como Fund will become Gao Taisei's client

150
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,628
That guy's performance will immediately reach the top of the list

151
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,548
He already has a founder, dad
Plus that performance...

152
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,049
He will take the position of managing partner

153
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,802
Then we...

154
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,223
Don't think too much

155
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,392
You know what Lawyer Yin is like

156
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,187
You're here

157
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,564
What's wrong?

158
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,858
Lawyer Jin Lusung asked you to go to the conference room to meet him

159
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,669
I have no meeting schedule today
Is it an internal meeting?

160
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,778
no

161
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,906
It's the new client, it seems like it's going to have a divorce lawsuit

162
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,200
The other party came here without making an appointment

163
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,201
knew

164
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,078
See you back

165
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,294
Please don't worry too much

166
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,797
-We will do our best
-good

167
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,799
Here it is

168
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,051
Come in quickly

169
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,178
This is a divorce lawsuit entrusted...

170
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,137
Why are you here?

171
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,807
Do you know each other?

172
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,225
haven't seen you for a long time

173
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,710
I'll ask what you are doing?

174
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,064
What's going on?

175
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,859
Sorry, can we talk about it alone?

176
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,869
Who is she? How can you make Lawyer Xu so serious?

177
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,288
What's wrong?

178
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,874
nothing

179
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,168
Oh my God, it's so scary

180
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,045
who?

181
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,880
Is Lawyer Xu Minzhen?

182
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,799
Um

183
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,510
To be honest, she is more scary than my wife

184
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,139
But who is that person?

185
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,058
It is the client of a divorce lawsuit

186
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,311
She said it was for my reputation

187
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,479
I'm afraid it's Lawyer Xu's reputation

188
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,817
I mean you are worthy of being a naming partner

189
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,193
Look, she's here

190
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,571
-Thank you
-certainly

191
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,574
She's entrusting divorce lawsuit

192
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,493
It seems they are old friends

193
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,828
The atmosphere seems to be very tense

194
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:21,955
Yeah?

195
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,965
Next item in the Pohang earthquake

196
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,384
Insurance companies that pay insurance premiums to victims

197
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,011
File a subrogation lawsuit, we want to represent the defendant

198
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,180
It seems we have to go to Pohang to see the defendant

199
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,684
To me, I will take the lawyers Chi, Wu and Cui to

200
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,811
Just in time the Labor Department's case about Mayor Pohang

201
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,730
Administrative trial hearings are also arranged in those days

202
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,942
We expect to stay in Pohang for about a week

203
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,861
OK I get it

204
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,071
Everyone goes to Pohang

205
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,281
Xiaomin is about to become a left-behind child

206
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,658
You are the only one who stays in the office

207
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,742
Don't talk nonsense

208
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,702
yes

209
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,704
Next item

210
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,665
Next is case number 273-17

211
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,251
Choi Zhemin of Como Fund represents the nanny

212
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,378
Criminal charges for crimes such as reputation damage

213
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,921
Yes

214
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,090
How should I do it?

215
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,093
Arrange to meet with the nanny

216
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,857
Lawyer Jiang

217
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,483
This is the phone number and address of Choi's representative nanny

218
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,735
(7-1, Songbai Road, Zhengyuan District)

219
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,944
She has not answered the phone

220
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,488
I have to go to the court at two o'clock

221
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,616
Why don't you go see her first?

222
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,117
good

223
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,494
Let's hear what she says when you go

224
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,039
The key is to find out her demands

225
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,373
good

226
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,499
Lawyers Chi, Wu, Cui

We'll be on a business trip to Pohang tomorrow

233
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,868
-Do you know this place?
-I'll take a look

234
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,119
I know

235
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,038
You can get up from here

236
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,665

Thanks

240
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,470

242
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,937
Is anyone?

243
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,610
Who is it?

244
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,611
Hello

245
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:01,698
(Lu Lin Jiang Xiaomin)

246
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,367
I am lawyer Jiang Xiaomin of Lulin Law Firm

247
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,536
Is this Ms. Kim Young-soo's home?

248
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,122
Yes, what's wrong with you?

249
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,748
Who is here?

250
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,293
What kind of lawyer

251
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,294
What?

252
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,796
lawyer?

253
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,506
Hello

254
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,556
I really can't bear it
No choice but to do that

255
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,642
That poor child...

256
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,439
I don't know when every time I enter

257
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,649
The first thing is to check her scars

258
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,360
I don't know how many beats she got

259
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,446
I can't imagine how much she hurts

260
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,781
I don't know how scared she is...

261
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:50,079
Sometimes I clean and feel that the house is surprisingly quiet

262
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,498
I can't help but turn to look at her

263
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:58,546
I found that she was just staring out the window blankly

264
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,132
That's definitely not the look that a six-year-old should have

265
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,553
Is there any other evidence besides the photos?

266
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,974
I've thought about installing a pinhole camera to take some evidence

267
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,560
But now it's hard to make a living

268
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,147
So I just took photos of her scars

269
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,149
That is to say, there is no direct evidence

270
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,110
Can prove the injury in the photo
Is it caused by Choi Cheolmin?

271
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,988
Otherwise, what else could be going on?

272
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,907
Who can fall in every few days?

273
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,203
Have you ever seen Choi Cheolmin beat a child with his own eyes?

274
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,501
Although he is rude to the child
But I've never taken action in front of me

275
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:40,088
But you can tell by looking at the child's reaction

276
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,964
As long as her dad appears

277
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,343
The little face was immediately pale and hid behind me

278
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,303
Oh my God

279
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,015
Really I don't know how many times I've thought

280
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,017
I wish I could take her away from that home

281
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:59,065
One day I went to their house to work
I didn't see her everywhere

282
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,484
-Ninhide
-So I searched around at home

283
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,820
I thought she was out with her dad

284
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,405
But she found out she was hiding in the cabinet

285
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,406
Oh my God!

286
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,283
And I don't know how many beats I got

287
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,911
-Child
-I held her in my arms and cried

288
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,373
She could feel her trembling all over

289
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,541
Jinhide

290
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,710
I think something is wrong with her

291
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,339
Just about to take her to the hospital

292
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,426
-The devil is back with a man
-Mr.

293
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,385
Have you had a meal?

294
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,847
He was afraid that going to the hospital would expose his evil deeds

295
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,851
So I found a doctor to come to my house

296
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,938
Hello, teacher

297
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,690
I forgot to tell you before

298
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,901
After that, the doctor also came to the door from time to time

299
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,194
Treat her wounds

300
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,821
right

301
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,032
He didn't even send her to kindergarten before she recovered

302
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,998
No wonder there is no medical record

303
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,625
The kindergarten is unaware of it

304
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,960
That bastard is the devil

305
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,920
A beast who can't help but be beaten to death

306
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,092
I heard you called the police but the police didn't accept it

307
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,802
They're all in the same group

308
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,473
The police even told him that I reported it to me.

309
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,684
I can't even see In Young now

310
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,480
Since quitting that job

311
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,064
I've been having nightmares

312
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,108
Just the phone rings

313
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,986
I'm afraid something happened to In-young.

314
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,989
Heart pounding

315
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,949
That's why I decided

316
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,285
Find media news

317
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,788
But they don't take it seriously either

318
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,336
Anyway, what the nanny said seems to be true

319
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,962
It's too early to draw conclusions now

320
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,590
We have only one now
Kim Young-sook's one-sided words and a few photos

321
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,383
Her eyes can't deceive anyone

322
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,760
Do we have to judge the truth by looking at it?

323
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,470
Why do we need to judge the truth?

324
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,430
Things are suspicious, let's call the police first

325
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,349
Then leave it to the law to decide

326
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,184
Where can any lawyer report his client?

327
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,061
You are breaching your confidentiality obligation

328
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,771
To be disciplined

329
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,023
Is this time to worry about these things?

330
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,150
Since you are so afraid of breaking the law, I will report it

331
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,152
Even if I'm punished...

332
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,654
Don't act rashly

333
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,280
What?

334
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,240
You guys go out first

335
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,408
Lawyer Yin

336
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,328
You know I'm on my way back

337
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,914
Tell you how much I want

338
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,499
What did Choi Cheolmin do?

339
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:25,336
I thought you would act immediately

340
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,129
Never let him go to justice

341
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,881
Am I a prosecutor?

342
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,216
Or a judge?

343
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,175
What actions should be taken?

344
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,179
Don't act hasty. Just do your part

345
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,307
Let's go

346
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,776
Kang Xiao-sin!

347
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,407
You are a newcomer who just started

348
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,450
What is it? You dare to be the first to be a leader?

349
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,829
How did people like you get in? I'm so angry

350
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,788
how…

351
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,498
What's wrong with this?

352
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,791
the same as you

353
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,543
Is this how you bring new people?

354
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,879
You asked Kang Hyo-min to meet Choi Cheolmin's nanny alone?

355
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:10,881
Yes

356
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,218
What do you think?
Send a new person who doesn't know anything

357
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,761
Handle that kind of thing alone? You're a mess...

358
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,096
Is something wrong?

359
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,180
You can see it yourself

360
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,348
Look

361
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:27,064
Your lawyer has just arrived

362
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,025
you are done

363
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,527
I told her everything

364
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,404
She promised to save In-young

365
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,406
You will be punished severely

366
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,325
I'll fight you to the end

367
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,493
Send me the money quickly

368
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,620
Really

369
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,496
This is a woman who uses any means to make money

370
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,417
You've been pricked on our client
He also handed her a knife!

371
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,670
It's really good!

372
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,341
Go crazy!

373
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,318
You stupid

374
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,236
This little thing makes you depressed?

375
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,448
senior

376
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,033
That woman Kim Young-sook

377
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,118
Not only did you turn over the client's wallet

378
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,954
He also sold a famous watch

379
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,999
But Representative Choi Zhemin did not pursue the investigation

380
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,709
After all, she took good care of her daughter

381
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,712
But I didn't expect
She even moved his safe in the end

382
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,632
That's why Representative Cui asked her to resign

383
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,050
She holds a grudge for this

384
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,761
Threatening to report him

385
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,763
Say he abused children

386
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,016
You see

387
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,812
I checked Kim Young-soo's case

388
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,855
She is a habitual criminal of fraud and theft

389
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,108
I really didn't realize that she was that kind of person

390
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,694
Really a headache

391
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,030
By the way

392
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,157
Choi Cheolmin won’t go bankrupt because of this, right?

393
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,785
actually

394
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,746
He owes me some money

395
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,459
Really, I shouldn't mention this

396
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,462
Lawyer, you must be very busy. Thank you for coming here

397
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,812
Enter

398
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,365
I read Kim Young-soo's criminal record

399
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,493
terribly sorry

400
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,788
I was too tempted before

401
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,124
Not next time

402
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,881
You can't just because Kim Young-sook has a history of stealing and fraud

403
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:01,343
It is too much to infer that Representative Cui did not abuse his daughter

404
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,096
It seems like a bad person, but may also be kind

405
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,349
On the contrary, it seems like a good person

406
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,060
It may also do bad things

407
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,731
I see

408
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,193
Go

409
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,986
good

410
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,678
Why bother

411
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,806
You'll have a long trip

412
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,600
I owe you an apology

413
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,019
I should take good care of my lawyer

414
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,479
It doesn't matter

415
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,189
Just perform well in the future

416
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,776
The woman is as cunning as a snake
I must have played many tears cards

417
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,320
She is afraid that she has attended an acting training class?

418
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,280
Anyone who sees it will move

419
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,699
Anyway, Lawyer Yin is so capable

420
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,036
It will definitely be handled properly
Will not let gossip spread

421
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,329
certainly

422
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,001
I think it's not good to come with empty hand

423
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,879
So I bought something for my kids

424
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:21,799
My daughter?

425
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,760
Aunt Huang

426
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,306
Aunt Huang!

427
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,683
exist

428
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,228
Here comes

429
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,980
What will In-young be doing?

430
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,899
It should be in her room

431
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,882
This child is too greedy for birth

432
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,926
hurry up

433
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,928
Say hello to dad's friend

434
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,602
Have to talk

435
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,605
Hello Uncle

436
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,402
Hello In-young

437
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,253
This is a gift for you

438
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,967
What are you doing while standing there?

439
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,386
Say thanks now

440
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,516
Talk!

441
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,603
Thanks

442
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,271
You're welcome

443
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,791
What about the child's mother?

444
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,586
I don't want to mention that woman

445
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:24,964
This weekend

446
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,841
I and Nan Kuizhe, representative of Nanyun Group
Have an appointment to play golf

447
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,218
Do you want to be together?

448
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,220
South representative

449
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,640
Recently, there is a headache because of shareholder representative lawsuits

450
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,142
I've said a lot of good things about you

451
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,228
Why don't you guys talk while playing golf

452
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,063
good

453
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,232
Thank you for your care

454
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,942
I'll definitely arrive

455
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:00,958
Lawyer Jiang

456
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,712
-You are here
-Um

457
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,256
It's too hard to find here

458
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,717
I rarely come to such prosperous places

459
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,510
Um

460
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,512
I heard that travel expenses can be reimbursed?

461
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,431
Will give it after the end

462
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,311
Is something wrong?

463
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,483
I'm a little confused
What kind of person is Ms. Kim Young-soo

464
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm a thief
That's what that guy said about me?

465
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,702
All right

466
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,747
I didn't meet a good parent, nor did I pick a good husband

467
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,624
That's why cheating

468
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,128
But I saw stray cats starving and freezing in the rain

469
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,089
I can't bear it

470
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,884
I just want to get out of that devil

471
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,011
Rescue In-young

472
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,224
You said you weren't for money?

473
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,978
Then how did you quit that job?

474
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,855
-That's...
-Your attempt

475
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,067
Stealing 50 million cash from Mr. Choi Zhemin's house

476
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,527
He was caught by the police, right?

477
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,613
That's a trap

478
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,866
When I heard that the police did not accept reports of abuse

479
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,952
Just think about having to take the kids to escape

480
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,245
But

481
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,584
I have no money and no deposits

482
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,962
That's when I saw the safe

483
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,381
That thing is usually locked tightly

484
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,425
But a crack was opened that day

485
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:37,346
I just walked out the door with my money and my kids

486
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,389
The police were stuck outside

487
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:45,270
You're still threatening
To report the abuse, let him pay hush money

488
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,481
I am the one who is threatened!

489
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,109
I'm living on salary

490
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,945
But he didn't even pay a month's salary
No resignation fee will be given

491
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,905
I just want to get back what I deserve

492
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,907
But he turned his head

493
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,494
Want to cut off my life!

494
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:08,961
(Complaint)

495
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:09,920
What's this?

496
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,924
The accused Kim Young-sook is suspected of destruction of reputation and false accusation

497
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,718
This complaint lists relevant criminal facts

498
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,305
What?

499
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,060
"The accused Kim Young-soo

500
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,396
For the purpose of extorting money from Choi Zhemin

501
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,606
Knowing that there is no accuser

502
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,483
In the case of abuse of his daughter Choi In-young

503
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,486
Still on the grounds of abuse
Make false reports to judicial authorities

504
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,488
Constitute false accusation”

505
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,324
"The accused Kim Young-soo
To the reporter of Wenzhen Daily

506
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,411
False report of Choi Cheolmin to his daughter Choi In-young

507
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,163
Perform abuse

508
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,747
Constitute the crime of reputational damage”

509
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:51,336
"The Criminal Law stipulates that the purpose of slandering others is to
Spread false facts through media

510
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,423
Hence the crime of reputational damage
Can be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than seven years

511
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,051
Or fines of less than 15 million won”

512
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:02,014
This devil really hurt In-young!

513
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,141
You scum!

514
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,101
asshole!

515
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,020
You must die a little!

516
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,483
"The Criminal Law stipulates that those who blatantly insult others

517
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,152
Can be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than one year or detention

518

Or fines below two million won”

519
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,532
I'll add insults

520
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,872
We will also file a civil lawsuit

521
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,416
You help your husband pay off his debts and you're not able to make ends meet.

522
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,794
Paying fines and compensation will only make things worse

523
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,130
Do you still have money to hire a lawyer?

524
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,640
Then let's see you in court

525
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,935
What do you want?

526
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,355
what you think?

527
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,526
Stop making trouble

528
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,239
I will make you regret it

529
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,116
I'll charge of extortion

530
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,701
Send you to jail

531
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,335
(Commitment letter)

532
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:17,965
What's this?

533
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,466
Commitment letter

534
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,219
Promise if we cancel civil and criminal proceedings

535
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:27,015
You will no longer report child abuse falsely

536
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,143
If the promise is violated, it will cause damage to my client

537
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,396
Must bear triple compensation liability

538
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,440
Take a closer look and then press your handprints

539
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,750
(Complaint)

540
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,336
(Commitment letter)

541
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,550
(Party B: Kim Young-sook)

542
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,750
Too aura

543
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:37,961
You really have something

544
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,714
I'll have to ask you for more things in the future

545
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,716
Things were handled so neatly

546
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,345
I've got a few more troubles to deal with

547
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,597
Contact you next week

548
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,432
no problem

549
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:55,937
You go slowly

550
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:01,545
You told me not to over-interpret
Kim Young-sook has a criminal record

551
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,964
Then why are you like that?

552
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,675
You want to bully the weak

553
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,552
Do you flatter the powerful?

554
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,640
You said something

555
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,599
say what?

556
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:15,809
At least I'll just make a few excuses

557
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,185
Why?

558
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,077
What are you doing?

559
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,287
Choi Cheolmin

560
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,830
I want to report him myself

561
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,792
Will the police solve everything if you report it?

562
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,170
If the case is closed without prosecution...

563
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,590
We only have those photos in our hands

564
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,467
He asked a doctor to come to the home for treatment

565
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,677
She also framed the nanny and prevented her from speaking up again

566
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,387
He's a smart guy

567
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,055
Most of the funds of the Como Fund

568
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,349
All from the powerful

569
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,269
He helps those people launder money and adds value to the money legally

570
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,315
Just for the crime of abuse of daughter
We never want to send that bastard to jail

571
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,609
If you make a big deal now

572
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,195
That bastard will definitely go home without any damage

573
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,947
What will happen to the child then?

574
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,739
I wasn't angry at you just now

575
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,243
See you tomorrow

576
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,305
-Good morning
-morning

577
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,306
Good morning

578
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,815
Good morning

579
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,900
-Good morning
-Good morning

580
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:29,859
Good morning

581
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:08,940
Hold on

582
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,813
What is he busy with?

583
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,371
-Good morning
-Good morning

584
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,357
Secretary Xu

585
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,316
What?

586
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,569
Who are those people?

587
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,405
I heard it is from a financial consulting company

588
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:06,659
Secretary Xu

589
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,829
Is Lawyer Yin going out?

590
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:13,082
Yes, he said he would leave for a few days

591
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,417
oh

592
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,255
morning

593
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,217
What's wrong?

594
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:24,517
Why don't you eat it?

595
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:25,662
Say it

596
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,417
Lawyer Yin…

597
00:38:27,456 --> 00:38:28,331
Um

598
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,518
He hasn't been to the law firm for several days

599
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,852
so what?

600
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:33,853
It must be a business trip

601
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,146
Not a business trip

602
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,315
It's said it's an external schedule

603
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,234
Why didn't he come back?

604
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,485
Is something wrong?

605
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,571
Shouldn't you be grateful if your boss is not in the company?

606
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,575
I contradicted him a few days ago

607
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,954
I'm worried it has something to do with this

608
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:51,913
Please

609
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,624
It seems like he will care
You're just a newcomer

610
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,667
You're just making a big deal

611
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,877
Why do you care so much?

612
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,172
It won't...

613
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,466
how?

614
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:04,559
You didn't?

615
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,553
Of course not

616
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,513
He is my boss and he is married

617
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,597
He even has a child

618
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,683
Yes?

619
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,893
I thought you were because of Han Sheng's praise

620
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,062
My mind is not clear

621
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,022
Han Sheng praised...

622
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,484
You haven't officially broken up yet
How could he go on a blind date with someone else?

623
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:22,443
Stop!

624
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,195
You guys say that bastard

625
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,990
Is it worthy to delay our precious supper time?

626
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,575
- Not worthy
- Not worthy

627
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:31,911
Where will he be?

628
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,844
(Tuesday, April 15)

629
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,845
Where will he be?

630
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,931
Is my chair so comfortable?

631
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,478
Lawyer Yin!

632
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,523
Where have you been?

633
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,565
Why haven't you come to the law firm?

634
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,025
What's wrong?

635
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,485
Is something wrong?

636
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,153
No

637
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:30,989
only…

638
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,534
Do I still have to report my itinerary to the newcomers now?

639
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:35,994
Need not

640
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,954
I'll go out now

641
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,416
Kang Xiao-jin

642
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,209
exist

643
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,213
Wipe your eyes

644
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,433
Why is the office so quiet?

645
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,852
Everyone is on a business trip to Pohang

646
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,027
-Go out
-good

647
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,180
Hello

648
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,058
Lawyer Yin

649
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,434
What's up?

650
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,687
This is really a headache

651
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,359
Is something wrong?

652
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:51,944
That's it

653
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,031
My daughter seems to be while I'm not at home
Run out for a while

654
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,951
I don't know who called the police again

655
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,162
The police are blocking my doorstep

656
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,666
This is really difficult to deal with

657
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,129
Have you hit her?

658
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,799
Why do you need to ask questions clearly?

659
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,134
I know you must have found out that day

660
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,264
You know clearly
But for the sake of agency fees and big cases, I took over it.

661
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,142
Is she okay?

662
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:25,603
Not very good

663
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,940
I can't let the police see her

664
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,484
I'll go there right away

665
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,985
Yeah?

666
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:34,654
I'll know

667
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:36,823
Thanks

668
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,334
Help me find Secretary Huang

669
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,712
Secretary Huang's sister gave birth to a baby. He will be in the hospital now.

670
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,173
I thought you knew

671
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,424
Is something wrong?

672
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,051
I can drive a car

673
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,303
Come with me

674
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,888
I'll give you the car keys

675
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:01,889
good

676
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,867
Waiting here

677
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,422
lunch

678
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,798
Have you eaten?

679
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,550
police…

680
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,261
They left straight

681
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,181
I rang the doorbell a few times but I didn't open it

682
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,432
They're leaving

683
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,559
I obviously didn't do anything illegal

684
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,312
Why do you feel panic when you see the police?

685
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,482
It's a waste of time

686
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,569
Let's get things done

687
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,904
What?

688
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,572
The police may come again

689
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,074
Can't let her stay here

690
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,535
The child is evidence

691
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:06,871
We have to destroy the evidence

692
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,248
how?

693
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,126
Do you want me to kill my daughter?

694
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,670
I've contacted the doctor

695
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,215
Send her back as soon as the treatment is over

696
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:20,927
Our lawyer Yin

697
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:22,678
It's really good!

698
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,263
Clean and neat!

699
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,265
Where is she?

700
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,100
In her room

701
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,356
It's okay

702
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:17,984
Come

703
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,278
Uncle takes you out of here

704
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,388
Then I'll leave first

705
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,640
OK Thanks

706
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,810
etc.

707
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,116
My good daughter

708
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,994
Don't cause trouble. Listen to uncle's words carefully

709
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,332
Dad talks to you and answer "Yes"

710
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,417
Let's be louder!

711
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,626
yes

712
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:21,088
Very good That's right

713
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:29,847
Go

714
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,685
I'll contact you after it's done

715
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,467
It's okay

716
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,244
drive

717
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,163
Drive quickly!

718
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,206
good

719
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:44,755
(Huizhu Hospital)

720
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,884
(emergency room)

721
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,107
-Preparing for surgery
-OK

722
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:05,818
What's the problem?

723
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,028
It looks like mesenteric bleeding

724
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,085
(Operating room)

725
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,601
(Huizhu Hospital)

726
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,060
How about it?

727
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,479
We successfully stitched the bleeding point

728
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,522
If it were a little later, the consequences would be unimaginable

729
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,817
Poor child

730
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,444
I knew that this would happen sooner or later

731
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,160
How do you...

732
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,746
He called me

733
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,748
Lawyer Yin?

734
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,086
The day I put my handprints on the promise letter
He comes to ask me for help

735
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,631
He said if he angered Choi Cheolmin

736
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:12,301
In Young's situation may be worse

737
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,055
He also asked a lot about Choi Cheolmin

738
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,558
(Huizhu Hospital)

739
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,081
Please follow the car ahead

740
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,184
A beast that is worse than a pig or a dog!

741
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:52,943
Are you still laughing?

742
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,070
You dare to laugh?

743
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:57,906
Scum

744
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,457
You can actually be a parent...

745
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,336
-Lawyer Yin!
-You still laugh?

746
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,295
Lawyer Yin!

747
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,713
open!

748
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,676
Smile, bastard, continue to laugh!

749
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,470
OK, stop

750
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:31,065
Damn it! Are you a bastard lawyer crazy?

751
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,733
Big brother

752
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,069
Why are you here?

753
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:37,863
Really

754
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,116
Kill that bastard

755
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,411
You're done, a bastard!

756
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,413
You don't know who he is, do you?

757
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,920
What to do?

758
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,755
What are you bastards doing?

759
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,759
Let me go, bastard!

760
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,886
You almost beat him to death

761
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:04,473
You come to me
Don’t you just want to dirty your hands?

762
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:14,650
Things that have been agreed upon before...

763
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,487
Please do what you say

764
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,615
The same to you

765
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,367
This will also benefit you

766
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,161
certainly

767
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,414
The rest of the materials I'll give you tomorrow

768
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:29,832
All that's enough

769
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,544
That bastard Choi Zhemin

770
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,922
Embezzle my money little by little with me on my back

771
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,883
I know now

772
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,595
He opened a shell company in the Cayman Islands

773
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:46,765
Through branch funds
Making the flow of funds extremely complicated

774
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,685
If it weren't for you
I'm afraid I'll be kept in the dark for the rest of my life

775
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,021
I'm a businessman who started with fists

776
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,356
I can't understand his tricks

777
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,025
But you do this is probably not out of kindness, right?

778
00:53:58,569 --> 00:53:59,445
What do you want?

779
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,908
This is Choi Cheolmin's daughter

780
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,119
Six years old this year

781
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,626
(Doctor's opinion letter)

782
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,629
Is this what Choi Zhemin did?

783
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,882
In order not to let outsiders notice

784
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,968
Even asked a doctor to treat her

785
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,767
"Eye for eye for eye, tooth for tooth"

786
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,977
Please help me with justice

787
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,856
Then I must embezzle his money

788
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:37,816
I'll come back a lot

789
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,038
You're bleeding

790
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,568
Lawyer Yin!

791
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,199
Lawyer Yin

792
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,576
How are you?

793
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,232
Don't you have to deal with the wound?

794
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,362
I'm fine

795
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,364
Thank you

796
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:16,868
You're welcome

797
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,083
He is a devil who can be a parent...

798
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:28,714
Jinhide...

799
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,929
If she were my child

800
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:40,851
yes

801
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,603
Lawyer Yin

802
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,648
Must be a good dad

803
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,360
How old is your child?

804
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,575
I don't have children

805
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:58,702
What?

806
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:03,457
You got off work early before, didn’t you go to pick up your children?

807
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,545
My ex-wife and I

808
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,381
Have a dog together

809
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,142
You go back

810
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:23,769
I'll stay here

811
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,261
Choi Cheolmin was tortured by them

812
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,639
(I'm on vacation)

813
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,516
(Contact again when you come back)

814
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:09,397
(Edit personal information)

815
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,070
(Ah, you need a rest! It's on vacation)

816
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,280
No one around him noticed any abnormalities

817
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,203
It's okay

818
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,330
His abuse of his daughter
All retribution is on myself

819
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,416
Homomorphic revenge

820
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,920
Eye for eye For tooth for tooth

821
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,723
Cui Zhemin paid agency fee

822
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,725
Deposited into Renying's trust account

823
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:47,894
What do you think recently?

824
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,107
He is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder
Go to the hospital for treatment

825
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,150
(Doctor's opinion letter)

826
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,902
At the same time, lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon keeps his promise

827
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:59,197
Help Huang Taicheng recover the money that Choi Zhemin embezzled

828
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,157
(defendant)

829
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,202
Take this opportunity
Other investors have filed lawsuits

830
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,579
Choi Cheolmin eventually went bankrupt

831
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,830
(plaintiff)

832
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,915
After that, Choi Cheolmin

833
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,877
Be imprisoned for fraud and illegal possession

834
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:16,923
In-young's custody

835
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,051
Handed over to mother. She had suffered domestic violence before.

836
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,928
Only then did you choose to divorce Choi Cheolmin

837
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,896
It's said that blood is thicker than water

838
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:34,774
Sometimes people are related by blood
Tolerate crime

839
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,484
Turn a blind eye and turn a deaf ear

840
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,654
Sometimes the care of strangers

841
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,907
Rather, it will be more bloody

842
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,618
Deeper and stronger

843
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,555
-Good morning
-morning

844
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:15,690
morning

845
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,484
senior

846
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,568
You're so excited

847
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,070
I'm so happy to see me

848
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,529
Is it boring to stay alone?

849
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:22,989
What's the weather like in Pohang?

850
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,116
I don't know what the weather is like

851
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,409
Always working

852
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:27,911
Is this okay?

853
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,454
Here

854
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:31,373
fine

855
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:33,333
Good morning

856
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,626
Why are you again?

857
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:36,920
Lawyer Chi

858
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:37,879
Small country!

859
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,132
Why did you suddenly have this expression?

860
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,719
Long time no see, so happy

861
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:46,096
My Law School is in the same period

862
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:47,555
Why are you doing this? It's so stingy!

863
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,640
Have you taken the wrong medicine?

864
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,936
- Lawyer Jiang
- Lawyer Cui

865
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:53,895
Lawyer Wu Good morning

866
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:55,438
-Good morning
-How are you doing lately?

867
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:56,690
You must be exhausted

868
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,734
We should go on business trips more

869
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:01,778
-Why?
-Look at Lawyer Jiang welcomes us

870
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,738
Very touching

871
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:05,657
-Start work?
-good

872
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,327
Lawyer Yin is here

873
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:47,115
About the part where the safety device is not installed
Need to make some more explanation...

874
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,038
Your face is red

875
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,420
Did you catch a cold when you got in the rain yesterday?

876
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,671
no

877
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,340
Sorry, I'll be back soon

878
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,106
Have you caught a cold?

879
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:28,323
It seems not

880
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,127
I'm Yoon Seok-hoon

881
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:45,840
Yes

882
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,807
Lawyer Yin

883
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,766
Let's talk about it later

884
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,021
He's very busy

885
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,738
I'm the master of the hash

886
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:09,823
You go in

887
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,660
What's going on?

888
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,537
Just a bit of food

889
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,164
What did you feed it?

890
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,962
We've given it an injection, nothing will happen

891
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:26,798
Hash!

892
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,466
Don't be so exaggerated. OK?

893
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,052
"exaggerate"?

894
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,053
What did you say?

895
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,555
You heard it

896
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,181
Please speak quietly, two people

897
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,933
Hash also...

898
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:39,936
Come out with me

899
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:44,816
See you later

900
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,610
Tell me what's wrong?

901
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,740
What's going on with you? Can you take good care of it

902
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:53,783
You need to take good care of it

903
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,076
I'm staring at you

904
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,286
I'm staring at you, too

905
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,579
Don't learn from me

906
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,580
I didn't learn from you

907
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,123
Childish demon

908
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,583
Childish demon

909
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,168
-You are really...
-You are really...

910
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,544
-I…
-how?

911
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,629
Do you want to hit me again? Come on

912
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:10,008
Do you feel no guilt towards me?

913
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,259
What guilty?

914
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,052
I thank you for letting Yanya go

915
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,095
You...

916
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,764
We were together after you broke up completely

917
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,016
What do I feel guilty about?

918
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,767
You've obviously been eyeing Yan Yahoo

919
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,311
Stop talking, okay?

920
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,229
Two years after you divorce

921
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,273
I met her by chance. You know

922
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,400
Then you can marry the ex-wife of a high school friend?

923
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,568
Please find out

924
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,946
Long before I met you, I was friends with Yanya

925
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,282
Strictly speaking, I am Yanya's friend, not yours

926
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,825
We're better back then

927
