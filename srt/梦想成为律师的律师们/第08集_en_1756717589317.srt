"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

2
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,581
The formulation of liability clauses is intended to accurately reflect…

3
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,584
There are a group of Wonder Woman in this world

4
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,253
Can turn the impossible into possible

5
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,838
…It will deviate from the original negotiation results You mean…

6
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,174
Some of them are both successful professional women

7
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:53,470
Wife from a happy family
The most reliable mother of the child

8
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,931
This is perfectly used to control the three roles

9
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,433
All-rounded Wonder Woman

10
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,977
It’s because people like you have entered the house!

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,103
How dare you talk nonsense!

12
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:05,357
There is also one way to use one's own way
Overcoming adversity and trials

13
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,277
-Self-strength Wonder Woman
-The principle of common property...

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,281
About the recent controversial
Virtual currency regulation issues

15
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,826
We invited Seoul University
Professor Choi Eun-hee from the School of Law will discuss together

16
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,202
Thank you for taking the time to participate in the program

17
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,203
(Anchor Han Xueyan)

18
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,997
Thanks for the invitation

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,915
The government recently issued...

20
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,001
Xueya! Xiaomin! Come and see it!

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:24,793
What's wrong?

22
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,129
Your mother and Xueya's sister
He was in the same frame on TV!

23
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,422
Really

24
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,509
Sister Xueyan is the ace anchor of JTBS
It's normal to have a high appearance rate...

25
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,635
(Professor Choi Eun-hee)

26
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,430
…But we, Ms. Eun-hee, have also been on the news recently

27
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,390
Does she want to go into politics?

28
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:43,061
Ms. Eun-hee is getting busier
Who will be our snail girl in the future?

29
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,272
She won't come for the time being

30
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,566
-Why?
-Why?

31
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,526
Because she threw your plate?

32
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,695
Have you had a quarrel with your mom?

33
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,281
What to do?

34
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,285
Sister Xueyan looks particularly dazzling today

35
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,829
Sister Xueyan is my idol

36
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,332
Lee Ji-eun is really a loyal fan of Han Xueyan

37
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,750
She's just on camera

38
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,255
Another type is to stand proudly at the top of the industry

39
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,007
The recognized Wonder Woman

40
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:17,929
Chapter 8: Wonder Woman

41
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,306
-Please continue
-good

42
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,474
(Lu Lin)

43
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,268
This is a book prepared by lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon himself

44
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:27,481
Contains confidential information that is extremely unfavorable to MGC Securities

45
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,899
With this information

46
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,276
Lawyer Yin can almost lock in the victory

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,237
But the problem is, lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon

48
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,823
Where did you get this information?

49
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,911
Lawyer Xu Huizhen is currently acting as MGC

50
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,415
You mean lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon
Dating with lawyer Xu Huizhen

51
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:50,295
It was Lawyer Xu who provided the materials to Lawyer Yin

52
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,463
Is that what you mean?

53
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,548
Isn’t this a reasonable doubt?

54
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,426
Otherwise, MGC strictly confidential information

55
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,595
How could it be leaked?

56
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,888
at this point

57
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,599
I'm afraid lawyer Yin needs to explain

58
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,978
I won't explain

59
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,402
But I will provide evidence

60
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,904
Prove that Lawyer Gao’s claim is purely slander

61
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:16,863
What?

62
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,742
I also requested defamation
Give severe disciplinary measures

63
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,703
OK

64
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,788
If Lawyer Gao’s claim is true

65
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,499
Then Lawyer Yin will be subject to disciplinary punishment

66
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,000
If found to be slander

67
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,004
Lawyer Gao will bear the corresponding responsibility

68
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,465
Do you two have any objections?

69
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,591
No

70
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,968
Neither I have

71
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,095
Lawyer Yin

72
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,890
Do you have evidence to prove that this is slander?

73
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,101
Written materials displayed on the screen

74
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,477
I've seen it for the first time today

75
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,606
Adverse information about MGC Securities
It's the first time I've learned

76
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,567
Nonsense

77
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,028
So how was this document submitted to the court?

78
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,614
Not submitted to the court at all

79
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,199
What are you talking about...

80
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,787
You're sure

81
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,248
The stolen document
Is it really submitted to the court?

82
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,042
You can verify it anytime

83
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,882
What the hell is going on?

84
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,259
So

85
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,344
Who wrote that document?

86
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,681
This should be easy to find out, right?

87
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,058
Starting last year, in order to strengthen the confidentiality system

88
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,353
All files are given a unique identification code

89
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,438
That's right

90
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,148
Have you seen the encoding at the bottom of the file?

91
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,692
There is still such a thing?

92
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,361
(Lu Lin#05055422V0.9)

93
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,239
Just trace that string of codes
You can find the person who wrote the file

94
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,118
Come on

95
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,745
Come here soon

96
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:54,252
Who is so bold and dares to disturb me playing games?

97
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,132
Hello, I'm Jiang Minjun

98
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:02,928
OK

99
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
Lawyer Jiang Minjun

100
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,160
Did you write this document?

101
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,412
I don't know what you're talking about

102
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,998
I asked if this written material was drafted by you

103
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,131
no

104
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,466
I've never seen this document

105
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,885
Each file has a unique identification code

106
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,263
Track the identification code display of this file

107
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,183
This is written and printed by lawyer Jiang Minjun

108
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,644
Are you saying you have no idea?

109
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,903
Hello?

110
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,908
OK I get it

111
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,663
The technical department just confirmed

112
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,748
In the computer of lawyer Jiang Minjun

113
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,669
Files with the same number

114
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,006
Do you still insist that you don’t know?

115
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,511
idiot

116
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,555
Get out of here, idiot

117
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,393
-Scared me
- Senior Jiang

118
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,394
So what's wrong?

119
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm in trouble, the computer crashes again

120
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,023
Come again? What's going on?

121
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,442
I don't know if this has to be sent out immediately. I'm finished

122
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,360
It's not my business. Go to someone else

123
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,695
Everyone is busy

124
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,654
Who can lend me?

125
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,406
Really

126
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,826
Senior, lend me a job and I can write it for you

127
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,244
Documents for project payments

128
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,623
-Really?
-real

129
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,707
Let go quickly

130
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,876
-Will you write for me?
-certainly

131
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,252
Don't move my game

132
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,378
No

133
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,339
When did you get so many levels?

134
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,383
Then I'll have a coffee

135
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,137
This is too messy

136
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,061
(Investment money return)

137
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,106
(Example method)

138
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:32,869
Secretary Jin

139
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,789
This is the written material of TS Insurance suing MGC Securities

140
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,707
-Please submit it to the court
-OK

141
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,459
Please be sure to keep confidential

142
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,460
-no problem
-Thanks

143
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,433
I'm Li Zhenyu

144
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,768
Please come to my office

145
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,727
OK

146
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,618
(Investment money return)

147
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,247
Look at my pig's brain

148
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,417
I just got the wrong USB drive

149
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,253
Written materials required to be submitted to the court
I'll email you

150
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,505
-Can you return the USB drive just now?
-OK

151
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,631
I'm really sorry

152
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,263
Since you can't answer

153
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,100
Then I'll ask Lawyer Gao Taixie

154
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,437
Where did you get that document?

155
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,526
What did he get it from where?

156
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,653
It was handed over to me by lawyer Jiang Minjun

157
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,196
I think the matter is serious

158
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,783
Reported to Lawyer Gao

159
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,455
Lawyer Jiang Minjun

160
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,414
What?

161
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,082
Answer me

162
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,669
good

163
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,133
Can you give me some time?

164
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,217
Can

165
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,887
After all, the situation is special

166
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,014
I understand it's hard for you to answer now

167
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,019
If possible, I want to give him a day to consider

168
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,437
this

169
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,857
If you don't mind, I don't mind

170
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,484
good

171
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,361
Even if Lawyer Yin’s claim is true…

172
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,572
Even if it is true

173
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,741
Put a female lawyer

174
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,495
Especially for the other party's lawyer in major cases

175
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,872
Take it to your own home in the middle of the night

176
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,582
Isn’t it because of improper behavior?

177
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,418
Is that thing?

178
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,463
The reason why lawyer Xu Huizhen went to me

179
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,091
To report workplace bullying

180
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,801
And the person she wants to report

181
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,011
It's Hong Daoyun

182
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,514
What?

183
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,147
Lawyer Yin

184
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,400
Please help me

185
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,157
at first

186
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,619
I thought he scolded me because I was not proficient in business

187
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,955
Why do I always ask me to repeat?

188
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,665
sorry

189
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,543
What a cat or dog that got in?

190
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:31,047
So I worked harder

191
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,553
Elementary school students can do better than you

192
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:38,972
sorry

193
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,766
Everyone is ready to have a meal together

194
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,059
-OK
-OK

195
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,395
-Why
-You said

196
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,356
This is a bit urgent. I have to send it out tomorrow

197
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,608
You may not be able to go to the dinner

198
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,488
It doesn't matter

199
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,447
I'm sorry

200
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,658
-Go away
-good

201
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,682
(Please refer to the above content to handle related transactions)

202
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,565
That document has no loopholes and no problem

203
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,818
(Lawyer Hong Daoyun)

204
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,779
What's going on with row spacing? Really

205
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,741
Why can't you even do this little thing well?

206
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,576
All in a mess

207
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,078
Really convinced

208
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,581
Are you just perfunctory?

209
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,084
sorry

210
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,629
-Come on louder!
-sorry

211
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,048
Then I understood

212
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,051
He's bullying for the sake of bullying

213
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,304
I really can't stand it. I've thought about reporting it

214
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,389
But he has power and power

215
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,350
I don't know what the consequences will be

216
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,561
I'm afraid I'll ruin my reputation
It will be even harder to find a new job

217
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,148
So I plan to leave my job voluntarily and start looking for a new job

218
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:14,817
Lawyer Xu

219
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,405
-exist
-Are you free tonight?

220
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,244
-available
- That's OK

221
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,663
I'm going to entertain an important client tonight

222
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,039
Can you go with me?

223
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,126
OK I get it

224
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,378
See you later

225
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,554
This atmosphere is really good tonight

226
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,764
Thanks

227
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,814
-Please use it slowly
-I'll fill it up for you

228
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,065
What a privilege

229
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,363
As long as I go to the dinner with him...

230
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,781
-Thanks
-goodbye

231
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,992
…Bullying can be stopped for a short time

232
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,293
To be honest

233
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,213
I didn't expect that Lawyer Xu would drive the atmosphere like this

234
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,798
Do you still have this kind of talent?

235
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:20,925
You've been awarded

236
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,344
Now it seems that your smile is beautiful too

237
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,143
Now, isn’t it rude to say such things?

238
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,769
It doesn't matter

239
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,062
I'll...

240
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,063
Yeah?

241
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,066
I just thought it was a dinner at a high-end restaurant

242
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,236
Just go with him once or twice a week

243
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,655
Has he forced you to accompany a client or...

244
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,823
No

245
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,826
No at the beginning

246
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,330
Most of them are serious business dinners

247
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,789
But once

248
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,751
A client crossed the line

249
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,295
So I got up and left

250
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,297
Hey

251
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,469
You think I'm a lawyer
Is it to endure this treatment?

252
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,470
I see

253
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,263
I understand everything

254
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,598
But the person inside

255
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,184
He went to law school but failed the judicial examination

256
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,269
Now I can only be a legal intermediary and make a living by barely

257
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,146
He is very inferior

258
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,981
So no matter whether the other person is a man or a woman

259
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,608
He does that with any lawyer

260
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,276
Not for you only

261
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,236
Then is his behavior justified?

262
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,700
You're pretty attractive when you get angry

263
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,744
Eliminate the air

264
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,454
I'll teach him a lesson for you

265
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,956
When he said that

266
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,210
My mood is very delicate

267
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,421
He has been nice to me since then

268
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,634
There were several dinner parties afterwards

269
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,517
It doesn't matter

270
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,186
Say whatever you want

271
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,108
at last…

272
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,945
I've had sex with him

273
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,156
He was fooled by that kind of person

274
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,368
It's so shameful to think about it

275
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,745
But I was obsessed with the authorities at that time

276
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,374
Later he became more open-minded
Start asking me to attend dinner frequently

277
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,084
It's good for me to say he succeeds

278
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,628
I try to get out every time but...

279
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,089
Why don't you arrange a serious job for me

280
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,716
Instead, I have been letting me attend the dinner?

281
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,468
Dinners are also part of the work

282
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,053
Just write it on your work schedule

283
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,764
No, I won't attend your dinner again

284
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,307
If you keep forcing me

285
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,310
I'll report you to bully in the workplace

286
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,650
Bullying?

287
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:45,695
I said

288
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,449
Who would believe one
A woman who is having sex with a married man?

289
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:50,950
What?

290
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,369
If you report it, will I sit back and wait for death?

291
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,955
I just say we have an extramarital relationship

292
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,207
You volunteered to attend those dinner parties

293
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,293
If that's the point
Who do you think will bear the consequences?

294
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,252
Is it you or me?

295
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,963
Maybe we'll all be scolded
But women will always be scolded more fiercely

296
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,089
Do you know why?

297
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,050
Because even if I'm married, people think

298
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,803
"You are so young and beautiful
A smart woman seduces her

299
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,889
Which man can withstand it? ”

300
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,183
And what about you? This kind of thing happened
Can you still get married?

301
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,102
What nonsense?

302
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,857
He used that relationship to threaten me

303
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,234
I really thought it would be better to die than to stop

304
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,573
But I decided to give you a try.

305
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,161
There are others like you

306
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,122
Female salary lawyer who encounters injustice

307
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,295
She is my client

308
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,922
I'll handle it myself

309
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,133
Look at you, here again

310
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,718
Why are you always so arrogant?

311
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,764
What happened?

312
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,850
It's okay, don't worry...

313
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,190
What are you doing?

314
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,025
Really convinced

315
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,074
Gao Eun-jin, Kim Soo-mi

316
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,785
It seems that your next goal is Jiang Xiaomin

317
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,622
Don't want to be crushed, just crawl away

318
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,797
I'll handle it

319
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,025
Put it four years ago
Completely organized implementation

320
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,777
But lately it's very...

321
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,781
Representative

322
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,116
How do you...

323
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,662
What's going on now? Let's explain

324
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,330
This is…

325
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,250
Our group is having a meal

326
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,253
Choose a group dinner in adult entertainment venues

327
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,672
Still only female salary lawyers are invited?

328
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,842
The male lawyers...

329
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,177
Choi Jung Hyuk and Kim Ho-jin's lawyers

330
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,263
I said before that I couldn't come if I had something to do...

331
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,099
Lawyer Choi Jung-hyuk and lawyer Kim Ho-jin

332
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,767
-exist
-exist

333
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,979
What's the urgent matter today
Do you not allow you to attend the group dinner?

334
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,149
-No
-No

335
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,697
Who are these people?

336
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,202
Attorney Shin Enmei

337
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,370
Who are they?

338
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,339
I asked them who they are

339
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,135
They are intermediaries

340
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,481
Accepting cases by intermediary such non-legal person

341
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,275
Violation of the Lawyer Law
You have to be punished criminally, do you know?

342
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,944
Know but...

343
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,863
But I...

344
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,199
Submit a resignation letter before tomorrow

345
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,742
Criminal charges against him

346
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,120
And take all disciplinary measures within the scope of the law

347
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,080
OK

348
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,835
Representative, please give me a chance to go back to the law firm to explain

349
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,050
Representative, this is too...

350
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,930
How dare you

351
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,265
Take Lulin's female lawyer

352
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,267
Treat it as a drinker?

353
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,853
you

354
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,899
Even if you starve to death, you will not be allowed to enter the legal world again

355
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,702
Brother, you should call me in advance

356
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,995
What a crazy dog

357
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,499
Is this really going to happen?

358
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,420
Really?

359
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:22,972
Lawyer Yin

360
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,183
Are you satisfied now?

361
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,938
Push everything to Hong Daoyun

362
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,357
Just tell me who instructed Jiang Minjun to frame you

363
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,484
It's also Hong Daoyun

364
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,946
Why do I do that?

365
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,699
My father Gao Shengzhe is one of the founders of Lu Lin

366
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,577
You're so smart, you should understand
If you dare to touch me, things will be a big deal

367
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,954
Do you want to ask me for help or threaten me?

368
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,916
I want to ask you for help

369
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,294
Let's stop here this time

370
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,175
-Is that how you ask for help?
-What do you want?

371
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,301
Do you want me to kneel down?

372
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,348
The basic principle of transaction is to go and go

373
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,560
Lawyer Choi Heezhe…

374
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,314
Send him to DA Solutions

375
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,317
What?

376
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,904
It's your trick before
The job that lawyer Quan Nayeon did

377
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,159
Or do you want to go there for Lawyer Cui?

378
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,247
One more thing

379
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,713
From now on, no matter what I do

380
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,175
You'll stay quiet for me and nothing is allowed to do

381
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,603
(Lu Lin)

382
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,855
Big news Super exciting

383
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,065
Lawyer Hong Daoyun

384
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,526
-He resigned
-What?

385
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,485
So sudden?

386
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,238
The security guard is packing his stuff now

387
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,448
Oh my God, what the hell...

388
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,699
-Yes?
-What's going on?

389
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,410
But everyone seems to be secretly happy

390
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,829
Of course

391
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,455
(Han Xueya)

392
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,877
Xueya

393
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,465
Sister Xueyan?

394
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,926
Which police station? I'll arrive soon

395
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,556
Mr. Cui Minguo Hey!

396
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,517
What are you looking at?

397
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,895
Answer me Where were you at two o'clock last Wednesday?

398
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,690
It was indeed Han Xueyan, the news anchor!

399
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,067
-It's true
-It's Han Xueyan

400
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,652
Han Xueyan!

401
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,945
No photos allowed!

402
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:43,904
Let it go quickly

403
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,656
-Give me
-What's the situation?

404
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,242
Sit quietly, sit well, you all sit well

405
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:49,827
elder sister!

406
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,667
elder sister

407
00:22:58,961 --> 00:22:59,837
Xueya

408
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,881
Sister, are you okay?

409
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,632
Open the door

410
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,800
no

411
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,385
I am Ms. Han Xueyan's lawyer

412
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,137
Have you seen this wound?

413
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,763
She beat and smashed

414
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,474
Extremely strong

415
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,810
Because she was a public figure
I still want to show mercy to my subordinates

416
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,104
But I can't control her at all

417
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,316
elder sister

418
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,109
What's going on?

419
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,695
I don't remember

420
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,407
I fell asleep after taking the medicine prescribed by the psychiatrist

421
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,868
Wait for me to wake up

422
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,621
It's here

423
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,788
what happened?

424
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,460
Han Xueyan beat her husband and was arrested on the spot

425
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,756
Will treat her within 48 hours
Apply for a detention order on suspicion of special injury

426
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,258
etc.

427
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,177
This is impossible

428
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,930
My sister has never scolded anyone

429
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,598
Have never fought with anyone

430
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,059
What does "special damage" mean?

431
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,394
And to brother-in-law?

432
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,481
We have all the evidence
And she was arrested on the spot

433
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,695
Where is my brother-in-law now?

434
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,365
The victim is receiving treatment in the hospital

435
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,951
The situation is not optimistic

436
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,250
News anchor Han Xueyan is suspected of beating his spouse

437
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,378
Emergency arrest

438
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,879
She was photographed just now

439
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,548
After the investigation, he left the police station

440
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,427
Ms. Han relies on her capable working women
And the image of a virtuous wife

441
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,221
Always loved by the public

442
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,767
Deciding whether to issue a detention order
Detention necessity review hearing

443
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,895
Schedule for Wednesday at 10:30 a.m.

444
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,606
It's incredible

445
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,274
You mean Ms. Han Xueyan

446
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,777
Is it your roommate's real sister?

447
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,028
Yes

448
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,530
We're not just roommates

449
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,657
Since elementary school, I've been as close as a sister

450
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,117
Too shocked

451
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,286
She doesn't look like someone who can hit her husband at all

452
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,122
It wasn't

453
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,790
Always feel something is wrong

454
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,377
Let's prepare materials for the necessity review of detention first

455
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,379
OK I'll go prepare

456
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,007
(Court)

457
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,843
The suspect currently has a fixed residence

458
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,263
Have a stable job and live with your family

459
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,222
(Defendant's agent)

460
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,390
There is no risk of escape at all

461
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,350
Comprehensive the above situation

462
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,686
Requesting the court to dismiss the detention order application

463
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,438
clear

464
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,899
Existing evidence is insufficient to adequately demonstrate the need for detention

465
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,652
Dismissed the prosecutor's application for detention order

466
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,404
(Prosecutor)

467
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,165
don’t worry

468
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,584
There is a high possibility of acquittal

469
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,086
We can argue for loss of mind

470
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,464
After all, she was

471
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,508
Take psychotropic drugs
He committed a crime in an unconscious state

472
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,053
If you claim to lose your mind, you should be sentenced to innocence.

473
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,140
Han Xueya, don’t you believe me?

474
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,184
I'm Jiang Xiaomin

475
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,519
Um

476
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,605
don’t worry

477
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,486
It is not easy to argue that mental loss

478
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,654
If considered as loss of mind

479
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,823
The court must declare innocence

480
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,534
Therefore, the court will be more cautious

481
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,495
The trial process is likely to be extended

482
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,790
Even if the first instance is acquitted

483
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:26,126
If the prosecution appeals, the trial is likely to continue

484
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,089
It's better to advocate a weak mind and strive for a probation

485
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,424
This is the more realistic and advantageous choice

486
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,301
No, Lawyer Yin

487
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,345
Must advocate loss of mind

488
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,138
My sister is a well-known news anchor

489
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,224
If you cannot be acquitted, there is no meaning

490
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,142
You and I know both

491
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,227
Doing this is risky

492
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,480
I know, but the same sentence

493
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,441
Must get a guilty sentence

494
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,737
Han Xueyan is my close friend's family and pride

495
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:58,033
I can't bear to let her leave her with her ex-discipline

496
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,745
Be sure to argue for loss of mind

497
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,124
I'll consider it

498
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,752
First of all, I have to meet Ms. Han Xueyan's attending doctor

499
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,724
Hello?

500
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,269
Right Yes

501
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,646
Yeah?

502
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,232
Then I'll go there right away

503
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,276
Arrive soon

504
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,236
good

505
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,155
See you later

506
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,097
Get on the car

507
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,557
No, I'll just take a taxi

508
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,601
Get in the car quickly, I'll give you

509
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,440
Thanks

510
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,447
It's so amazing

511
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,158
I was able to contact you the day before I immigrate

512
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,368
Thanks to the Internet, this is what happens

513
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,494
yes

514
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,208
Give

515
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,919
It's broken long ago

516
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,004
And it has been discontinued, so it cannot be repaired

517
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,965
I didn't expect it to come in handy now

518
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:37,966
Yes

519
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,677
This was bought on my honeymoon

520
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:44,014
I didn't use it at that time
So the contents are directly stored in the machine

521
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,974
Later, I switched to mobile storage

522
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,644
But the initial thing that exists in the camera has not been deleted

523
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,895
That's it

524
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,313
Very magical, right?

525
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,815
It may be in the dark, and there is a will of heaven

526
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,445
The contents cannot be viewed on other devices

527
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,072
Want to view the video

528
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,825
I have to fix it first, I'm afraid it's a little difficult

529
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,744
I'll try it

530
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,622
-good
-Thank you so much

531
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,918
OK I'm going to leave

532
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,877
OK

533
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,587
Thank you so much

534
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,071
You haven't left yet?

535
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,030
Um

536
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,033
What's this?

537
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:45,993
Camera

538
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,202
But it's broken

539
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,039
The manufacturer said it has been shut down for a long time and no replacement parts are available

540
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,418
But I still have to search everywhere. Who knows?

541
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,753
What to do with that effort?

542
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,881
I'm the youngest of three men and three women

543
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,425
My dad is the youngest of three men and four women

544
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,011
My mom is the eldest of five men and three women

545
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,762
What do you want to say?

546
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,015
-The number is amazing?
-really

547
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,559
My parents' family group has more than two hundred people

548
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,269
so what?

549
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,187
With these two hundred people as their backing

550
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,440
There is nothing I can't find in Korea

551
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,484
Interesting, but can you tell the point?

552
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,485
Don't be anxious

553
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,782
alright

554
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,494
Put things in hand

555
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,913
- Come with me
-Where to go?

556
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,290
Just follow me, go

557
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,875
You are...

558
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,297
Can it be repaired?

559
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,550
I have to open it and see it before I know

560
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,845
But I collect old-fashioned cameras

561
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:50,223
It should be able to be from other machines
Disassemble a few parts to repair

562
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,101
Really? As long as you can fix it

563
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,145
Money is not a problem

564
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,104
knew

565
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:57,481
Leave it to me

566
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,401
How long does it take?

567
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,404
I'm having a lot of work now

568
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,572
One month?

569
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,407
Two months?

570
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,742
Fixed I'll contact you

571
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,999
I am Li Shuohe's nephew

572
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,584
What?

573
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,669
Are you Shuohe’s nephew?

574
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,129
Yes, wait a moment

575
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,013
Second uncle, I am Zhenyu

576
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,349
I'm in this store you recommend but...

577
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,559
OK I'll ask him to answer the phone

578
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,938
It's my second uncle, Li Shuohe

579
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,899
Hello?

580
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,610
Big brother

581
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,820
How are you doing lately?

582
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,822
Brother, you will be unrighteous

583
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,533
My nephew is coming, I should tell me earlier

584
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,451
Yeah?

585
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,288
Ouch, don't worry

586
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,623
Will definitely be resolved immediately

587
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,377
No problem, let's make two cups another day

588
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,674
It turns out you are Shuohe's nephew

589
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,384
Why didn't you say it earlier?

590
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,344
Should I say it earlier? How long does it take?

591
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,304
When will you want it?

592
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,639
The faster the better

593
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,141
Can it be done today?

594
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,100
OK

595
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,726
I'll take a look and contact you later

596
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,686
good

597
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,687
thank you

598
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,855
-Thanks
-no problem

599
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,025
Let's go eat something

600
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,531
It's great to have such a big family

601
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,576
-Yeah?
-certainly

602
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,827
What about your family situation?

603
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,036
I don't have family

604
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,329
What?

605
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,585
My dad passed away very early, only my mom and I were left

606
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,464
When I was 23, she left too

607
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,677
Don't look at me with that look

608
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,679
Makes me uncomfortable

609
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,474
Where do I have it?

610
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,602
Ouch

611
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,188
I really want to divide my family into half of you

612
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,899
wrong

613
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,319
Just join our family

614
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,738
Then what should we...

615
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,158
Should we get married?

616
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,077
Listen to what you are saying

617
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,498
Speaking of it

618
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,251
What's in that camera?
You're so anxious to see

619
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,468
My mom and I have the first time
It was also the last trip to Jeju Island

620
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,970
But as soon as I got there, I lost my camera

621
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,933
There was a couple in the tour group at that time

622
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,101
We agreed to help each other shoot

623
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,270
That's it, we took a lot of videos

624
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,856
But then I sent an email to ask them to share the video

625
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,484
Maybe the address is wrong and I am always rejected

626
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,612
I felt like there was no way, so I just passed by

627
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,822
But after my mother died

628
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,534
I miss her very much

629
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,954
Mom is always embarrassed to take photos

630
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,039
So only a few old photos left

631
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,501
She's always busy taking photos of me

632
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,087
But then I remembered the previous trip to Jeju Island

633
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,464
So to find that couple

634
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,174
I've posted online for several years

635
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,801
The lady who gave you a camera before...

636
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,843
right

637
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,680
It's a miracle, right?

638
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,641
Just like a gift from my mother

639
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,525
Hello?

640
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,694
OK Let's go there soon

641
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,613
(Camera repair, second-hand acquisition, film, battery)

642
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,046
We're on our honeymoon

643
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,341
-Can you take a photo for us?
-no problem

644
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,177
that

645
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,138
Sorry, but...

646
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,645
My mom and I are traveling

647
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,898
But I lost my luggage as soon as I arrived, so I didn't have a camera

648
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,483
Too bad

649
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,570
If both don't mind
I can always shoot for you

650
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,989
Can you please ask two of you to take some photos for me and my mother?

651
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,199
Mother

652
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,576
Look here

653
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,328
- Relax
-Look at the camera

654
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,000
Mom, this is not a photo, it is a video

655
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,962
Come and put on a pose

656
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,255
Let's compare "Yes"

657
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,179
What do you think of traveling with my daughter for the first time?

658
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,224
Very happy and very happy

659
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,646
You work hard and send your only daughter to Seoul University

660
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,315
How do you feel now?

661
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,485
Feels great!

662
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,614
Very happy!

663
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,456
Mom, are you crying?

664
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,540
No

665
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,544
You cry even if you are happy or cry even if you are sad

666
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,047
I haven't dried my tears

667
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,050
Stop crying

668
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,652
Cry out loud, it's okay

669
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,090
(Seiyan University Hospital)

670
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,010
Can you please say it again?

671
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,055
What does Ms. Han Xueyan suffer from?

672
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,141
Bad women syndrome

673
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,435
(Psychological collapse caused by domestic violence)

674
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,397
It seems her husband's domestic violence
Lasted for ten years

675
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,982
Years and months

676
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,735
Women suffering from habitual violence

677
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,321
Body and mind will become exhausted

678
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,741
Shows symptoms such as depression, anxiety and sleep disorders

679
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,745
This is what Ms. Han Xueyan was doing when she first diagnosed

680
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,958
Rib fracture takes seven weeks to recover

681
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,546
She told the doctor that it was caused by a car accident.

682
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,340
Ms. Han Xueyan said

683
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,176
She lost consciousness after taking prescription medication

684
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,594
What medicine is that?

685
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,430
It is a drug containing zolpidem and diazepam

686
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,808
Because she developed resistance to her previous prescription drugs

687
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,018
So about a month ago I changed it to this medicine

688
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,770
Is there any medicine?

689
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,439
Side effects that lead to temporary loss of consciousness?

690
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,440
have

691
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,068
Case reports show that after taking this medicine

692
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,611
Short as 4 hours Long as 12 hours

693
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,447
There will be loss of consciousness

694
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:46,699
clear

695
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,446
Garbage scum

696
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,618
Xueya!

697
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,054
Prosecutor Please state the facts of public prosecution

698
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,472
(Spouse injury case first public trial)

699
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,436
The defendant was at his residence on May 26, 2025

700
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,356
Throw objects at his spouse Han Sung-soo and commit direct violence

701
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,026
Injury that it needs treatment for 12 weeks

702
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,195
How did the defendant respond to the facts of the public prosecution?

703
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:09,157
The defendant took prescription medicine before the incident

704
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,035
Losing memory completely at the time

705
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,953
It is claimed that he is in a state of loss of mind

706
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,872
According to the victim's statement

707
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,124
The defendant was in the process of violence
Call the victim's name and insult

708
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,543
Call the emergency number immediately afterwards

709
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,462
Therefore, we claim the defendant's mental state

710
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,589
Not completely missing the discernment of right or wrong

711
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,925
Or the ability to decide meaning

712
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,384
But just that ability has been weakened

713
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,387
A state of weak mind

714
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,765
To confirm that the defendant was at the time of the incident

715
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,516
Is it in a state of loss of mind?

716
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,978
Now apply for prescription medication
Determine mental state

717
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,231
What is the prosecutor’s opinion on this?

718
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,193
We have doubts about the necessity of appraisal

719
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,362
But the decision of the presiding judge will be followed

720
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,990
OK Approve the appraisal application

721
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,202
Please submit an appraisal application for defense lawyer

722
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,408
Sister, let's sleep for a while

723
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,620
Did you see how I looked in the hospital today?

724
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,790
It's OK

725
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,418
Just don't take that medicine anymore

726
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,004
I'm with you

727
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,884
Did Xiaomin see it too?

728
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,094
Yes, sister

729
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,849
Isn't it scary?

730
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,358
But I like myself that way

731
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:51,944
What?

732
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,322
I'm getting stronger after taking the medicine

733
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,824
Like Wonder Woman

734
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,993
You know me

735
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,914
I have never even spoken loudly to others in my life

736
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,583
I know

737
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,546
But I'm not like that in the video

738
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,466
I'll yell if I want to

739
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,468
Get angry if you want to be angry

740
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,427
"video"?

741
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,516
What does that mean?

742
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,059
What video?

743
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,271
actually…

744
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,137
Installed

745
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,471
-Thanks
-You're welcome

746
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:04,725
At first I wanted to see
What happened during my memory loss

747
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,603
So the monitoring is installed

748
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,727
I've watched that video repeatedly

749
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,021
Me in the video

750
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,815
Just like Wonder Woman

751
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:58,279
I'm punishing bad guys like Wonder Woman

752
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,158
I've never said a word to anyone before

753
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,285
Although I can't believe I'll do that

754
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,662
But it feels

755
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,625
I have been in my heart for a long time
Something was finally released

756
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,837
I can finally breathe

757
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,638
After that incident, I prepared meals for him once

758
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,059
He shivered as I approached him

759
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,519
Just like me once

760
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,612
A few days later he came back drunk again...

761
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:44,909
He even hit me

762
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,081
I'm very depressed and can't sleep

763
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,210
So even if you know what happens after taking medicine

764
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,378
I still ate it on purpose

765
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,881
I want to become Wonder Woman and teach him some lesson

766
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,467
elder sister

767
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,054
Except for us
Have you told others about these things?

768
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,681
No

769
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,224
Xueya

770
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,017
Let's talk a few words

771
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,147
What did you say?

772
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,358
What is "original voluntary"?

773
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,652
Free behavior in cause

774
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:24,365
Simply put, it is when doing something
Can predict the results

775
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,034
Intentionally induce yourself to fall into a state of

776
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:30,454
For example, someone plans to kill someone

777
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,999
But because of tension or lack of courage

778
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,128
So I deliberately drink and commit a crime after getting drunk

779
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:41,215
Normally
Drunk state can suggest weak mind

780
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,719
But because I was drunk on purpose
So it cannot be considered weak

781
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:49,515
Take the initiative to put yourself in a state of mind
So you can't evade responsibility

782
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,934
You mean my sister took the medicine on purpose
And become aggressive

783
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,394
This is also the case?

784
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,770
Yes

785
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,108
If she deliberately took medicine to become Wonder Woman

786
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,485
Even on the grounds that drugs cause amnesia

787
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,446
Advocate mental loss

788
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,198
The prosecutor can also
"Free Causes" to refute this claim

789
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:10,202
It means to advocate mental loss
She couldn't get a guilty sentence, either?

790
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,663
Yes

791
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:27,928
Kang Xiao-jin

792
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:31,682
do you remember?

793
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,227
When you asked me to teach you sign language

794
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,647
("Introduction to Korean Sign Language")

795
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,483
OK I got it

796
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,401
but

797
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,528
I have a condition

798
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,654
no problem

799
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,698
Once in this life

800
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,743
You want to help me unconditionally

801
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,036
help?

802
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,829
Pull hook

803
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,123
good

804
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,463
I'll ask you to help you now

805
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,592
-Xueya
-At that time, it was agreed to "unconditional"

806
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:13,099
As a doctor, you have the professional ethics of a doctor

807
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,851
-I am a lawyer...
-"Once in this life"

808
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,521
"Unconditional"

809
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,440
You always say it yourself

810
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,401
Law is not always just

811
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,363
You've seen it too
What my so-called brother-in-law did

812
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,116
Just thinking about it makes my blood surge

813
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,411
If I had known it earlier
I'll beat him up to a swelling face.

814
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,540
Is it justice for my sister to go to jail for this?

815
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,417
Is this what you call justice?

816
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,726
It's been ten minutes

817
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,520
If it's not easy to speak...

818
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,771
It is the cause of free behavior

819
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,523
What?

820
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,318
Han Xueyan's violence case

821
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,946
Han Xueyan took the medicine on purpose

822
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,867
She knows drugs can make herself violent

823
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,328
So I took the medicine on purpose and wanted to resist my husband

824
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,205
Did she say this herself?

825
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,291
Yes

826
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,334
She may not know

827
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:25,004
These words will be bad for you

828
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,381
Who else knows about this?

829
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,924
No one at the moment

830
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,092
Why did you tell me?

831
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,802
I'm very messed up

832
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,598
Don't know what to do

833
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,310
I don't plan to treat the professional ethics of junior lawyers
Carry out micromanagement

834
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,730
I'll pretend I didn't hear you, you'll decide

835
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,440
If I can decide...

836
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,483
You've decided long ago

837
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,405
Then let me tell you what I think

838
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,699
For me

839
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,494
Justice is to protect the person I must protect

840
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,747
I can do anything for this

841
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,375
Even if it is illegal?

842
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,419
As a lawyer, I definitely can't do that

843
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,005
Of course it must be within the legal scope

844
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,054
But I don't mind getting holes under the legal guise

845
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,647
Don't think about things like a dwarf trapped in dogma

846
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,565
Try to relax your mind

847
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,452
Xueya

848
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,746
We'll see you at Sister Xueyan's house

849
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,248
good

850
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,716
What you told us before

851
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,802
Never tell anyone

852
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,178
-Do you understand?
-good

853
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,972
No, prosecutors can do it either

854
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,473
Your doctor is not good either

855
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,641
Can't say to anyone

856
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,642
good

857
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,813
Is the surveillance camera still there?

858
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,524
exist

859
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,234
Where is the video?

860
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:12,945
On my phone

861
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,449
I'm going to take this away

862
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,538
Sister, you can refuse to make statements that are unfavorable to you

863
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,123
But no false statements can be made

864
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:25,541
good

865
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,210
If asked unfavorable questions

866
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,629
Just exercise the right to silence

867
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,507
OK I won't lie

868
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,099
(Spouse injury case, second public trial)

869
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,184
Criminal Collegiate Case No. 250916 in 2025

870
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,270
Start trial now

871
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,274
The appraisal result of the defense lawyer's application has been issued

872
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,401
What is the defense lawyer’s opinion?

873
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,737
As shown in the appraisal report

874
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,448
After taking prescription medication

875
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,158
Completely lost discernment of right and wrong

876
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,994
Or the ability to decide meaning

877
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,831
It is the case within 30 minutes after taking the medicine

878
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,791
No memory

879
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:11,128
And as described in the appraisal report
Side effects of this prescription drug

880
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,630
Repressed prefrontal function

881
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,798
Induce violent behavior

882
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:19,219
Therefore, the defendant's violent behavior in the public prosecution facts of this case

883
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,056
It is not due to the defendant's free will

884
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,225
Should be considered as loss of mind and declared innocent

885
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,227
Apply for previous application

886
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,688
The appraiser will be questioned

887
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:30,689
Allow a question

888
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,068
May 29th

889
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,988
You observed the defendant
Status after taking prescription psychiatric medications? Is it right?

890
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,448
right

891
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,407
(witness)

892
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,578
Presiding Judge This is the surveillance video of the day

893
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,301
How could she not remember that?

894
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,389
She seems to be crazy

895
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,226
Look at how she throws her pillow

896
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,277
How was the defendant's status during this period?

897
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,487
She is in a state of loss of consciousness

898
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,907
Showing impulsive behavior and extreme violence

899
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,702
Other patients suffer from loss of consciousness

900
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:28,288
Have you also had violent or aggressive behavior?

901
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,082
None hasn't appeared

902
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,876
Ms. Han Xueyan is an extremely rare case

903
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,753
Can you explain it?

904
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,256
To analyze Han Xueyan's brain activity changes

905
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,299
We performed a brain MRI scan

906
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:40,592
(Han Xueyan's brain MRI before and after taking the medicine)

907
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,554
Above is MRI of Ms. Han's daily brain

908
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,347
Below is

909
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,976
Brain MRI taken after taking prescription medication

910
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,270
The red marking area below…

911
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,063
(Before taking the medicine, after taking the medicine)

912
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,483
...is the frontal part of the frontal lobe, that is, the prefrontal cortex

913
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,779
This area is responsible for regulating emotions and suppressing impulses

914
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,073
And dominate social judgment

915
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,827
Many experts draw prefrontal cortex

916
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,037
Called the "brain braking system"

917
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:14,168
That is, when aggressive or impulsive behavior is about to occur

918
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:18,046
The prefrontal cortex plays a role in regulation and control

919
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,173
clear

920
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,801
But it can be confirmed that the defendant had taken the prescription medication

921
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:26,722
Frontal lobe activity significantly decreased

922
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,099
As you see

923
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:33,187
The area that should have been bright becomes blurred

924
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:38,734
This means that the defendant's frontal lobe function was inhibited

925
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:40,486
What does this mean?

926
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,491
Based on the above situation
It is reasonable to speculate that the defendant may be

927
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,742
Showing aggressive tendencies

928
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:48,911
OK

929
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,705
Inquiry is completed

930
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:56,877
defendant

931
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,506
Can you tell us
What are your memories of the first and last of that day?

932
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:05,427
My favorite TV show ends at 11pm

933
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,012
I fell asleep watching the show that day

934
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,474
Wake up and find out

935
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,311
I'm wearing handcuffs and staying in the detention room

936
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,316
Do you remember nothing?

937
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,943
Yes

938
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,529
According to the police, you were handcuffed

939
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,948
I asked if I could bring it with me

940
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,241
Handbag on the dining table

941
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,871
It seems they want to guide in a weak direction

942
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:34,581
It seems to be

943
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:53,350
Criminal Collegiate Case No. 250916 in 2025

944
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,062
Defendant Han Xueyan This court now announces the verdict

945
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:01,358
(Defendant agent Defendant)

946
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,947
The defendant is not guilty

947
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,875
The main purpose of this case is now announced

948
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,511
Respect our great lawyer Jiang Xiaomin

949
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:32,806
Even though I'm not here
But he made great contributions to winning the acquittal verdict

950
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,433
Lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon

951
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,018
cheers!

952
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,686
-cheers!
-cheers!

953
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,737
-That video...
-What?

954
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:48,780
Have you deleted it?

955
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,283
Not yet it's time to delete it now

956
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,242
Yeah?

957
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,620
Then before you delete it...

958
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,626
Hello!

959
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,420
Your husband is back!

960
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,842
What are you doing so late?

961
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,596
Are you deaf?

962
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,680
Talk

963
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,811
Why are you still eating this place?

964
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,563
Look at what you look like

965
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,982
Han Xueyan!

966
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,359
Are you crazy?

967
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,655
If someone asks you, you have to answer!

968
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,962
Get ready to go to hell, bastard

969
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:48,632
Look, I won't beat you to death today
Just like you used to hit me

970
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,758
Dog bastard!

971
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:25,919
Do you still have instant noodles at home?

972
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,921
There should be

973
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,633
Am I going to cook? Or who will you go?

974
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,385
I'll go

975
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,557
Is there any beer?

976
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,434
No more

977
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,941
where did you go?

978
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:48,984
Go buy beer

979
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,862
Buy some potato chips

980
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,293
Have I thanked him?

981
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:23,810
Who is there?

982
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:26,855
Lawyer Yin

983
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,815
Where have you been?

984
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,485
Go brushing your teeth

985
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,613
I thought you weren't here

986
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,323
Is there anything wrong?

987
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,870
I just remembered that I haven't thanked you well before

988
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,040
thank you

989
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:46,708
good

990
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,879
Did you go back to the law firm just to say this?

991
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:51,880
Yes

992
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:55,092
I think you might be in a law firm
Handle temporary seizure of construction companies

993
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:58,470
I'm about to finish work and go home

994
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,514
That's it

995
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:02,557
See you tomorrow

996
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:03,517
good

997
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,645
Lawyer Yin

998
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,067
Want some beer?

999
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,405
very nice!

1000
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,494
Such a beautiful rooftop
But we can't come often because of our busy work

1001
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,703
What a pity

1002
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,961
I like what you said before

1003
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:36,591
Justice is to protect the people you must protect

1004
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:42,013
Last time you said

1005
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:47,602
You realize it
What a sharp tool language can be

1006
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,899
I think it's because of this
You won't use that tool at will

1007
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,193
I will only use it to defend the client

1008
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,615
Use it to protect the people you must protect

1009
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,953
I've had similar thoughts before

1010
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,457
My parents are both legal practitioners

1011
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,626
So naturally I think

1012
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,004
I'll choose to be a lawyer

1013
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,590
But when I was a kid

1014
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,177
I witnessed my mom in court
Kill the other person's heart with sharp words

1015
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,096
I began to think that this path might not be suitable for me

1016
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,931
Later I went to high school

1017
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,852
My friend's dad suffered an injury

1018
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,105
But I met a bad boss and didn't get any compensation

1019
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,940
Didn't receive a resignation payment

1020
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,027
So I asked my mother for help

1021
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,238
I put on her clothes

1022
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,240
Even imitating her tone

1023
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,783
Go and confront your boss

1024
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,329
I can see that he is guilty

1025
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,998
Even though I was just a high school student at that time

1026
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,334
Then I understood

1027
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,545
The problem is not the sharpness of the language

1028
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,174
Where is this tool used

1029
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,219
For whom

1030
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,597
If I can use it to protect the people I must protect

1031
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,725
This profession is interesting

1032
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,603
I feel like this is my duty

1033
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,941
It's your job indeed

1034
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,068
This job is perfect for you

1035
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,195
I'll be relieved if you say that

1036
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,407
This case...

1037
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,996
I originally felt like
Walking alone in the dark tunnel

1038
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,627
But you borrowed me a flashlight. Thank you

1041
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,354
Are they claiming that you killed him on purpose?

1042
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,189
Not to kill him

1043
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,400
Instead, let the destined death go with the flow
