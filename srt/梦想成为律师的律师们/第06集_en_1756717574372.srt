"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

2
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,403
What are you doing?

3
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,617
What's going on with this woman?

4
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,535
Who is she?

5
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,249
Enough

6
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,460
How could there be such a crazy woman?

7
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,212
Let's go

8
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,963
Wait, I want to call the police

9
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,590
Let's go, okay?

10
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,667
If you can't speak now, we can wait...

11
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,421
I broke up with my beloved

12
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,925
We've been dating for eight months

13
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,388
Less than three months after breaking up

14
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,848
That's it

15
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,059
He already has a new girlfriend

16
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,562
I used to love him very much

17
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,772
so…

18
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,900
It's hard for me to accept

19
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,153
really

20
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,535
I want to sue my ex-boyfriend

21
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,539
You're sad because of breaking up. I understand

22
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,918
But whether it is criminal or civil lawsuit
All must have legal basis

23
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,256
The breakup makes you suffer, it's really a pity

24
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,468
But this kind of harm cannot be investigated legally

25
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,137
I'm afraid I can't help you

26
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,699
This was done by my ex-boyfriend

27
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,658
What?

28
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,584
I want to sue him

29
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:05,847
Chapter 6: Love can also make people weak

30
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,280
Be extra careful not to irritate the wound

31
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,034
Yinying, you have a scar constitution

32
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,204
Once injured, the scar will protrude

33
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,540
And the wound will spread

34
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,126
Your skin is sensitive
Even small wounds can easily leave scars

35
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,134
If it's an ordinary person
This kind of small wound will not leave any scars

36
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,055
But you have a malignant scar body

37
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,140
So this is a serious scar left

38
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:54,104
If I receive treatment, can I completely remove scars?

39
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,857
Keloids are difficult to remove completely

40
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,277
Currently, this kind of injection treatment can only be used to relieve it

41
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,612
If the surgery is done...

42
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,823
No, that will only be more serious

43
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,827
Because wounds from surgery may also form keloids

44
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,248
Is there no other way?

45
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,542
I'm a model

46
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,003
But because of these scars, I can't work now

47
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,172
That's really...

48
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,562
Everyone's time is precious

49
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,939
I'll tell a long story

50
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,442
Today we are gathering everyone to announce an important thing

51
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,319
From today I will officially retire

52
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,279
Transferred as consultant

53
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,198
Brother, what's going on?

54
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,409
Now I want to introduce my successor to you

55
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,830
New managing partner of the law firm

56
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,957
Lawyer Quan Nayeon

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,293
Please come on stage

58
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,253
The name itself is the signature?

59
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,055
Kwon Nayeon?

60
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,139
I've never seen her in a law firm

61
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,725
She wasn't sent to
Is DA Solutions Company?

62
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,935
DA solution?

63
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,771
It's a small company in the countryside

64
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,357
Say it's an outspo
Actually, it was excluded in office politics

65
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,776
It's really the return of the king

66
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,696
Inauguration ceremony and my departure ceremony

67
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,115
It will be held at 2pm tomorrow

68
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,621
South Korea's top law firms will welcome for the first time
Not from the School of Law of Seoul University

69
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:39,209
Female representative lawyer in her 40s

70
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,629
You are sincerely invited to attend at that time

71
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,506
Witness this historic moment

72
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,966
Notification completed Thanks

73
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,720
Look at the horse

74
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,389
Hello, be careful when speaking

75
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,395
(Lu Lin appointed the first
Female management partner in her 40s)

76
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,940
represent!

77
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,692
You didn't discuss it with me

78
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,651
Let's sit

79
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,277
Why is Quan Nayeon...

80
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,654
What exactly are you thinking?

81
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,240
Don't be excited, sit down and say

82
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,866
Are you really going to retire?

83
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,535
Why not wait for five years

84
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,828
Pass the seat to me...

85
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,621
-Passed to you?
-I…

86
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,623
That way

87
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,458
Who will follow you?

88
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,418
What?

89
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,006
Law firms are not like ordinary companies

90
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,509
There is no such thing as inheritance of management rights

91
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,678
The law firm implements a partnership system

92
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,639
Which partner here
Will you follow you like I do?

93
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,767
But... dad

94
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,771
Besides, a ship that will sink
Why do you have to fight to be the captain?

95
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,358
I asked you to warn lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon not to be arrogant

96
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,860
Why are you still with him?

97
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,821
We finally drove away his coach
You found her again...

98
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,573
The world has changed

99
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,285
Nowadays, law firms compete for professional strength

100
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,413
Those who are ungrateful
Old antiques who rely on contacts only

101
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,331
How long will we let them go?

102
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,792
Do you need to solve it yourself?

103
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:03,793
Can you do it?

104
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,426
You need to understand

105
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,887
We just need to watch from behind the scenes

106
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,598
Just look at those executioners waving their knives

107
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,559
After things are done, get rid of them

108
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,270
Then step into the new arena gracefully

109
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,397
Keep doing our way

110
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,024
What?

111
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,901
them

112
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,986
It's just our tool

113
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,945
Just an executioner

114
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,281
But…

115
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,325
them…

116
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,495
Kwon Nayeon and Yoon Seok-hoon are not that easy to deal with

117
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,996
It's really hard to deal with

118
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,623
That's why I handed the knife to them

119
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,582
So

120
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,293
How do you get rid of them when things are over?

121
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,548
Who do you think they are going to deal with first?

122
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,926
It must be those who are undervalued

123
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,261
Former attorney and consultant with low case handling ability

124
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:59,474
But who will follow one
The executioner who waved his sword at those people?

125
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,727
What are the law firms implement?

126
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,314
-combine…
-Yes, partnership

127
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,400
Leaders who don't get respect from their partners

128
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,402
Can't really lead a law firm

129
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,573
Sadism?

130
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,201
so what?

131
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,912
Unfortunately, Ms. Xue Yinying

132
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,957
Scar constitution
Skin is very prone to scars due to trauma

133
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,127
Normally, no scars are caused

134
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,295
Intimate behavior

135
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,048
But it caused Ms. Xue Yinying
Scars have been formed and the scope has continued to expand

136
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,259
Now it looks shocking

137
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,177
More importantly

138
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,638
She's a model

139
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,183
Too bad

140
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,226
But

141
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,354
If the principal does not agree to the abuse

142
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,314
It should be a crime of injury

143
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,274
That's right

144
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,900
I've asked her

145
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,778
She said before having sex
Ex-boyfriend will be like going through the process

146
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,864
Let her sign a letter of consent

147
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,448
It's so meticulous

148
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,075
Have you drunk?

149
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,703
If you agree after getting drunk
Because she lacked the ability to think at that time

150
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,663
We can claim that consent is invalid

151
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,415
I've asked this too

152
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,376
But she doesn't drink at all
So that doesn't exist

153
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,711
This is difficult to deal with

154
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,797
It is to constitute the crime of injury

155
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,342
We must claim that consent is invalid

156
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,846
Why?

157
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,183
Is the agreement valid?
What is the relationship with the crime of injury?

158
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,768
Oh, scared me

159
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,147
If I play your head now

160
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,106
Is it considered violence?

161
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,649
Of course

162
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,195
If we say it
If you lose the game, you will be able to hit your forehead?

163
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,905
- That's not counting
-Why?

164
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,117
have no idea

165
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,328
What about boxing matches?
Isn’t it considered violence when both sides fight each other?

166
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,079
Of course not counting

167
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,372
Why?

168
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,416
That's sports competition, not violence

169
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,502
In principle, the act itself is a violent act

170
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,922
But because the other party agreed in advance

171
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,423
So it does not constitute a crime

172
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,303
Suppose you are subject to school violence

173
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,139
Agree to play the bullet-brow game
Not out of true wish

174
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,976
But fear of revenge
What about agreeing under force?

175
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,229
That's not true agreement, so it's a violent act

176
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,313
That's right

177
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,565
If the victim's consent is to stop the illegality

178
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,985
The victim must be in
In a normal state of making decisions

179
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,945
Only agree

180
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,947
The most intuitive example is

181
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,699
If the victim is drugged or hypnotized

182
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,328
Or someone was forced to sign a letter of consent with a knife

183
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,790
It cannot be identified
This is its true meaning, so...

184
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,000
Not considered valid expression of consent

185
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,003
Therefore, it constitutes a violent act

186
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:34,963
That's right

187
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,758
Although there is a written consent

188
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,219
But maybe there is a breakthrough...

189
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,179
What is it?

190
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:44,973
Ms. Xue fell in love at that time

191
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,893
So she is in a weak state

192
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,020
What?

193
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,648
Can't you advocate falling into love
Is it also a state of weak mind?

194
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,403
It's you

195
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,405
Really creative, good Xiaomin

196
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,491
This is the funniest joke I've heard recently

197
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,243
Listen to me

198
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,745
Once a person falls into love, he will inevitably lose his judgment

199
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:08,913
Become irrational

200
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,374
Have you all been in love?

201
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,167
Suppose you go to the beach in winter

202
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,462
The beloved woman said
"If you love me, jump down." Someone will jump, too

203
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,133
Just standing is so cold that it's even more necessary to jump into the sea

204
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,802
No matter how you think, it is not normal or rational, right?

205
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,598
Think back

206
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,727
My girlfriend in high school was a bit perverted

207
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,645
That time she was chewing super juicy chewing gum

208
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,523
Spit the chewed juice into the cup and say

209
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,900
“If you want to date me

210
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,111
Just drank it”

211
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,322
-So I...
-So how are you?

212
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,032
I'll drink it

213
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,241
I'll go

214
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,285
I feel disgusting when I think about it now

215
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,120
But then

216
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,623
I'm in love so I can drink it

217
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,460
Love can make people's mind weak

218
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,920
So unreasonable judgment

219
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,965
Therefore, the agreement made in a weak state of mind

220
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,300
Legally invalid

221
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,844
It can also constitute the crime of injury

222
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,221
This claim sounds ridiculous though

223
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,599
But if you think about it carefully, it seems to make some sense.

224
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,233
No

225
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,528
Are you really going to adopt such a ridiculous claim?

226
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,031
It is to constitute the crime of injury

227
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,742
It is necessary to find a situation that denies the validity of the consent

228
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,496
We have no choice now
I can only think about Lawyer Jiang’s claim

229
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,915
You can also not accept this case

230
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,334
Who doesn't know in the world
Lawyer Yin has outstanding professional skills?

231
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,960
We have so many cases now

232
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,505
Is it really necessary to take on such a case?

233
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,464
This case is interesting

234
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,676
What do you think is the reason why the Anglo-American French system is advanced?

235
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,178
have no idea

236
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,140
The person there tripped over the stone and wanted to sue

237
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,352
Smoking and getting cancer, take the tobacco company to court

238
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,187
In this process

239
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,400
The courts are more diversified
Think more creatively about the law

240
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,987
As the precedents continue to accumulate
The uncertainty of the law is gradually decreasing

241
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:09,367
The predictability of the final law
and the credibility of the judgment has been improved

242
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,078
When encountering problems

243
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,956
People no longer bear it alone

244
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,666
Instead, resort to the law

245
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,293
This is the beginning of the virtuous cycle

246
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:20,920
really

247
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,548
I think it's worth a try, too

248
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,176
True consent must be based on voluntary

249
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,720
If it is due to psychological oppression

250
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,097
It cannot be considered valid

251
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,268
We can check when she agrees
Have you suffered psychological pressure

252
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,980
There is a jurisprudence in the United States
Although the two parties have a voluntary relationship

253
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:44,485
But the woman's claim that her consent is invalid
Because of the psychological and economic pressure from the man

254
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,737
So a lawsuit was filed for rape

255
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,323
Then start pushing forward

256
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:50,908
OK Lawyer Yin

257
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,046
Here it is

258
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,798
Come in quickly

259
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,384
This is a divorce lawsuit entrusted...

260
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,343
Why are you here?

261
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,181
Do you know each other?

262
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,474
haven't seen you for a long time

263
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,518
I'll ask what you are doing?

264
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,688
What's going on?

265
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,402
Sorry, can we talk about it alone?

266
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,033
certainly

267
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,368
no problem

268
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,547
I almost didn't recognize you

269
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,967
If I meet on the street
We'll definitely pass by

270
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,469
Tell the point

271
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,263
I want to divorce him

272
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,431
so what?

273
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,766
I may file a lawsuit

274
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,892
so what?

275
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,394
Please take my case

276
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,354
Going crazy...

277
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,898
-elder sister…
-Who is your "sister"?

278
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,070
Lawyer Xu is the best candidate to represent this case

279
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,114
I'm on a mom forum

280
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,117
I saw someone praise you as the most powerful divorce lawyer

281
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,911
So I checked your information

282
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,289
But at that time I never thought it would be you

283
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,669
When I found out it was you, I planned to give up

284
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,379
But then I thought about it

285
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,549
You should understand me more than anyone else…

286
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,801
How can I understand the mood of a third party?

287
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,804
You're also a victim in that home

288
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,514
Being hurt by that person

289
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,183
I've had the same thing

290
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,729
Self-inflicted by the Heavenly Way

291
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,444
Stop coming again

292
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,115
It's hard for someone to climb up

293
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,200
Don't drag people back into the mud

294
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,492
Really good

295
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,164
Oh my God, look at her

296
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,208
No wonder she is getting fatter

297
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,168
Hello!

298
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,962
This goes on
We will be eaten by you sooner or later and we will go bankrupt. Stop eating!

299
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,381
-What time is it?
-Yes Mom

300

A smell of rice at home

301
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,677
Oh my God, it hurts me

302
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,721
Just because someone like you entered the house

303
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,308
My son is out all day and never comes back!

304
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,436
My poor son

305
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,148
I really don't understand how he fell into the hands of someone like you

306
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,525
Suddenly I got pregnant

307
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:16,030
I also use this as an excuse to tie my son up!

308
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,365
that's all…

Regardless of whether you sign or not

313
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,594
I want her to move in

314
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,305
If you want to stay, stay

315
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,727
I'll do better

316
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,356
Let's not do this

317
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,276
Even for Xiaoxian, don't do this

318
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,736
Don't use me as an excuse

319
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,238
Get a divorce now

320
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,991
I hope you get divorced. That's for my good

What?

324
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,684
What are you thinking? I didn't hear you even shouting?

325
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,644
Nothing What's wrong?

326
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,814
Go to the big conference room to meet
The inauguration ceremony of representative Kwon Nayeon is about to begin

327

right

328
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,775
Let's go

329
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:37,987
quick

But it doesn't matter

334
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,292
Goethe said

You have a goal

338
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,388
It just proves that you have a direction to strive for

339
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,724
If an organization stops striving

340

Achieve sustainable growth

348
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,292
Not socializing, relying on strength

349
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,336
Not relying on human connection

350

Rely on professional qualities

351
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:42,843

Thanks to you I have gained very valuable experience

365
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,933
Unfortunately, time has been a little short

366
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,935
If only you stayed there for a few more years

367
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,896
A good seat should be given to Lawyer Gao

368
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,606
I don't have to

369
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,567
Thanks to Lawyer Gao, I learned a lot

370
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,361
I will definitely work hard to repay you in the future

371
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,487
Yeah?

372
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,947
I'm looking forward to it

373
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,871
You're not an amateur

374
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,915
Don’t you even know who the client is?

375
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,959
Lawyer Quan's client

376
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,295
It's Hiniko Co., Ltd.

377
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,298
Not their representative Li Chengbin personally

378
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:07,344
Of course the company's representative
May confuse yourself with the company

379
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,597
The premise is that he doesn't understand the law

380
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,098
But as a lawyer

381
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,933
How could it be that I didn't know

382
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,103
The company and its representatives are legally

383
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,396
Is it an independent legal entity?

384
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,898
I know

385
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,735
But if Li Chengbin falls, he will be in trouble
Heniko can't save it either

386
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,029
Why do you make that judgment?

387
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,739
represent

388
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:28,324
no

389
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,076
Do you have to reach this point?

390
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,995
This is just technical siege

391
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,706
Representative Li Chengbin did not really move the money away

392
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,166
As long as my legal advice is in place...

393
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,920
We believe there is a conflict of interest in your legal opinion

394
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,964
Since you want to be an agent of Li Chengbin personally

395
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,009
Why not leave Lulin and start your own business in Ruicao Cave

396
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,052
Any agent can be done

397
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,929
No one stops you

398
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,181
Nowadays, those lawyers from Ruicaodong want to expand their scale

399
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,058
Put together the accounting law firm...

400
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,060
(Separation Law Firm
Law firms that independently calculate costs and benefits)

401
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,938
…Author to be a law firm

402
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,481
Why don't you join them?

403
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,982
She must be suitable, right?

404
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:07,905
To kick me out

405
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,032
They will destroy a good company

406
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,202
They can do anything

407
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,496
indeed

408
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,497
Then let's fight tooth for tooth

409
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,040
good

410
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,043
They will definitely take action first

411
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,129
The most urgent thing is to keep Lu Lin

412
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,632
Make structural adjustments first

413
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,133
Just do it

414
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,597
A weak mind?

415
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,140
right

416
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,185
Will love also make people feel weak?

417
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:43,357
Except for claiming that your consent is invalid
We have no other way

418
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,442
But argue this

419
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,570
It must be proved
You lacked the ability to express your intentions at that time

420
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,739
That's it

421
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,117
So we need to ask you a few questions

422
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,576
OK

423
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,621
Do you have a masochistic tendency?

424
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,914
Masturbation tendency?

425
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,542
What is that?

426
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,669
The tendency to be masochistic is

427
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,423
Sexual pleasure occurs when suffering from abuse or pain…

428
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,716
No

429
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,717
I don't have it at all

430
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,928
Who would like that?

431
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,891
Then why did you agree at that time?

432
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,602
I refused at first

433
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,229
result

434
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,940
He said he wanted to break up

435
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,860
So we broke up

436
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,611
But I miss him

437
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,031
Want to do it very much

438
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,492
I didn't hold on for a week, so I called him first

439
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:36,452
But…

440
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,581
He refuses to get back with me

441
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,043
A whole month

442
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,462
I called him like crazy

443
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,464
Find him at home

444
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,425
Tears flowing, big noise

445
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:56,346
The gentle and considerate person who is dedicated to me

446
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,809
I didn't expect there would be such a cold side

447
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,605
Satisfaction and emptiness

448
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,107
I can hardly live a normal life

449
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,696
This took about a month

450
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,907
He'll contact me first

451
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,785
So we got back together

452
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,371
I thought at that time

453
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,166
It seems like I have the whole world

454
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,544
He must have made abusive sexual demands again

455
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,880
Yes

456
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,508
Did you know at that time

457
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,636
You are sensitive to wounds

458
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,513
Scar constitution?

459
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,348
I know

460
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,684
I've dreamed of being a model since I was a kid

461
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,813
So I've been very careful

462
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,065
Even if you are scratched by paper, you are afraid of becoming serious

463
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,568
You mean even if you know this situation
Did you still agree?

464
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,904
I know this sounds crazy

465
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,115
But at that time I...

466
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,952
No choice

467
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,830
When I think of him leaving me again

468
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,542
Just thinking about it makes me feel like I'm dying

469
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,050
Just like what Lawyer Jiang Xiaomin said just now

470
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,053
The possibility of winning this case is slim

471
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,681
If you insist on continuing

472
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,935
We must shape you completely as a victim

473
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,229
A weak and incompetent

474
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,399
Even legal consent
The weak who can't make it

475
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,194
This strategy can cause secondary damage in itself

476
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,156
Do you see me like this?

477
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,907
terribly sorry

478
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,744
I heard your story. That's true

479
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,874
I think it's love that makes you like that

480
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:53,297
You're just like everyone else
Stumbled into a weak state of mind called "Love"

481
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:57,509
Just unfortunately met
A person who exploits this

482
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,261
Lawyer, you...

483
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,930
I mean

484
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,808
People like you

485
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:06,810
Will it become like that?

486
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,147
Yes

487
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,902
How deep love is, how fragile it will become

488
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,905
In the face of love

489
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,075
Everyone will become irrational and weak

490
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,413
So love and fragility are often two sides of the same

491
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,841
-cheers!
-cheers!

492
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,176
Happy birthday

493
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,594
Thanks

494
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,185
We only come to this place for birthdays

495
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,234
What's going on? He's too handsome

496
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,069
real

497
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,737
Look at how many women are around him

498
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,698
If only a few were missing

499
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,117
Go

500
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,452
Kill them instantly

501
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,454
Come on

502
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,831
Handsome guys are usually the source of trouble

503
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,541
Yes

504
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,419
He's more like the type Xiaomin likes

505
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:15,837
What?

506
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,923
You like that type of man

507
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,719
No

508
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,809
Thanks

509
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,815
sorry

510
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:36,858
It doesn't matter

511
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,362
Your wine has spilled

512
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,364
I'll buy you another one

513
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,740
No

514
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,701
I was accidentally

515
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,160
I'm also blamed for not paying attention

516
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,249
Give her two more drinks as this

517
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,501
I want a cup of Jintangli Thank you

518
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,502
OK

519
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,264
Oh My God

520
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,141
What's going on?

521
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,851
No

522
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,315
-Stand here I can do it?
-Okay Thanks

523
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,237
He said he wanted to get it for me

524
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,364
Because I've sprinkled once

525
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,074
Wow, so considerate!

526
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,576
Thank you so much

527
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,369
Please sit

528
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,331
May I?

529
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,211
Did you come alone?

530
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,629
Yes

531
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,215
I just saw a lot of people over you

532
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,803
Isn't it all the way to bars?

533
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,350
-Cheers, let's?
-good

534
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,860
I decided to forget all of that

535
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,153
Yeah?

536
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,782
Wait, what job do you do?

537
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,409
How can you be handsome and humorous

538
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,702
Still so charming?

539
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,037
I'm doing mobile game development

540
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,497
Are you a programmer?

541
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,915
No I am the company representative

542
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,876
Good guy is the representative

543
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,629
Could it be the representative of top companies in the industry?

544
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,798
Which are top companies?

545
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:27,219
Mapur Software, Horizon, Luma Entertainment?

546
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,428
Thank you

547
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,138
The first one is to mention my company

548
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,557
Mapur Software

549
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,517
It's my company

550
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:37,687
What is your name?

551
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,066
Zheng Hanshuo

552
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,028
Who is your ex-boyfriend?

553
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:50,075
Representative of Mabul Software Zheng Hanshuo

554
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,536
Mapur Software

555
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,039
No wonder I know you're not an ordinary person

556
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,251
I've read about you You're amazing

557
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,710
Thanks

558
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,423
Can you talk about yourself?

559
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,382
certainly

560
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,634
My name is Han Xueya, I am a doctor

561
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:09,970
28 years old

562
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,721
I'm two years older than you

563
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,723
We are the same age as three

564
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:14,808
Since elementary school, I've been friends

565
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,852
It turns out you're kids

566
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,314
We started living together in college, so we were roommates too

567
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,692
-So that's it
-Her name is Lee Zhien

568
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,026
Is a lyricist

569
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,278
Yeah?

570
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,487
What songs have you written?

571
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,948
Nothing famous

572
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,075
No more modesty these days

573
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,743
She has written many famous songs

574
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,662
I see

575
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,876
I'm the most curious about you

576
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,589
You are two years younger than me, you should be considered a sister

577
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,048
May I have your name?

578
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,679
Kang Xiao-jin

579
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,722
Kang Xiao-jin

580
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,765
Kang Xiao-jin

581
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,351
What does Miss Xiaomin do?

582
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,147
I…

583
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,773
She is a lawyer

584
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,567
Really?

585
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,902
She is a trump lawyer in a law firm

586
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,614
You don't look like a lawyer

587
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,366
But there is definitely a lawyer's aura

588
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,831
What are you thinking? So trance?

589
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,416
What?

590
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,131
I've just been a lawyer for a few months

591
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,593
There should be no aura

592
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,638
First year of joining? Think about your age, too

593
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,061
Miss Xiaomin

594
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,522
If you put your hair down, it will definitely look better

595
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,193
Let it go and try

596
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,612
Trust me, give it a try

597
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,824
Hold on

598
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,504
Very good looking

599
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,016
(Lu Lin)

600
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,312
Please enter

601
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,108
I'm here too

602
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,068
Please come in soon

603
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,488
The office is really good

604
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,866
Maybe there are few things, it looks so spacious

605
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,076
How do you feel?

606
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,203
I haven't come back to my senses

607
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,290
When I was sent out before
I don't even have my own office

608
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,833
really

609
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,128
Legal affairs for medium-sized companies
How can there be a decent office?

610
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,131
-Sit down
-good

611
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,549
Please check it out

612
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,634
What's this?

613
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,386
It is the information required for structural adjustment

614
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,888
Has been based on personal income or performance in the past five years

615
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,224
Tag the object that needs to be optimized

616
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,686
It seems that most of them are older former lawyers and consultants

617
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,938
Yes, structural adjustment must be completed first...

618
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,358
Ranking of law firms
Isn’t it looking at income generation and the number of lawyers?

619
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,280
The real problem is not
Should these people stay in the law firm

620
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,699
But the salary system is unfair?

621
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,535
Then just make adjustments accordingly

622
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,622
Just change the performance compensation system

623
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,081
That's right

624
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,792
Between salary cuts and layoffs

625
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,836
They should choose to reduce their salary

626
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:34,591
What they really care about is social status and sense of belonging

627
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,134
What really needs to leave

628
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,553
Not them

629
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,555
But there is someone else

630
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,521
exist?

631
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,815
senior

632
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,234
Please enter

633
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,403
(Jin Lucheng)

634
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,363
wrong

635
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,616
You are now a management partner
I have to be more formal

636
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,618
It's better to be the same as before

637
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,953
In the eyes of my seniors, I'm afraid I'll always be a newcomer

638
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,705
What are you talking about?

639
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,748
How is that possible?

640
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,333
Come and sit down. Representative

641
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,091
You want to know

642
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,844
Why did Brother Shengzhe take you
Pushing the position of management partner

643
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,472
You were obviously excluded from office politics before

644
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:23,932
Yes

645
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,102
You have known Representative Gao for a long time

646
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,270
I think what you might know

647
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,567
I have indeed been following Brother Shengzhe since college

648
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,070
But I still can't fully understand his thoughts

649
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,739
But there is one thing to be sure

650
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,908
He looks at people not only at the person himself

651
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,161
It depends on how big the person can make

652
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:47,205
Splash?

653
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,457
He lets you sit in this seat

654
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,501
Not just for you to make a splash

655
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,129
I'll borrow this power from you

656
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,172
Ultimately defeated the outdated structure

657
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,507
He never waves his sword himself

658
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,843
Just calculate where the knife will fall

659
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,222
Wouldn't this be too risky?

660
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,475
A better understanding of politics

661
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,186
A person who is easier to manipulate should be more suitable than me, right?

662
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,107
But that kind of person can't break the situation

663
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,735
They are too smooth and will only be assimilated by the old pattern

664
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,822
In my opinion, you're not a knife
But the one who swung the knife

665
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,283
A person who can swing his sword the way he does

666
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,703
So just follow the way of Kwon Nayeon

667
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,455
Swipe the knife in a cool way

668
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,624
May I?

669
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,588
(Li Xu Law Firm)

670
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,592
“In view of the invalidity of consent, it shall constitute the crime of injury”

671
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:42,927
It's really OK

672
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,388
Is this worth responding to?

673
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,057
What's this

674
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,059
We shouldn't lose the case on the legal level

675
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,104
But the content is too allergic
I'm afraid it will cause public opinion storm

676
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,105
really

677
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,650
Can't make my personal habit
Become someone else’s gossip

678
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,738
We will arrange for both lawyers to meet

679
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,531
Try to reconcile as much as possible

680
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,783
Just do that

681
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,661
I'm really sorry, I'll bother you even if I'm going to do this kind of private matter

682
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,498
It's okay, don't say that

683
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,334
Zheng represents you are Mabul Software
Mapur software is you

684
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,711
This type of personal litigation has never been just a private matter

685
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,797
IPO is imminent and any negative public sentiment must be eliminated

686
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,089
(IPO: The company's first stock listing)

687
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,094
Who is the plaintiff's agent?

688
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,472
Yoon Seok-hoon and Kang Hyo-min of Lu Lin

689
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,016
Jiang Xiao-sin?

690
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,976
Are you talking about Jiang Xiaomin?

691
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,019
right

692
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,562
Show me the complaint

693
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,653
What's wrong?

694
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,322
interesting

695
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,204

Lawyer Jiang Xiaomin?

702
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,805
What are you doing?

703
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,473
exist

704
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,935
The idea that love makes people weak
Are you ready?

705
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,603
smoothly

706
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,689
Think carefully

707
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,108
I will

708
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,528
-If nothing else, just come here
-good

Lawyer Yin

710
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,953
I definitely don't want to compare with other groups

711
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,831
But antitrust and financial groups

712
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,584
Have had three meals

713
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,422
Don't we get together once?

I have important work today, leave it to you

This is our first dinner party after all
Let's go together

717
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,643
If work permits, I will definitely go

718
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,811
OK Thanks

719
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,563
Is there a limit on dinner parties?

720
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,772
Of course not

721
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,528
You really have it!

722
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,790
(Successful payment of 760,000 won, no menu cuisine)

723

(Yong Seok-hoon)

725
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,615
OK, drive to the door

726
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,574
good

727
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,005
(Jiang Xiaomin: Are you not good at it?)

728
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,132
(Jiang Xiaomin: You are not here?)

729

(Jiang Xiaomin: Did you come here?)

730
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,927
How much did they drink?

731
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:25,108
(Pay successfully 260,000 won, Bell Beer House)

732
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,401
Good guy, I can drink it

Secretary Huang

734
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,238
Is Beer House nearby?

735

We're going to pass there soon

736
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,533
Just drive there

737
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,492
OK

738
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:43,418
Why doesn’t Xu Minzhen answer the phone?

739
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,338
Even if you are busy, you should come to have a dinner party

740

Driver!

750
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,533
Leave?

751
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,702
Do you want to take a taxi?

752
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,620
It's Yoon Seok-hoon

753
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:20,955
Lawyer Yin!

754
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,291
How did you come?

755
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,919
Do you know how long we have been waiting for you?

756
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:30,006
I got it. Get in the car

757
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,132
I'll take you home

758
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,426
Secretary Huang asked her to take the co-driver

759
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,594
good

760
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,095
Too bad

761
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,014
I'll do it myself

762
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,187
Is it okay?

763
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,232
Ouch

764
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,528
She doesn't want this head anymore

765
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,697
I'm fine...

766
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,544
Have some water

767
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,047
Thanks

768
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,426
Drink in small sips or you will vomit

769
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,095
good

770
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,019
Are you okay?

771
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,604
I'm fine

772
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:29,398
Give

773
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,819
Thanks

774
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,033
This is the third handkerchief

775
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,748
Lawyer Yin

776
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,959
Which perfume do you use?

777
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,419
Very good smell

778
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,636
I saw the pharmacy. Please stop.

779
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:00,930
good

780
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,785
(Anming Pharmacy)

781
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,997
Take one pill

782
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,166
Drink with this

783
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,126
good

784
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:32,628
Lost your composure

785
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:33,921
Too out of character

786
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,467
Too out of character Jiang Xiaomin!

787
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,297
What's wrong?

788
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,300
What's wrong? What happened?

789
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,845
Sister, why are you here?

790
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,016
I knew you would come here

791
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,976
You know you'll be stupid

792
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,145
You tossed me so last night

793
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,313
Do I have it?

794
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,608
Go and take a shower, I'll take a shower after exercise

795
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,068
Where is my clothes?

796
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,862
Put it there

797
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,496
What did I do last night?

798
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,832
Death headache

799
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,123
What does your look mean?

800
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,418
What's wrong with me?

801
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,342
We are sacred and pure colleagues

802
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,429
Stop giving me a man's set

803
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,347
What are you talking about?

804
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:49,890
I'm a man

805
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,476
I'm going to wash, you heat up the soup and drink it

806
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,020
Can't I give it to me?

807
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,273
no problem

808
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,612
Very delicious

809
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,368
Don't you come some?

810
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,536
I don't have breakfast

811
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,038
That's it

812
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,165
But you happen to have dried Mingtai fish soup?

813
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,959
What a joke?

814
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,003
I've been through last night

815
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,796
It's for you

816
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,758
I feel like a married man

817
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,426
Really...

818
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,803
By the way

819
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,139
What happened last night?

820
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,307
really

821
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,351
Of course you don't remember

822
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,269
(Xu Minzhen)

823
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,228
She answered the phone

824
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,982
Xu Minzhen Where are you?

825
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,692
Come quickly!

826
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,862
You make a big fuss

827
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,489
I'm gone, you're drunk and unconscious

828
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,450
By the way, why did you change your home password?

829
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,496
Tell me earlier if you change

830
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,498
Sorry, I'm sorry

831
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,042
My sister always sends me home

832
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,585
This is the first time I've been to your house

833
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,337
By the way

834
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,173
There is a photo next to the bedside, who is that person?

835
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,258
Which one?

836
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,219
that is

837
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,721
A large size woman

838
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,223
That's me

839
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,017
-What?
-It's me

840
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,478
When is that?

841
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,940
About seven years ago I was thirty-five or six years old

842
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,323
You look much younger now

843
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,324
-Yes?
-right

844
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,118
Self-management is important

845
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,994
-really
-Yes

846
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,626
Who was the lady who came to the law firm that day?

847
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,378
Which one?

848
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,630
She's here to entrust a divorce lawsuit, but you refused

849
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,674
Lawyer Kim Rusung has been talking about it

850
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,426
Say you rejected a client

851
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,344
Do you know her?

852
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,512
She is my husband's mistress

853
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,472
oops!

854
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,932
Really

855
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,435
There are so many things

856
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,436
Give

857
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,312
Thanks

858
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,234
To be precise, it's the ex-husband

859
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:09,530
The mistress comes to me and wants to divorce my ex-husband

860
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,242
I'm so shocked

861
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,702
Heartbeats very fast

862
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,495
What shocked?

863
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,955
Because I'm divorced?

864
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,999
Or is my ex-husband cheating?

865
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:23,043
Or is the mistress actually having the courage to come to me?

866
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,086
All are!

867
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,381
But the most shocking thing is

868
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,591
It's probably your sister, you've been married

869
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,010
-I still have children
-child?

870
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,095
-The children are 20 years old
-What?

871
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,765
Could it be that you are interested in me?

872
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,229
Where does this start?

873
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,314
Stop teasing me

874
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,816
Why are you so responsive?

875
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,735
Are you serious?

876
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,819
real

877
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,824
We almost worked together for three years

878
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,118
The lunch boxes I ate together can be paved to Busan

879
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,369
For such a long time...

880
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,121
I've never mentioned my past

881
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,373
No?

882
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,752
Why do I feel that I know you well?

883
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,003
That's right

884
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,379
You just don't know my past

885
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,006
Your past...

886
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:13,260
If I were to say that I am now, no one knows me better than you

887
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,346
Do you feel better now?

888
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,514
Not

889
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,849
Let's go when you're full

890
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:19,892
etc.

891
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,810
Tell me everything you have in the past

892
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:23,771
From what age to start?

893
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,773
Start with what you remember

894
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,110
The brain is running at full speed

895
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,321
I'm really not kidding

896
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,995
You mean

897
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,706
Love makes people feel weak?

898
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:48,546
Suppose half of the people in the country are in love

899
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:53,050
Wouldn’t all the contracts signed by these half of the people be invalid?

900
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,011
Really convinced

901
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,311
Representative Zheng Hanshuo from Mabul Software is here

902
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,064
- Invite him in
-good

903
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,366
What does it mean?

904
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,493
Come and have a look after get off work today

905
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,287
So please sit

906
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,756
Don't worry about me, you guys keep going

907
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,845
In short, we do not agree with the claim of the complaint

908
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:41,765
Isn't this just using our client
Social reputation as a well-known entrepreneur

909
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,809
Are you threatening in disguise under the pretext of legal forms?

910
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:44,852
Pay attention to your words

911
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,936
"threaten"?

912
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,648
One party pursues one-sided sexual pleasure

913
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:52,735
Causes the other party to irreversible damage

914
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,114
What exactly does your client want?

915
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,908
Please see these photos These scars...

916
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,910
I don't like to be verbose

917
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,413
What does she want?

918
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,165
Criminal Penalties and Compensation for Damage

919
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,378
This material

920
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,964
Was it written by Lawyer Jiang?

921
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:18,719
Yes

922
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,095
According to the victim's statement...

923
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,096
"victim"?

924
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:22,723
Who is the victim?

925
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,601
Lawyers shouldn't use words so rudely

926
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,977
She's the accuser

927
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,562
Complaint is everyone's right

928
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,148
According to the accuser’s statement…

929
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,734
You mean I'm like picking prey

930
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,778
Deliberately approaching Xue Yinying

931
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,238
Take advantage of my superior appearance and social status

932
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,407
Use some psychological tactic to brainwash her
Carry out mental manipulation

933
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:44,036
Causing her weak mind
So any consent she made

934
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,496
All are invalid?

935
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,123
So should I be convicted of injury and compensation?

936
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,334
-Yes
-Artificial Nights

937
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,418
Still third-rate

938
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,343
I want to talk to Lawyer Jiang alone
You guys go out first, okay?

939
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,138
Why? What's going on?

940
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,808
Is there anything wrong?

941
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,270
What's the specific thing

942
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,231
I'll tell Lawyer Jiang

943
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,280
Why do you have this expression?

944
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,907
I won't hurt her

945
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,075
What did he say?

946
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,828
By the way

947
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,103
Very good looking

948
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,819
I said you put your hair down and look better

949
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,205
Do you know Representative Zheng?

950
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,751
I met him a few days ago at a bar

951
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,004
I want to know his character
May be helpful

952
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,381
So I had a brief chat

953
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,635
Are you saying you were deliberately approaching him?

954
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,178
To mine useful information?

955
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,888
Not intentional

956
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,431
Do you even understand the professional ethics of lawyers?

957
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,683
Article 45 of "Lawyer Ethics Code"

958
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,479
Prohibited and existing agents
The other party directly negotiates

959
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,689
How could you do a third-rate lawyer?

960
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,107
Third-rate?

961
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:21,235
For third-rate

962
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,446
Establish close relationships with the other party in the case

963
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,490
Violating professional ethics

964
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,493
Lawyer without professional ethics
What is it not a "third-rate"?

965
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,120
I have no close relationship with him

966
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,330
So what was that just now?

967
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,665
Not what you thought

968
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,584
Then you will obey it completely
Is "Lawyer Ethical Code"?

969
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,544
Kang Xiao-sin!

970
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:42,714
I told you to be careful

971
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,816
("Magic Way")

972
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,782
(Contact person)

973
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,117
(Kang Xiao-sin)

974
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,412
The number you called cannot be connected now

975
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,039
Really...

976
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,013
Hello, I am Jiang Xiaomin

977
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,431
It's me

978
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,349
I use an office phone

979
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:35,851
You seem to have blocked my private number

980
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:37,811
What do you want?

981
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,855
Do you know Zheng Hanshuo privately?

982
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,607
What does it have to do with you?

983
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,150
How did you meet?

984
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,736
Why did he treat you that way?

985
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,070
Why touch you like that?

986
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,656
Lawyer Han

987
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:53,160
Is it really appropriate for us to talk about these?

988
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,664
Where are you?

989
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,417
Meet

990
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,711
Nothing good to see

991
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:05,964
Takatoshi

992
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,483
Really

993
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,168
(Lawyer Jiang Xiaomin)

994
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,672
Hello Lawyer Jiang

995
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,757
Say it

996
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,761
I still have a job, I'll go back to the office

997
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,639
good

998
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:39,850
OK

999
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:57,909
Why not tell me?

1000
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,871
I didn't know you were the other party's attorney that day

1001
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,414
I'm afraid I've said something I shouldn't say

1002
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:04,958
Not so pleasant in a long time

1003
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,712
There is a kind of intellectual stimulation and emotional satisfaction

1004
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,257
Sexual satisfaction can be said

1005
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:14,885
terribly sorry

1006
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,679
I should tell you that I am Ms. Xue’s agent

1007
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,932
I didn't mean to hide it, just...

1008
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,017
Just what?

1009
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:25,562
Chat with me. Want to find something that is beneficial to you?

1010
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,191
I won't care

1011
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:31,610
I like you

1012
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,403
Please don't make things complicated

1013
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,738
What do I do?

1014
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,907
If I want to simplify complex things

1015
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,283
What should be done?

1016
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,954
I have to solve this problem first, right?

1017
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:46,708
In this way, there will be no conflict of interest between us

1018
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,211
Does Yinying want compensation?

1019
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,296
Yes

1020
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,264
Fill in the amount

1021
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,808
I accept any amount you fill

1022
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,315
I didn't know what kind of physique she had at the time

1023
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:11,858
I am anxious

1024
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:17,948
You should tell her your feelings in person

1025
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:18,907
No

1026
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,743
I'm not worried about her

1027
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,287
What will Miss Xiaomin think of me

1028
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,665
This is what I'm worried about

1029
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,291
I'm not a pervert, nor a sadistic

1030
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,127
That's just a common couple

1031
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,671
Normal expression of interest

1032
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:36,466
Just her skin

1033
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,844
Not very similar to others

1034
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,556
I want to date Miss Xiaomin

1035
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,141
I'll pretend I didn't hear this

1036
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,852
-I didn't mean to do what now
-Representative Zheng

1037
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,149
Let her fill in the amount on the check

1038
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,984
Sign a confidentiality agreement again

1039
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,195
For the sake of Lawyer Jiang
I can tolerate it, but that's it

1040
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,948
If you get more and more

1041
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,284
Did she really agree?

1042
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,412
People can judge by themselves through video

1043
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,207
video?

1044
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,251
It seems Yinying didn't tell you

1045
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,128
I have a video

1046
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,965
Of course, she agreed to the filming.

1047
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:23,722
I'll contact you

1048
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:38,945
video?

1049
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,238
Yes

1050
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:44,618
I don't know I should go to the client
To what extent

1051
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,912
I didn't think about it before

1052
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:47,871
sorry

1053
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,544
Why do you think the client filed this lawsuit?

1054
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,757
Because of harm

1055
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,135
So want compensation?

1056
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,386
More important than the body is emotion

1057
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,307
Lawyer Jiang

1058
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,852
Do you know why I asked you to join my team?

1059
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,145
Because I am the number one in the class?

1060
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,022
Because I look smart?

1061
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,024
no

1062
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,403
Because you understand the nature of litigation

1063
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,991
Many kinds of love

1064
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,994
Have the opposite sex, the same sex
Mother's love, father's love, respect and love

1065
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:31,164
Brotherhood, friendship, comradeship
Fraternity and self-love

1066
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,916
Love can hurt people

1067
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,544
Once the pain reaches its extreme
People will consider resorting to the law

1068
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,589
At the verge of despair
They believe that litigation is the last resort

1069
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,009
Believe it can protect your happiness
Protect your right to pursue happiness

1070
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,012
I want to be an agent for someone like this

1071
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,182
Because it's very interesting?

1072
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,102
you're right

1073
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,814
When people reach the extreme of pain
Will consider resorting to law

1074
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,775
At the verge of despair

1075
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:03,446
They believe that litigation is the last resort
Believe it can protect your happiness

1076
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,407
Protect your right to pursue happiness

1077
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,785
I believe Ms. Xue is the same too

1078
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,122
If encounter
A client who wants to heal his scars through litigation

1079
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,833
You have to see what's under the scar

1080
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:22,340
Winning or monetary compensation may not be the only comfort

1081
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,426
clear

1082
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,262
The confidentiality agreement sent by the other party is probably only one-way

1083
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:28,972
It should be

1084
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,058
I guess they broke up like that

1085
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:37,856
Change the confidentiality agreement to two-way

1086
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,858
Then show it to the client

1087
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,151
Two-way?

1088
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,655
I see

1089
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,825
Did he really say that?

1090
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,911
Did you really agree with him shooting the video?

1091
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,371
That's...

1092
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:55,832
At that time...

1093
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,337
Then this is it

1094
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,630
The confidentiality agreement they want

1095
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,883
Just one-way constraints on you

1096
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,635
We changed it to two-way
In turn, propose to the other party

1097
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,179
That way he can't leak the video...

1098
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,098
He's not the kind of person who leaks videos

1099
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,809
Even so, it is better to have legal constraints

1100
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,146
That's safer, right?

1101
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,940
Also regarding the compensation...

1102
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,401
I just want the actual amount spent

1103
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,403
Treatment fees and attorney fees

1104
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,323
Then why are you...

1105
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,700
I'm not filing a lawsuit for money

1106
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,996
But I don't know either

1107
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,956
Why do this

1108
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,210
He unilaterally informed him to break up

1109
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,671
This alone is already hard to accept

1110
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:48,426
What's more, I'm the only one who left such a deep scar

1111
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,720
Feeling unfair

1112
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:54,474
I even lost my job because of this

1113
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,810
But he still has a smooth flow

1114
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:01,314
So I feel like I have to do something

1115
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,151
During my love period, I was always led by him

1116
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:09,364
I want to get rid of that helplessness, too

1117
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,869
I don't need money now

1118
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:19,666
What tortures me the most is actually self-blame

1119
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,212
But you said before, love can also make people weak

1120
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,673
This made me realize
It's not because I'm not good enough that I'm injured

1121
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,385
Anyone who falls into love can become like that

1122
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,430
Your words...

1123
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,184
Give me comfort

1124
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:43,690
I hope the scars in your heart will not turn into keloids

1125
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:48,361
After love ends, there will inevitably be scars in your heart

1126
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:53,450
But I hope it won't hurt all the time

1127
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,202
good

1128
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:00,248
Just like the confidentiality agreement needs to be changed to two-way

1129
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,876
Breakup should be two-way

1130
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,045
right

1131
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,131
Say goodbye in a cool way

1132
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:12,760
Just keep the last look in memory

1133
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,893
OK I will

1134
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,063

Zheng Hanshuo

1140
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,138
Let's talk a few words

1141
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,027
Do you have to make a fuss like this?

1142
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:13,488
Too tiring

1143
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,370
You've said that before

1144
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,039
If you make me a demon, you can forget me

1145
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,083
It's up to you but

1146
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,834
If you want to do this

1147
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,921
You're thinking quietly at home alone

1148
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:31,881
I won't make you a demon

1149
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:33,841
and

1150
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,596
I won't distort the good times we have

1151
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,475
Even if you change your mind now

1152
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,520
I won't doubt your true feelings at that time.

1153
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,772
Not that I believe you

1154
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:49,899
But I believe in myself

1155
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:56,906
Because I'm a very attractive woman
Enough to make a man like you...

1156
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,451
Truly fall for me

1157
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,803
Want to go back to the law firm? I'll give it to you

1158
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,805
No, you go by yourself

1159
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,766
Things have been resolved

1160
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,518
Can we meet?

1161
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,895
You're not the type I like

1162
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,981
Playing hard to get is also a pleasure

1163
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,734
You really live in your own world

1164
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:37,030
I really hope love needs a certificate

1165
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,116
That way there will be no one like you

1166
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,160
Treat lofty feelings as tools to satisfy your selfish desires

1167
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,497
A perfect and comprehensive woman like Miss Xiaomin

1168
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,207
I don't know how to enjoy life

1169
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:49,834
Too regretful

1170
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,712
You are the one who really missed something

1171
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:56,674
A restrained and elegant heart can broaden the spectrum of emotions

1172
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:00,637
At the end of the spectrum, there are things you don't know

1173
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,223
That's a feeling you can never understand

1174
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,060
That's a real regret

1175
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,109
What a pity

1176
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:45,973

1177

(Application for confirmation of divorce intention)

1178
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:25,638
good

1179
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,517
Let's get divorced

1180
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,232
but

1181
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,194
Let me take care of hash for at least one day a week

1182
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,239
good

1183
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,742
I will continue to make perfume and soap for me

1184
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,286
good

1185
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,123
You will never use it

1186
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,659
"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

1187
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,828
This is the performance compensation system to be implemented

1188
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,580
How long have you been in office

1189
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:59,292
No consensus was reached
Just change the incentive system without authorization?

1190
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,210
The act of squeezing salary-giving lawyers by taking cases at low prices

1191
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,421
When will we indulge ourselves?

1192
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,464
Do I want me to dig up some Yoon Seok-hoon’s black material?

1193
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:07,967
I've found someone to do it. Let's wait

1194
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,970
The defendant has been filed with criminal charges by his wife

1195
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,930
And was charged with suicide help

1196
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,725
I don't need a lawyer. I plead guilty and surrender

1197
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,643
This is thanks to you

1198
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,270
-How long will you play?
-I was scared!

1199
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,398
Please ask the court to convict the defendant

1200
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,650
Can you meet now?
