00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,953
"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

2
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,123
This is where I treasure

3
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,211
-I wish I could stay here for one day
- Really amazing

4
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,879
Wait a moment

5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,675
This is not what Xu Yuanmei painter
"Meet the Body"?

6
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,468
A person who knows what he knows about

7
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:58,058
Having said that this one is covered with cloth
What is the origin of the work?

8
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,521
This is my most cherished work. It must be preserved.

9
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,731
careful…

10
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,443
You know the Korean celebrity artists who have become popular recently

11
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,903
Is Liu Guanmo painter?

12
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,155
I know I've seen him on the news

13
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,740
He's super famous

14
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,951
He graduated from a top art school in the United States

15
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,536
He also held a painting exhibition at the Malte Art Museum

16
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,081
The Malte Gallery
Chelsea's oldest exhibition hall

17
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,417
Only famous artists
Only then are eligible to hold an exhibition there

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,295
I've put a lot of effort into it
I bought his work

19
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,338
How much?

20
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,300
Three hundred million won?

21
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,509
-Three hundred million?
- Can't believe it

22
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,178
What does a painting with 300 million won look like?

23
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,972
Then next

24
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:41,018
The "Celebration" by Liu Guanmo painter is released immediately

25
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,571
Are you kidding?

26
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,032
-What's the meaning?
-How much does it cost?

27
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,950
Three hundred million?

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,037
Are you crazy?

29
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:01,580
What nerves do you have?

30
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,206
Listen

31
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,292
I have this painting at home, too

32
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,046
-What?
-I have such a painting at home, too

33
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,967
Yezhen, stop lying

34
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:14,926
I lie?

35
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,270
-Hey Mom
-Yezhen

36
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,648
-Are you at home?
-exist

37
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,567
Can we take a look at the painting in the master bedroom?

38
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,402
Of course, you can wait for me

39
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,122
Thank you mom, I'll hang up first

40
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,126
I don't know who is lying

41
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,212
You said you spent 300 million to buy this painting?

42
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,255
I'm so laughing

43
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,841
My painting was before at the flea market

44
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,051
Bought for 100,000 won

45
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,515
What? Hundred thousand won?

46
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,558
That's a fake

47
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,061
It's a replica of this painting

48
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,979
That's probably true

49
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,774
Someone may be in the flea market
Selling imitations of "Celebration"

50
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,069
Isn’t there a creation date in this corner?

51
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,240
September 2024 is 6 months ago

52
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,991
So what?

53
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,119
I bought that painting a year ago

54
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,455
What?

55
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,502
This one in your hand is a fake

56
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,922
Ruiying, you haven't changed at all

57
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,634
Remember? In junior high school
I can tell you're wearing fake shoes

58
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,469
You still don't admit it

59
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,597
We went to the store to ask
The clerk confirms that the shoes are fake

60
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,766
So funny

61
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,395
Have you not changed this problem yet?

62
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,606
I heard you're lying

63
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,568
I made a lot of money by changing clothes in the wholesale market

64
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,319
I thought you didn't do that.

65
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,530
But now it seems

66
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,699
Still difficult to move nature

67
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,494
Change the tag?

68
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,122
Be careful

69
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't talk nonsense here

70
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,003
What if yours is a fake?

71
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,381
Although this possibility is slim
But if that's the case

72
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,509
I'm right behind my neck

73
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,387
Tamed "I'm a fake"

74
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,516
But if this one is fake, you have to tattoo it

75
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,603
"Fake Madman"

76
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,273
-What?
-how?

77
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:34,941
Scared?

78
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,486
Not afraid

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,488
I'm not afraid at all

80
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,199
Very good, one word is determined

81
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,701
Did you hear it?

82
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,952
- Heard
-Um

Chapter 5: Salieri's Monologue

84
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,222
I am pregnant

85
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,224
It's been six months

86
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,147
I'm sorry if I scare you

87
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,900
I haven't found a chance to tell you

88
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,611
How do you...

89
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,240
How can you do this?

90
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,826
How could I tell you that I don't want children

91
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,537
Turning around but having a child with Yuanjun?

92
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,915
I've changed my mind

93
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,419
Such a big thing, "change your mind"

94
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,047
That's it?

95
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,549
Because this is the fact

96
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,051
Nearly forty years old

97
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,806
My attitude towards having a baby has changed

98
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,434
Don't take it on yourself. It has nothing to do with you.

99
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,811
Has nothing to do with me?

100
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,021
When I was 20 or 30 years old

101
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,482
I just want to focus on myself

102
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,322
I believe you will become a good father, too

103
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,202
If you're still by my side

104
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,830
Then I will be your child

105
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,673
I've always felt guilty about what happened before

106
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,093
It's me one-sided

107
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,388
Deprived you of the opportunity to become a father

108
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,600
By the way, there is perfume

109
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,102
The baby doesn't seem to like that taste

110
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,938
I've had a lot of morning sickness lately

111
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,066
So I sent you the perfume I made for six months at a time

112
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,903
I'll make new for you after the baby is born

113
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,335
(Li Xu Law Firm)

114
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,336
(Conference Room 3)

115
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,755
Let's summarize

116
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,591
Ms. Li Ruiying is priced at 300 million won

117
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,927
Purchased your work "Celebration"

118
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,554
But Ms. Wong Ye-jin claimed
Before the creation of "Celebration" is completed

119
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,016
I bought the same painting for 100,000 won

120
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,645
So Ms. Li Ruiying

121
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,980
On the grounds of fraud and copyright violation
File a lawsuit against you

122
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,733
But she said that as long as the court decides

123
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,320
The painting she bought is a true story
Huang Yizhen bought a fake

124
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,530
She will cancel all lawsuits

125
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,616
Yes, I've lived until now...

126
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,119
Never received

127
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,665
This humiliation

128
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,960
Not only counterfeit my works

129
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,296
Not selling in the gallery
It's actually sold at a flea market

130
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,299
And it only sold 100,000 won

131
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,762
I've suffered such a great humiliation

132
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,931
Bastard thief...

133
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,642
I must let this guy be completely finished

134
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:01,200
Please take all possible legal measures

135
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,607
OK

136
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,402
hateful

137
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,162
It seems to be the main building

138
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,206
Isn't it a new building?

139
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,126
Maybe it's indigestion, I want to vomit

140
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,878
Go and have a checkup, the doctor is not a bad move

141
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,005
What to check

142
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,799
-We have to go to the new building
-right

143
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,801
- Just take some digestive tablets
-Wait me a moment

144
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,511
Excuse me

145
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,639
This is the new building

146
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,016
Where are you going?

147
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,853
Registration office

148
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,066
Take a left turn here and arrive

149
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,903
-She knows sign language
-Your sign language is amazing

150
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,321
Thanks

151
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,871
When did you learn sign language?

152
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,122
Do you usually go to church?

153
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,623
What?

154
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,126
Many people learn sign language in church

155
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,086
I'm not

156
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,839
A long story

157
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,050
What's the meaning? Where did you learn it?

158
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,138
Oh my God you scared me

159
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,891
What's wrong?

160
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,353
("Introduction to Korean Sign Language")

161
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,942
Do you want me to read all this book and teach you sign language?

162
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,986
-Um
-Why should I do this?

163
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,073
Because I have dyslexia, I can't read it myself

164
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,616
-so what?
-so

165
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,786
I want you to read the book first and then teach me sign language

166
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,371
I'm in my senior year

167
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,539
Me too

168
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,874
Although it's the third time

169
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,043
I mean why you suddenly

170
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,212
Want to learn sign language?

171
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,214
She wants to see her twin sister

172
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,174
Want to communicate with your sister

173
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,927
I've always wanted to see her again

174
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,429
I always feel like seeing her

175
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,474
This spell can be unlocked

176
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,602
I'm talking about dyslexia

177
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:19,452
Sister, I'm so happy to see you
We finally meet, I miss you very much

178
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,833
do you remember me?

179
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,590
Are you sure you were not teaching it wrong?

180
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,718
Of course that's right

181
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,762
My sister doesn't seem to understand

182
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,890
Could you learn English sign language

183
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,226
Instead of Korean sign language, right?

184
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,771
Just talk directly

185
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,732
I'll read lip words, too

186
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,366
So that's the case?

187
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,869
Yes, then I knew

188
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,747
Hearing impaired people don't necessarily know only sign language

189
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,585
Xiaomin's sister can sign language and read lips

190
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,044
What is lip reading?

191
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,090
It is by observing the movement of lips
How to understand the other person's words

192
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,179
I understand, read lips...

193
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,306
(Information Room)

194
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,979
(The plaintiff's claim is the essence)

195
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,652

198
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,122
(Defendant: Wen Zhenhui)

199
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,921
Sister, what is this?

200
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,053
It was a complaint received by a friend of mine
It looks serious

201
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,015
Can my genius lawyer sister help her see?

202
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,101
OK

203
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,937
I'll reply to you after reading it

204
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,150
(Dispute for damages)

205
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,109
(Plaintiff: Liu Guanmo)

206
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,866
(Plaintiff's Attorney: Li Xu Law Firm
Han Shengzan Min Sula)

207
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,252
Isn’t the plaintiff Liu Guanmo a very famous painter?

208
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,796
And his law firm is Li Xu

209
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,339
It seems that the situation is serious

210
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,925
It's been so long since I delivered
Why are you sending it now?

211
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,679
She's still young

212
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,807
The first time I've received this kind of thing
Just threw it on the table

213
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,810
I found out today, so I will forward it to you immediately

214
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,982
(Defendant: Wen Zhenhui, copyright infringement, etc.)

215

216
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,947
(Wen Zhenhui)

217
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,367
(Date of verdict)

218
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,081
The verdict date is set at 2:00 this afternoon

219
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,667
What is that?

220
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,920
The complaint has been delivered
But she did not submit a defense letter within 30 days

221
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,215
Didn't appear in court either
So the court directly set the verdict date

222
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,675
It's today

223
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,012
so what? Is it serious?

224
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,224
If this continues, the plaintiff will win the case without a debate

225
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,936
Then the defendant will be your friend Zhenhui

226
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,980
Only appeals can be addressed

227
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,693
Although I don't know the details
But it seems that the situation is not good for her?

228
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,029
Yes, she must go to court immediately

229
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,614
Date of judgment for revocation of no debate

230
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,785
Can you help her?

231
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,955
Of course, it's your friend after all

232
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,916
Thank you Xiaomin

233
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,965
(Court)

234
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,217
Confirmed Power of Attorney has been submitted

235
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,762
The original verdict date is now decided to be cancelled

236
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,348
Thank you, Presiding Judge

However, the plaintiff in this case Mr. Liu Guanmo

238

Criminal cases involving the same dispute are under trial

I'm afraid I can't give you too much time

240

Lawyer Jiang

251
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,820
How could you not discuss with your seniors
Just take the case without authorization

252
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,447
The situation is urgent and she is my sister's friend...

253
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,949
Have you forgotten?

254
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,535
You missed for no reason last time
Go to investigate city gas theft

255
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,828
I'll clean up the mess for you

256
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,080
But in the end things were not resolved smoothly...

257
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,916
sorry

258
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,336
What about the agency fee?

259
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,130
Can't be a public welfare agent?

260
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,381
(Free legal services)

261
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,341
That needs to be approved specifically

262
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,343
You're killing me

263
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,846
Even if it is approved

264
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,556
There is only one week, how do you plan to prepare for the trial?

265
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,807
Have you been to court?

266
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,976
The last contactless traffic accident case

267
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,395
On the debate preparation day I...

268
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,356
You just talked about defense strategies in front of the judge

269
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,401
Never experienced a court showdown with real swords and guns

270
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,612
Yes, I have no experience in court

271
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,072
You must be very proud

272
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,576
Wait a minute, damn...

273
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,329
If it is a public welfare agency case
Then it will be guided by lawyer Hong Daoyun

274
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,124
-What?
-You last time you called him in person

275
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,668
He must be still holding a grudge.

276
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,006
Let's discuss it with Lawyer Yin first

277
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,340
-hurry up
-good

278
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,848
So when is the court held?

279
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,725
Next Wednesday

280
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,729
Only one week left to prepare I'm really worried

281
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,522
You keep making trouble since the first day you come in

282
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,984
-sorry
-here we go again

283
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,821
How do you plan to defend? Have confidence?

284
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,741
No

285
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,451
Who is the plaintiff's agent?

286
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,077
Li Xu

287
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,162
Li Xu?

288
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,207
The plaintiff is an internationally renowned painter Liu Guanmo

289
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,750
It's not surprising that Li Xu can afford it

290
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,752
Is the former lawyer hired?

291
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,255
No, a partner
And several paid lawyers...

292
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,925
Three…

293
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,803
I can't do anything about you after making such a big mistake

294
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,514
I'll deal with the administrative side

295
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,600
But you are ready to handle the court debate yourself
You have to take responsibility for the result

296
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,809
Go out

297
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,437
yes

298
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,369
Should I arrange mock court trial training?

299
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,579
Lawyer Hong Daoyun is responsible for public welfare agency cases

300
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,457
He would sit next to Lawyer Jiang during the trial

301
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,501
If Lawyer Jiang makes a slight mistake

302
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,170
He will definitely take the opportunity to drive her out

303
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,839
Just thinking about it makes a headache

304
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,384
She's speechless

305
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,473
Should she practice court debate?

306
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,434
You go and arrange it

307
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,103
OK I'll do it now

308
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,356
This guy is really

309
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,860
(Good job! Jiang Xiaomin)

310
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,488
Have you seen a compliment sticker for a long time?

311
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,742
The first episode full of stickers

312
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,579
Get extra points in practice assessment

313
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:01,831
The theme of today's training is

314
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,541
Mock court debate

315
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,751
You're going to court to debate soon

316
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,920
This will definitely be very helpful to everyone

317
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,088
-yes
-yes

318
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,966
Today's training will take the form of knockout rounds

319
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,884
Today's champion will win...

320
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:14,885
Look

321
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,054
Three compliment stickers

322
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,140
-Oh my God...
-This reaction is too fake

323
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,474
-Okay!
-marvelous!

324
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,851
Lawyer Yin You are here

325
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,686
Hello, Lawyer Yin

326
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,605
I'm introducing the rules of knockout rounds

327
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,064
OK Please continue

328
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,357
OK

329
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,861
Now I'll announce today's match list

330
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,362
Let's get started

331
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,824
Wu Shangzhe and Choi Haoyan, lawyers, please come forward

332
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,619
As a representative director of the plaintiff's company

333
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:43,456
The defendant knew that the company's financial situation had deteriorated seriously

334
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,709
Still rashly participate in the new stock subscription of affiliated companies

335
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,210
Causing losses to the company

336
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:52,256
The defendant subscribed to the plaintiff's company

337
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,716
and the interests of the entire group

338
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,844
Their behavior falls within the discretion of business judgment

339
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,305
Therefore, it does not constitute liability for damages

340
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,308
Even if the plaintiff's company suffered losses as a result

341
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,312
But the defendant convened the board of directors and listened to the opinions of experts

342
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,732
Reasonable decisions were made based on the situation at that time

343
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,865
The winner is…

344
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,701
-Wu Shangzhe!
-Wow!

345
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,328
Good!

346
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,704
Hey!

347
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,164
What an exciting celebration

348
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,749
Both performed well

349
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,293
But Lawyer Wu's expression is more concise and powerful

350
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,962
Body movements are more convenient

351
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,841
Next is Chi Guoxian vs. Jiang Xiaomin

352
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,177
If there are defects in administrative sanctions

353
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,137
Even if the disciplinary authority has no other legal basis

354
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,098
You can also cancel it yourself

355
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,559
The administrative act in this case is a delegated administrative penalty

356
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,104
Therefore, when canceling
The necessity of public welfare needs to be considered comprehensively

357
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,232
The vested rights and trust protection of the parties

358
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,903
And the revocation may be
Impacts of the stability of the legal order

359
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:05,079
Both of them performed more than expected

360
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,665
But lawyer Chi spoke too fast in the middle

361
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,209
Influenced expression effect

362
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,877
So the winner of this round is...

363
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,129
(Jiang Xiaomin Chi Guoxian)

364
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,547
...Kang Xiao-sin!

365
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,798
Congratulations

366
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,551
The loser please return home

367
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,889
Next is

368
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,685
The showdown between the two winners
Wu Shangzhe talks to Jiang Xiaomin

369
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,688
This time you will use the same written materials

370
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,441
This material was written by Lawyer Yin himself

371
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,193
Please debate based on this material

372
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,028
-Give you the materials
-Thanks

373
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,280
Give

374
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,247
Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Contract in this case stipulates

375
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,292
When the overdue compensation reaches double the deposit

376
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,043
Only then can the contract be terminated

377
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,381
Therefore, before the overdue compensation reaches double the deposit

378
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,592
No contract shall be terminated

379
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,894
Although the defendant claims

380
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,605
No fault in delayed performance

381
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,065
But since the fact that the performance delay has occurred

382
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,068
Only the defendant is found to be negligent

383
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,410
Skip the feedback link The final champion today is

384
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,329
Wu Shangzhe!

385
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,665
Congratulations

386
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,168
Lawyer Wu wins

387
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:37,588
Thank you for your hard work

388
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,716
-Thanks
-goodbye

389
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,552
Let's summarize

390
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,221
Did you just not understand your thoughts?

391
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,767
Champion Wu Shangzhe will get three stickers

392
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,186
-Thanks
-Congratulations

393
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,729
Everyone clean up here

394
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,939
-good
-It's been very good today

395
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,898
-Thanks
-Thanks

396
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,901
Lawyer Wu is really impressive

397
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,111
Of course I've always been very good

398
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,780
Yes

399
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,454
Did newcomers who were the first year of Lulin School practice independently accept the case?

400
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,256
-Yes
-What to do?

401
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:14,500
Anyway, the defendant has no money to hire a lawyer

402
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,336
Lu Lin probably regards this case as a training opportunity

403
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,462
Leave it to the newcomer to practice your hands

404
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,089
Yeah?

405
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,675
Then let's teach this newcomer a lesson

406
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,094
You'll be responsible for this case

407
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,178
I?

408
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,014
Do you want me to take action against the newcomers?

409
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,683
Too

410
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,184
To crush the other party

411
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,602
clear

412
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,603
(Han Sheng-san)

413
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,272
-You go out
-good

414
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,192
etc.

415
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,528
Who is the newcomer from Lulin?

416
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,029
It's Jiang Xiaomin

417
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,781
-Kang Xiao-sin?
-yes

418
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,158
Make full preparations

419
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,744
As long as you don't make mistakes, this case will win

420
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,580
No, even if there are omissions, you still have to win

421
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,707
Anyway, you have to win

422
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,708
yes

423
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,800
(Min Sula)

424
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,719
(The establishment of copyright infringement must meet the needs of...)

425
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,973
(There is no dependence on the original work...)

426
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,308
(Similarity belongs to independent...)

427
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,811
(The Celebration conveys emotions through colors)

428
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,535
As one of the core factors
The alleged infringing work must be based on the original work...

429
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,455
...but no evidence was submitted

430
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,332
But copyright infringement is usually...

431
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:40,294
The burden of proof regarding the dependence of works
The plaintiff should bear the responsibility and the defendant...

432
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:44,632
In practice, it is very difficult to provide evidence for reading

433
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,134
Proof of reading and related facts

434
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,929
First of all, the facts of contacting the plaintiff's work
Prove evidence...

435
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,149
Ouch!

436
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,786
The prerequisite for copyright protection is
The work must be original

437
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,121
plaintiff…

438
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,709
Wake up

439
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,586
Wake up Jiang Xiaomin

440
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,463
Your opponent is Li Xu

441
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,548
It's Han Shengzan's team

442
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,593
Jiang Xiaomin must not be defeated in front of him

443
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,929
Absolutely not cheer up

444
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:32,888
Promote Jiang Xiaomin

445
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,265
Really

446
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,892
But it's too troublesome to make coffee

447
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,812
(Coffee Candy)

448
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,897
But I have this

449
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,992
So delicious, I woke up all of a sudden

450
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,869
I'll take a look

451
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,548
Lawyer Yin!

452
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,429
Oh my God, you scared me. Haven't gotten off work yet?

453
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,513
No

454
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,056
Lawyer Yin

455
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,267
Please help me

456
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,189
(Yong Seok-hoon)

457
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,234
(Failed to prove the possibility of contacting the plaintiff's work)

458
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:32,990
Well written

459
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,367
Clear and smooth arguments

460
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:41,373
The question is how to effectively present it to the court...

461
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,044
You wrote such a good defense statement
Any other problems?

462
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,758
I'm not sure if I can perform well...

463
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,512
Then you can try now

464
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:57,473
What?

465
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,017
Try now I'll look

466
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,227
this…

467
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:04,439
Isn’t the trial tomorrow?

468
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,415
Yes

469
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:08,900
If you can't speak in front of me
How to go to court?

470
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,860
bring it on

471
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,741
Although it is claimed that the defendant reports through the media

472
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,161
Contact the plaintiff's work

473
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,538
But there is no evidence to support it

474
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,167
Although the report did
Thumbnail of the plaintiff's work

475
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,002
But with this low resolution image

476
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,297
Can't recognize at all
Details and special techniques of the work

477
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,468
Two works
All use rare techniques in painting

478
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,888
This core feature is based on the images in the report only

479
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,723
It cannot be reproduced

480
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,768
The defendant's work
The fact that the same technique has been used

481
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,271
It is precisely the plaintiff's suspicion of reverse plagiarism

482
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,080
Indirect evidence

483
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,901
no

484
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,446
Have you tried recording
Listen to your own voice?

485
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,908
No

486
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,160
Your voice sounds

487
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,080
It's like a crappy liar lying

488
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,501
In the last knockout round

489
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,212
Do you know why you lost to Wu Shangzhe?

490
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,591
What do you think of that material?

491
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,721
It's okay to talk to it

492
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,559
There are several logical fallacies in it

493
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,977
for example?

494
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,730
Negate the previous fallacy
The fallacy of the middle term is not comprehensive and delayed, and there is also...

495
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,566
There is also a circular argument

496
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,109
That's right

497
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,154
The previous fallacy seems to have occurred several times

498
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,280
That's right

499
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,575
Confusing the necessary and sufficient conditions

500
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,618
Although it sounds logical at first glance

501
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:42,953
But it's a fallacy

502
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,833
You've found the problem at a glance

503
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,668
But Wu Shangzhe did not

504
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,919
When Wu Shangzhe

505
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,921
I heard that the material was written by me

506
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,841
I think the content must be accurate

507
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,800
therefore

508
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,094
Only then can he defend himself confidently

509
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:02,890
Wu Shangzhe's confidence makes his fallacy proposition

510
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,809
Sounds quite reasonable and logical

511
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,728
But what about you

512
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,939
Because you have to ask
An idea that even I can't convince

513
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:15,527
So it sounds
It's like a crappy liar lying

514
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,446
No convincing

515
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,742
You're the same now

516
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,328
You have identified your client

517
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,455
Plagiarized the painting

518
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,334
Because Liu Guanmo graduated from a prestigious American school

519
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,503
A painter with a bright future and has attracted worldwide attention

520
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,796
And your client

521
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,633
Just an inconspicuous amateur painter

522
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,180
Let go of your prejudice

523
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,682
See the essence of things

524
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,648
(Court)

525
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,235
(Today's trial arrangements
Plaintiff: Liu Defendant: Wen In court)

526
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,581
(plaintiff)

527
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,462
(About "Celebration"
The first trial of compensation for copyright infringement damages)

528
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,632
All stand up

529
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,384
(defendant)

530
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,228
Please sit down

531
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,232
(Liu Guanmo Wen Zhenhui)

532
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,485
This court believes that the plaintiff's work "Celebration"

533
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,196
Between the defendant's work "Amusement Park"

534
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,907
There are substantial similar facts

535
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,575
No dispute

536
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,202
The focus of the dispute is only dependence

537
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,413
(Depending on whether the latter work is based on the previous work)

538
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,291
The plaintiff's work "Celebration" was published in October 2024

539
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,875
Exhibition in November of the same year

540
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,169
It has also been reported by many media

541
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,881
Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the defendant may report through the media

542
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,175
Or visit the exhibition and imitate the "Celebration"

543
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,386
Draw "Amusement Park"

544
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,055
If the defendant's work "Amusement Park" was created

545
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,641
"Celebration" earlier than the plaintiff

546
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,644
It was the plaintiff who imitated the defendant's work instead

547
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,230
"Amusement Park" was completed in March 2024

548
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,190
Earlier than the publication of "Celebration"

549
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,776
The defendant's claim is nothing more than subjective conjecture

550
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,446
The defendant failed to write the Amusement Park

551
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,448
Submit objective evidence

552
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,033
Not so

553
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,327
The defendant before the publication of the Celebration

554
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,454
"Amusement Park" has indeed been sold in a flea market

555
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,291
Ms. Huang Yi-jin, who claimed to have purchased the defendant's works

556
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,501
The testimony lacks credibility

557
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,004
The specific reasons have been detailed in writing

558
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:39,963
Yes

559
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:43,592
This court noticed witness Huang Yizhen
Li Ruiying, who purchased the plaintiff's work

560
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,261
There is a specific relationship and the credibility of its testimony is doubtful

561
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,014
Statement of relevant persons supporting this claim

562
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,349
This court has also reviewed in detail

563
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,687
In addition to Huang Yizhen at the flea market in April 2024

564
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,565
Beyond the testimony of buying "Amusement Park"

565
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,484
Can the defendant provide other objective evidence?

566
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,693
Can

567
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,738
Based on our previous written application
Please allow the court

568
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,740
Inquiry with the plaintiff and the defendant

569
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,116
In order to provide other evidence

570
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,832
("Celebration" Liu Guanmo
"Amusement Park" Wen Zhenhui)

571
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,376
When you were creating "Celebration"

572
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,878
Using a kind of work in previous works
New techniques that have never appeared

573
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,215
Can you explain how you started trying
This new technique?

574
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,594
When I was studying at SAIC...
You know what it is, right?

575
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,138
SAIC Full name Chicago Academy of Art

576
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,141
(witness)

577
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,684
You should know

578
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,647
This is a world-renowned art school

579
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,816
Cultivated many talented painters

580
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,820
Isn’t this common sense?

581
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,281
If you don't understand art, it's normal not to know

582
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:51,535
No wonder you defended that kind of person

583
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,373
Interrupt him and don't let him talk nonsense

584
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,626
Please ask the witness to answer only the questions raised by the defendant's agent.

585
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,503
I'll ask again

586
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,215
Can you explain how you started trying
This new technique?

587
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,467
The artist's personal experience

588
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:13,473
and emotional changes will greatly affect

589
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,852
Their works

590
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,646
Just before I created the Celebration

591
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,983
My child was born

592
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,445
When I first

593
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,573
When holding the child in his arms

594
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,617
I feel happiness and joy

595
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,455
And new emotions about humanity

596
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,040
These things have deeply influenced my work

597
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,542
My previous works emphasize the beauty of white space

598
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,004
Emphasizes harmony between black and white

599
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,755
And in my "Celebration"...

600
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,510
In the "My" "Celebration"
I used the Dichuang technique

601
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:54,181
And what I developed myself

602
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,433
Unique texture techniques

603
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,644
Shows lively charm with bright colors

604
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,354
"The party"

605
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,568
In Spanish it means "celebration"

606
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,742
That's it

607
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,203
The birth of a new life

608
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,666
Can you explain the dick-color technique and texture technique?

609
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,085
Drawing technique

610
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,465
Just put the paint directly onto the canvas
Splash painting techniques

611
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,385
Texture technique is used to express visual texture

612
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,221
Unique skills

613
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,515
-I see…
-When creating "Celebration"

614
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,101
I precisely control the proportion of water and the amount of pigment

615
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:45,023
Based on accurate prediction of the degree of contamination
Through exquisite color dripping techniques

616
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,399
Create gorgeous...

617
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,817
OK, thanks

618
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,320
This is how I draw

619
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,031
Yes

620
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,370
Anyone who sees Liu Guanmo is
The pioneer of this new technique

621
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,963
As a painter Your work...

622
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,091
No?

623
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:15,262
Can cats and dogs be painters these days?

624
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,055
Painter Liu please calm down

625
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,431
Oh my God

626
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,643
As a painter, all the works you create…

627
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,811
Come on, still "work"?

628
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,647
Plaintiff, please pay attention to your words and deeds

629
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,401
Defendant, please continue

630
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:35,824
As a painter All the works you create
All use the same technique

631
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,202
Can you explain it
How did you think of this technique?

632
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,956
OK That I...

633
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:43,999
I…

634
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,967
so…

635
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,055
I drew it like that

636
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:06,354
When you were a kid, you went to the amusement park with your dad

637
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,939
-The gorgeous parade I've seen...
-presiding judge

638
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,650
Oppose the defendant's agent
Inducing inquiry is underway

639
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,527
Defendant's agent

640
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:17,866
Inducible inquiries of your own witnesses are prohibited

641
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,244
Don’t you even know this basic common sense?

642
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:36,384
You just need to express your thoughts when painting

643
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,094
(witness)

644
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,179
I have no idea

645
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,478
What's wrong with her?

646
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,357
Zhenhui

647
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,567
The colors of your paintings are very bright

648
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:56,029
Such rich color levels are beyond the visual range

649
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,540
How did you do it?

650
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,491
I have no idea

651
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,951
Can I go home?

652
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,829
What to ask?

653
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,248
What does a person who plagiarizes his paintings know?

654
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,625
How are you?

655
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,710
Not that...

656
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,473
Please forgive me

657
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,768
Forgive...she is asking for forgiveness?

658
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,187
-you say…
-Did she admit it?

659
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,648
You discredit my reputation and recognize it now?

660
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,276
Such people should be explicitly prohibited by law

661
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,071
Pick up the brush again!

662
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,824
Sorry, please forgive me

663
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,659
Mother…

664
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,953
Zhenhui

665
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,580
Mother…

666
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,082
It doesn't matter

667
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,170
What are you doing?

668
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,215
What a mess

669
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,803
You're really good

670
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,724
It seems to be over

671
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,893
-this…
-Please keep quiet

672
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,688
Quiet

673
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,899
Given that witness inquiries cannot continue

674
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,609
Ten minutes of recess

675
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,746
What?

676
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,748
People with intellectual disabilities?

677
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,375
Yes

678
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,256
Her physiological age is 21 years old

679
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,968
But the intelligence level is only 13 years old

680
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,806
It's not that she can't take care of herself in her daily life

681
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,308
She can do anything...

682
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,604
Oh my God...

683
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,691
I…

684
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,653
Don't want her to be treated as a disabled person

685
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,947
So she was not registered

686
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,078
Can you end here?

687
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,248
If you end this case now, you will lose

688
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,710
In that case, damages...

689
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,173
I'm afraid the children won't be able to bear it

690
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,515
And I don't want to

691
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,602
Let everyone know that Zhenhui is a disabled person

692
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,563
That's why I interviewed her on behalf of her

693
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,898
And there is no mention of intellectual disability

694
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,072
I think it has nothing to do with the case

695
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,162
Oh, what a fool

696
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:55,291
Even the client has an intellectual disability
Develop this defense strategy

697
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,876
How stupid are you?

698
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,296
Let top professionals and mentally retarded children

699
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,801
Sitting together to explain painting techniques
Who do you think can speak better?

700
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,760
Enough

701
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,098
What to do now?

702
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:11,975
Please go out

703
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,519
Please

704
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,856
I am the person in charge of the public welfare agent
Why do you tell me to go out?

705
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,899
She is my salary attorney

706
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,988
Oh my God, it's really touching to take care of my colleagues like this

707
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,575
Do it well for me!

708
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,251
sorry

709
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,838
You really don't know?

710
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,673
I really don't know

711
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,927
The client interview was her mother who participated in the foreground.

712
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,763
And the person who introduced the case

713
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,391
Hearing impaired

714
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,060
So it seems that I don't know that Zhen Hye has an intellectual disability

715
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,316
Oh, this is possible, too

716
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,320
Communication between hearing-impaired people and healthy people is limited

717
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,156
She might think it was just a communication error

718
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,327
And your preparation time is too short

719
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:14,662
What to do now?

720
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,250
If I knew
She will definitely not be allowed to testify in court

721
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:21,794
Things have happened

722
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,006
After the reopening of the court

723
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,842
You said she was suffering from health problems
Unable to accept inquiries

724
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,262
good

725
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,388
What?

726
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,475
Intellectual disability?

727
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,268
Yes

728
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:39,646
This is interesting

729
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,356
Who said it was not

730
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,359
You must

731
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,446
Let the defendant go to the witness stand and ask her at high pressure

732
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,531
yes

733
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,201
presiding judge

734
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,623
The defendant was unwell and could not accept the question

735
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,917
The defendant applied for it
The parties asked

736
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,129
And it can now prove the defendant's work
The only way to create time

737
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,382
Just let the defendant accept the inquiry

738
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,426
We can use the relevance of the defendant's previous works

739
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,386
To prove this

740
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,806
To confirm these works
Whether it is created by the defendant himself

741
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,434
And whether it is a supplementary picture after the incident

742
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,979
The defendant must be asked to be questioned

743
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,520
but…

744
00:41:22,595 --> 00:41:25,650
Since the defendant has arrived in court

745
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,694
It is recommended to inquire about the parties first

746
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,738
If you find that your body is not in good condition during the inquiry

747
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,408
This court will suspend the procedure according to its authority

748
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,584
Defendant Have you learned art?

749
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,630
Testimony is being recorded Please answer loudly

750
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,009

Please answer loudly

753
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,681
In the Zhumei Art Class

754
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:58,975
presiding judge

755
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,102
Zhumei Art Class is taught by non-professionals

756
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,311
Community art training class

757
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:03,980
knew

758
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,109
Do you know Liu Chengen, who also studied there?

759
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,527

760
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,195

know!

762
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,533
According to Liu Chengen

763
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:19,287
Students in art classes often watch art exhibitions

764
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,250
I will also practice copying works on the exhibition

765
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,249
is that so?

766
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:24,751
yes

767
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,628
(Wen Zhenhui)

768
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,476
- Have you seen this painting before?
-See

769
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,935
Have you tried copying?

770
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:43,936
have

771
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,025
This is the sketchbook of the defendant obtained from the art class

772
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,652
We found it

773
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,280
Several works copied by Liu Guanmo painter

774
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,323
Submitted as evidence

775
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,827
Oppose the presiding judge

776
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,789
The defendant has copied other works

777
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,666
It cannot be used as evidence that she copied the Celebration

778
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,920
This court believes that this is related to dependence

779
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,838
Plaintiff's Attorney Please continue

780
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,677
I heard you've been there, too

781
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,805
Liu Guanmo Painter's Art Exhibition is Right?

782
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,349
-right
- Which art exhibition is it?

783
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,685
I'm not...

784
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,814
Now submit written testimony from Liu Chengen

785
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,398
According to her testimony

786
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,818
November 3, 2024, including the defendant

787
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:36,072
Many art class students
All visited the painting exhibition of Liu Guanmo painter

788
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,783
"Celebration" is one of the works exhibited at that time

789
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,409
game over

790
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:43,830
(Witness Statement)

791
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,545
Statement has been received

792
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,424
After you saw "Celebration" at the exhibition

793
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:58,845
Copy one and at the flea market
Sell ​​for 100,000 won. Is it right?

794
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,390
That…

795
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,766
That's not...

796
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,310
Plagiarism of other people's works is a crime

797
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,897
Perjury in court is also illegal

798
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,317
Do something, don't watch it

799
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,447
I'll ask you again

800
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,536
On November 3, you visited Liu Guanmo's painting exhibition

801
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,371
After seeing his work "Celebration"

802
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,958
Have you copied this painting and sold it for profit?

803
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,212
-I want to go home
-answer the questions

804
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,630
yes

805
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,132
yes!

806
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,844
I've finished asking

807
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,513
Don't stand there!

808
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,668
Defendant Agent Do you want to conduct cross-examination?

809
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,717
Let go of your prejudice

810
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,136
Look at the nature of things

811
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,139
Defendant's agent

812
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,601
Defendant Agent Are you okay?

813
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,439
presiding judge

814
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,693
Can I temporarily revisit the court?

815
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,198
In the end, you're just a rookie

816
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:49,247
How great is the fashion? How about now?

817
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,832
Do I want me to help you clean up the mess?

818
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,210
Say "Senior, please help me" I will help you

819
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,170
No, I'll solve it myself

820
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,130
You are still self-righteous

821
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,301
Nowadays, the worst results can only be avoided

822
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,012
Just admit that she copied it

823
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,057
She is my client

824
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,934
I'll handle it myself

825
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,479
Look at you, here again

826
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,982
Why are you always so arrogant?

827
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,236
What happened?

828
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:24,031
It's okay, don't worry...

829
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:33,457
What are you doing? Really convinced

830
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,396
-Zhenghui
-I messed up...

831
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,399
I

832
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,860
Fucked

833
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,911
I'm your lawyer

834
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,081
This means

835
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:19,086
I stand firmly on your side

836
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,339
and

837
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,384
No matter what you say to me

838
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,928
I won't tell anyone

839
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:36,020
Can you tell me about that painting?

840
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,652
able

841
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,601
(Present in court)

842
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,396
What does "Celebration" describe?

843
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:19,605
No?

844
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,032
Before my child was born

845
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:33,411
I used to be with Munetto, a painter who is pregnant with Rocca
Together in Spain

846
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,204
Participated in a lighting art festival

847
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,331
We discussed it at that time

848
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,167
Various emotions about the birth of life
I use these emotions as my inspiration

849
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,504
Created this painting about celebration

850
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,090
It can be said to be a landscape painting

851
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,801
-So this is a landscape painting
-yes

852
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,680
Are there any other images hidden in your work?

853
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,447
No, why ask that?

854
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,115
So you mean no?

855
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,368
No

856
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,329
I've finished asking

857
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,551
Zhenhui

858
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:35,931
What is that painting?

859
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,449
It's my dad's face

860
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,828
I understand it's your dad's face

861
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,831
Do you remember your dad’s face?

862
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,791
I have photos

863
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,168
Yeah?

864
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,711
Can you show it to me?

865
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,379
Can

866
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,185
("Celebration" Liu Guanmo "Amusement Park")

867
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,271
Photos of the defendant's father are now submitted as evidence

868
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,704
But I'll take a look

869
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:44,875
I didn't see your dad's face

870
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,129
I'm worried

871
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,092
Mom will be sad when I see my painting

872
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,261
So I hid it

873
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,679
Where to hide?

874
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,306
How can I see his face?

875
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,060
In a dark place, with light

876
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,770
You can see it

877
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,273
Can I confirm it?

878
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,155
We request that the court lights be turned off

879
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,466
(Wen Zhenhui, "Amusement Park")

880
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:41,557
-See
- It's true

881
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,975
- It's true
-That's her dad

882
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,310
- Changed
-It's her dad

883
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,480
There's really a face there

884
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,817
My dad

885
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,944
(40 minutes ago)

886
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,904
I'm drawing my dad

887
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,658
Your dad?

888
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,374
But I saw nothing

889
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,044
No, I really drew my dad

890
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,545
but…

891
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,132
This is a secret

892
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,345
When my mother turns off the light, she will see it

893
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,055
My dad's face

894
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,600
very nice

895
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,770
So I'm very happy

896
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,192
I was very happy when I drew my dad

897
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:37,112
I was also very happy when I saw the painting

898
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,369
Zhenhui loves her mother the most

899
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,287
Mom is the center of her world

900
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,461
-Zhenghye is a very special child
- Clean it up

901
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,129
Rather, she is mentally depressed

902
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,256
-It's better to say...
-Zhenghui

903
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,925
-Don't listen to him
-...Her talent

904
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,052
All are concentrated in one aspect

905
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,430
Zhenhui has four-color vision

906
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:08,102
Ordinary people can tell about one million colors

907
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,438
Four-color visuals can distinguish 100 million colors

908
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,940
Have absolute color perception

909
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,861
And with such a talent she wants to draw

910
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,196
But there is only one theme

911
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,490
Her missed father

912
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,418
Zhenhui's father was when she was 12 years old

913
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:35,045
Abandoned her and her mother

914
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,592
After dad leaves
Mom burned all his photos

915
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,475
Whenever she mentions dad

916
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,519
Moms will be angry

917
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,481
Zhenhui stopped talking about her father

918
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,903
Dad left

919
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,489
He won't live with us

920
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,034
Zhenhui cannot express her longing for her father in words

921
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,747
So she decided to draw it

922
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:14,460
But she loves her mother deeply

923
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,171
Worrying that my mother will be sad after seeing it

924
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,091
So I decided to draw quietly

925
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:26,597
For those with painting talent and four-color vision
Zhenhui said that this is not difficult to do

926
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,560
Each of her paintings looks from the surface

927
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,646
All colorful scenery

928
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,983
But just shine in a certain light in the dark

929
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,986
The image of the father hidden in it
Will appear

930
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,406
Zhenhui relies on her natural precision color

931
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,576
The strength of each stroke

932
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,244
The transition of color, light and dark

933
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,748
It's all like precision calculations

934
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,752
At the same time, she also mixed fluorescent materials into the pigment

935
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:01,048
Completely, outsiders are completely unaware

936
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,468
Only in specific light
Paintings that only appear as dad

937
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,637
These are Zhenhui's paintings

938
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,680
I just happened to have it in my car and brought it

939
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,311
The flashlight is brought

940
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,562
-Wait a moment
-but why…

941
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:20,943
Give

942
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,020
Poor child

943
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,358
Zhenhui

944
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:05,863
Um

945
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,616
Mom, I'm sorry for you

946
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,579
I really don't know...

947
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,664
I have no idea…

948
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,507
You miss your dad so much

949
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,972
It turns out that it's because of this

950
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,642
No wonder you finish drawing every time

951
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,146
Will hold it tightly

952
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,277
Zhenhui It's OK

953
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,322
You can miss your dad

954
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,450
Can draw dad

955
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,118
and…

956
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,831
You can also tell me about daddy

957
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,499
It doesn't matter

958
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,049
Zhenhui

959
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:13,221
If I ask about these paintings in court

960
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,474
Can you tell it all?

961
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,522
Zhenhui

962
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,984
You can tell everyone about your daddy painting

963
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,820
Mom promises not to get angry

964
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,739
OK?

965
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,116
-Okay?
-good

966
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,244
Can

967
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,135
Then let's take a look at "Celebration" in the same way

968
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:56,765
What if there is one too?

969
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:57,849
(Liu Guanmo" "Celebration")

970
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,726
Then he is the plagiarist

971
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,145
This one has it too

972
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,283
This is reversed

973
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,501
We apply to resubmit the plaintiff to testify

974
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,756
The face of the defendant's father

975
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,675
How did it appear in your painting?

976
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:33,301
this…

977
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,264
Didn't you just said
Is there no other image hidden in the painting?

978
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,648
Of course you don't know

979
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:51,445
Because the original creator of that painting was not you

980
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,532
The defendant did not copy the plaintiff's paintings

981
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,409
It is the plaintiff plagiarized the defendant's painting

982
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:01,496
You are the one who really violates copyright, right?

983
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,416
You don't even know that there is a secret hidden in this painting

984
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,252
I'm in a hurry to sue the defendant
Want to frame her, isn't it?

985
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,172
Plaintiff answers questions

986
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,342
Yes, yes

987
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:22,809
Apologize

988
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:27,314
Use prejudice to falsely accuse Wen Zhenhui of painter

989
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,150
Mocking and belittling her in the holy court

990
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,527
To cover up your own theft

991
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:33,695
Apologize

992
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,655
Oppose the defendant's agent...

993
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:36,698
Apologize?

994
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,533
Are you crazy?

995
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,413
If you want to apologize

996
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,917
It's God who apologizes to me

997
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,630
Such an incredible talent
Give her a half-baked man, but not me

998
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,507
God should apologize to me, and you...

999
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,344
You should thank me

1000
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,012
Your painting...

1001
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,099
Your paintings

1002
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,602
You don't know how powerful it is

1003
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,688
You are an unknown person
It's going to become famous overnight

1004
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,899
I'll do my best

1005
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,528
Tolerate pain that ordinary people cannot bear

1006
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,949
Finally got the status today
But you enjoy the fruits!

1007
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,284
Damn it...

1008
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:26,832
Imitation is the most sincere compliment

1009
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,962
Facing people who admire and long for
You don't even have the minimum respect

1010
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,422
You know nothing about art
The nameless person who is not skilled

1011
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,176
You must be serious

1012
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,471
Apologize formally and sincerely

1013
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:45,350
Of course, compensation must be made.

1014
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,023
law…

1015
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,738
It's used to deal with people like you

1016
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,499
I...hello!

1017
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,293
-plaintiff
-Hello!

1018
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,794
-Plaintiff Please be quiet!
-If not...

1019
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,255
If I hadn't had the vision

1020
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,674
If I hadn't discovered this painting

1021
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,469
Your paintings can only be sold at flea markets...

1022
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:22,888
Plaintiff, please respect yourself

1023
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,015
If I hadn't had my vision, would it be possible?

1024
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,433
plaintiff!

1025
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,059
-yes
-Please sit down

1026
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,102
-completion
-Shinho people

1027
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,979
-The unrepentant criminal
-What?

1028
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,814
-Let me go!
-plaintiff!

1029
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,858
-Why?
-What are you doing?

1030
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,610
(Present in court)

1031
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:37,986
Kang Xiao-jin

1032
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,322
Today is the most handsome time I have ever seen you

1033
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,281
real?

1034
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:43,825
Congratulations on your successful debut

1035
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,244
Very envious

1036
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,538
But where has Lawyer Hong gone?

1037
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,167
I didn't see him after the trial just now

1038
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,044
Unfortunately, he didn't see your beautiful blow

1039
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,587
-Kang Xiao-sin
-Where has he gone?

1040
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,255
Who knows? But today is really domineering

1041
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,924
- One punch to fuck...
-Kang Xiao-sin...

1042
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,133
Lawyer Jiang Xiaomin

1043
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,061
Are you calling me?

1044
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,608
Your key chain is gone

1045
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,443
Thanks

1046
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:22,864
See you in the office

1047
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,957
I will definitely do my best, senior!

1048
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,087
Wait a moment

1049
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,591
Lawyer Yin just now
He called you "Lawyer Jiang Xiaomin", right?

1050
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:46,763
-Kang Xiao-sin!
-amazing!

1051
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,890
You're a lawyer
He calls you a "lawyer"

1052
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,684
Why is my heart hot?

1053
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,103
-You were really handsome just now
-Yes

1054
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,604
What

1055
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:56,439
You treat you today

1056
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,941
-Oh my God
- That's it!

1057
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,025
-Go away
- That's it!

1058
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:18,837
(Sister: Thank you Xiaomin)

1059
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,967
Thank you Xiaomin

1060
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,138
Things are resolved, it's great

1061
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,597
(elder sister)

1062
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:32,976
Zhenhui's paintings always look full of happiness

1063
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,186
I didn't expect her to hide such deep thoughts

1064
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:36,938
Yes

1065
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,775
Do you know? Zhenhui is actually a genius painter

1066
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:43,987
have no idea

1067
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,449
If I was a genius like Zhen Hye

1068
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,909
Even if I'm disabled
Will my aunt support me too?

1069
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,623
Sorry, sister

1070
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,296
(Sorry, sister)

1071
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:07,052
Mom regrets sending you away too

1072
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,099
(Mom also regrets sending you away)

1073
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,644
Do you have a recent photo of your aunt?

1074
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,149
Why ask this?

1075
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,817
Do you miss your mom?

1076
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,989
Yes, of course I think so. After all, I was the one who gave birth to me

1077
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,534
Then why don't you go to see her?

1078
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:39,000
Probably, he hid his father's face in the painting

1079
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,251
It's the same reason

1080
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:42,670
I'm more worried than missing my aunt

1081
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,757
My mom will be sad

1082
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,552
My parents use sign language

1083
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,012
Only I can read lip

1084
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:55,308
They wanted me to meet my aunt and uncle
Looks like a strong listener

1085
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,853
Zhenhui's mother probably feels the same way

1086
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,856
Is this the pity of parents in the world?

1087
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,364
(Is this the pity of parents in the world?)

1088
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,786
(Lu Lin)

1089
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,290
-What's wrong?
-oh

1090
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,376
I heard that something big is going to be announced today

1091
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,764
Wow, it's the naming partner

1092
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,683
who?

1093
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,477
Lu Lin is also called Shen Gaojin Law Firm

1094
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,188
-right
-"Shen" is the representative of Shenming Town

1095
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,441
"Gao" is the representative of Gao Shengzhe

1096
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,693
"Gold" is also the representative of Jin Lucheng

1097
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,613
Everyone's time is precious

1098
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:51,656
I'll tell a long story

1099
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:55,034
Today we are gathering everyone to announce an important thing

1100
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:59,247
From today on, I will officially retire and become a consultant

1101
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,167
Brother, what's going on?

1102
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,377
Now I want to introduce my successor to you

1103
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:09,340
New managing partner of the law firm

1104
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,468
Lawyer Quan Nayeon

1105
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,803
Please come on stage

1106
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,180
The name itself is the signature?

1107
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,499
"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

1108
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,210
This was done by my ex-boyfriend

1109
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,711
I want to sue him

1110
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,422
If the principal does not agree to the abuse

1111
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,675
It should be a crime of injury

1112
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,260
It is to constitute the crime of injury

1113
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:37,929
We must claim that consent is invalid

1114
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,932
Can't you advocate falling into love
Is it also a weak state?

1115
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:43,518
I'll buy you another one

1116
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,562
Oh My God

1117
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,439
I didn't know you were the other party's attorney that day

1118
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,649
I'm afraid I've said something I shouldn't say

1119
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,526
Do you know Representative Zheng?

1120
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,820
Establish close relationships with the other party in the case

1121
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,780
Violating professional ethics

1122
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,157
How could you do a third-rate lawyer?

1123
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,159
The possibility of winning this case is slim

1124
01:08:03,999 --> 01:08:05,999
