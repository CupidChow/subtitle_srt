"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:40,749
Takatoshi

3
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,751
Open the door OK?

4
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,753
Do you want to be anxious to death?

5
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,421
There is a girl

6
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,632
-A butterfly cocoon was picked up...
- Takatoshi

7
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,926
...and take care of it carefully

8
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,846
Xiaomin, let's talk to mom

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,849
-One day...
-Please Xiaomin...

10
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,603
...Butterflies struggle hard and want to break out of their cocoon

11
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:08,485
The girl watched all this, her eyes full of pity

12
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:15,242
Butterfly struggled in pain for a long time

13
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,247
Finally half of the body exposed
Then he didn't move, as if he was resting

14
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,626
It seems that I don't have the strength to continue struggling

15
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:30,299
The girl really can't bear it
So I gently cut the cocoon with a knife

16
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,846
Then the butterfly broke out of the cocoon

17
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,889
Vibrating the wings

18
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,561
It's about to fly into the sky

19
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,759
However

20
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,678
It only hovered in the air for a few times
Haven't touched the ceiling yet

21
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,431
Then he fell to the ground

22
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,726
-that's all…
-Let's talk OK?

23
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,355
-...its flapping its wings and life...
- Takatoshi

24
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,148
…It's all coming to an end

25
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,651
It's psychopathic dyslexia

26
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,320
It can be regarded as a transition obstacle

27
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,489
or stress cognitive dysfunction

28
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,615
What?

29
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,326
What does this mean...

30
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,287
Long-term academic stress and brain overuse

31
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,748
The ability of the brain to process visual information

32
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,500
Temporary decline

33
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,045
My child receives talent education
Also jumped two levels

34
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,963
Everyone says she is a genius

35
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,843
This acquired dyslexia

36
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,389
Has nothing to do with intelligence

37
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,392
Usually caused by high stress and severe stress responses…

38
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:07,562
Looking at the dead butterfly in your hand

39
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,064
The girl shed tears

40
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,277
Butterflies must twist desperately and break through the cocoon

41
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,572
Only by making the body lighter

42
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,741
Wings are more powerful

43
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,494
But the girl didn't understand

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,915
Butterflies that haven't gone through this process
It will never fly

45
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:31,878
Chapter 3: Butterfly Cocoon

46
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,553
I'm really tired today

47
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,595
Did you sleep last night?

48
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,848
-Sleep
-I slept for a while

49
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,890
You can order some more meat

50
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,727
Dehao

51
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,770
Try this

52
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,605
-I already have it
-Try it

53
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,732
Taste

54
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,483
What's special?

55
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,944
(Korean Yun Express)

56
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,404
Very unique taste

57
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,282
Have you heard of Irish coffee?

58
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,533
What is that?

59
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,664
Taste very good

60
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,416
I have to leave now

61
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,917
Get it for me

62
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:11,960
-Do it well
-come on

63
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,003
come on

64
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,590
-What exactly is Irish coffee?
-Well

65
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,676
My daughter last time
Bought it for me in a very high-end place

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,345
Whiskey added to the coffee tastes super good

67
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,891
I think this is not difficult
Just try pouring some wine in instant coffee

68
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,434
I think the taste is almost the same

69
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,186
Yeah?

70
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,562
Give me a drink too

71
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,346
Oh my God

72
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,768
(Korean Yun Express)

73
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,605
How are you? Are there any injuries?

74
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,774
The Republic of China…

75
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,235
What's going on?

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,154
-What did you do?
-sorry

77
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,157
Oh my God, how are you doing in the Republic of China?

78
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,911
-What should I do?
-No…

79
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,746
-Hello?
-What did you do?

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,706
-how so?
-I…

81
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,376
-I bumped into a child
-what to do?

82
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,546
Oh my God, are you okay? Are there any injuries?

83
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,221
(first aid)

84
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,728
Oh, you've drunk

85
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,981
What?

86
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,983
What does this mean...

87
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,028
You were arrested for driving

88
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,405
I didn't drink

89
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,532
You have the right to refuse to make statements that are unfavorable to you

90
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,367
Apply for legality review of arrest…

91
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,619
-I didn't drink
-Okay, let's go back to the police station

92
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,454
-I really didn't drink!
-Let's talk about it after returning to the police station

93
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,206
-Let me test it again!
-Don't move

94
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,541
-I didn't drink
-Don't move

95
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,001
Go here quickly

96
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,009
Wait for a moment This really...

97
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,400
Doctor, is it okay for my family in the Republic of China?

98
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,363
The situation is a bit strange

99
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,240
He has no injuries

100
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,701
No bruises and no signs of collision

101
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,202
What's the meaning?

102
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,331
It seems that the car was not hit by a car in the Republic of China

103
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,750
Then why can't his legs move...

104
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,461
Although there is no external injury in collision with the express truck

105
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,296
But some of his spinal nerve circuits

106
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,340
Functional disorders occur

107
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,346
This internal injury
Usually caused by external impact

108
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,806
Although there are no traces of impact

109
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,643
His symptoms are the same as those encountered by a collision

110
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,689
I really don't understand what you're talking about

111
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,403
Hello?

112
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,489
Yes, yes

113
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,494
What?

114
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,000
doctor

115
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,837
They checked the surveillance video to show...

116
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,257
That truck

117
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,677
Didn't hit the Republic of China

118
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,261
-What?
-etc

119
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,222
If he wasn't hit, why...

120
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,351
Why can't his legs move?

121
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,938
What should I do? My poor Republic of China...

122
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,902
Doctor tell me what should we do?

123
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,905
What exactly should we do?

124
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,156
(Partner Lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon)

125
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,034
Wait, figure it out first
Has he been hit by a car?

126
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,788
He wasn't hit
But the injury is like being hit...

127
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,708
What are you talking about?

128
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,795
Lawyer Li Can you explain it?

129
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,381
OK Although the plaintiff and the express truck
No actual contact has occurred

130
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,508
But according to his doctor

131
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,467
He appeared...

132
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,011
(Doctor's opinion letter)

133
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,388
…Body damage with the same symptoms as actual collision

134
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,182
No collision occurred
But the injury is in line with the characteristics of collision?

135
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,308
Is this possible?

136
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,644
I'm not sure what the comments say

137
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,941
Let's listen to the opinions of the psychiatrist first

138
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,068
Arrange a meeting with Dr. Yan Gaoen

139
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,528
OK

140
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,613
-Who is the plaintiff's agent?
-Li Xu

141
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,242
But this is not a big case

142
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,494
It seems that the agency fee is quite high

143
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,746
This case doesn't get so much compensation

144
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,415
The plaintiff's family has money, probably not for money

145
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,542
The plaintiff's mother seemed to be a little overly excited

146
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,502
Because the child is disabled

147
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,756
She made a big fuss and insisted on letting the courier go to jail

148
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,174
The express company must also make the bankruptcy

149
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,888
Jiang Xiaomin, go see Dr. Yan Gaoen with me

150
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,765
OK

151
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,815
Well, what's wrong?

152
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,109
He's just telling the truth

153
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,445
Oops Dad

154
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,490
So what's wrong? What exactly do you want me to do?

155
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,950
Oops It's true...

156
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,452
Listen to Tae-seok

157
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,370
What's wrong?

158
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,998
I changed all your dirty diapers

159
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,958
"Dirty diapers"? What did you say?

160
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,336
Even though your mom and the nanny said they were here

161
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,046
But I still insist on changing it for you myself

162
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,423
Do you know why?

163
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,218
Because you love me?

164
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,097
Because I only need to change it for one or two years

165
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,306
Yes

166
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,102
But why do I feel that even now

167
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,770
I'm still changing your dirty diapers...

168
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,188
Not the same thing at all

169
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,440
That Yoon Seok-hoon, he...

170
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,693
OK I understand

171
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,904
Really

172
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,741
Ask Lawyer Yin to come to my office

173
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,702
Go while

174
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,039
(Gao Shengzhe)

175
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,756
I'll leave first

176
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,764
Let's sit

177
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,150
I'm looking for you because...

178
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,372
This is a civil and criminal case
We are the defendant's agent

179
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,001
The plaintiff is a five-year-old boy
Almost hit by a courier truck

180
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,963
The car had already rushed to him but fortunately it didn't hit him

181
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,215
But some of his spinal nerve circuits

182
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,009
Functional disorders occur

183
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,137
So the boy's mother is about the courier company and the driver

184
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,930
Civil and criminal proceedings were filed

185
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,683
It is said that the child's symptoms are

186
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,811
Same symptoms as when you were actually hit by a car

187
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,523
Is this medically possible?

188
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,235
It's possible

189
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,698
It seems that the child mistakenly thought he was really hit by a car

190
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,074
Misconceived?

191
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,659
Yes, this strong perception

192
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,786
Causing physical symptoms

193
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,917
This extreme psychological reaction
Transformed into physical symptoms

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,835
We call the transition barrier

195
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,715
It is likely to be accompanied by an anti-placebo effect

196
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,554
Most people know the placebo effect

197
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,599
It means that the patient takes the ineffective medication
Symptoms are improved

198
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,935
In fact, there are opposite situations

199
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,271
The anti-placebo effect refers to
Because of psychological fear or some kind of cognition

200
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,483
The phenomenon of real negative impact on the body

201
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,278
In fact, in 1950

202
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,822
There have been cases like this

203
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,075
A cargo ship carrying wine
From Lisbon to the United Kingdom

204
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,995
Unloading at a UK port

205
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,997
On the way back to Lisbon

206
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,166
A crew member

207
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,920
Trapped in the freezing compartment

208
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,130
It turned out to be frozen to death inside

209
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,510
It's not surprising that he's been trapped for so long

210
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,181
Before he died, he used metal pieces

211
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,308
Carved on the wall of the refrigeration cabin

212
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,268
(cold…)

213
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:53,022
He wrote: "The air conditioner first
Frozen my nose, fingers and toes

214
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,527
Then the freezing range becomes larger and larger."

215
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,195
Later he wrote

216
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,991
"I can't even feel the cold now."
Then he died

217
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,368
However, it is surprising

218
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,079
Because the wine in the freezer has been unloaded

219
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,248
So the crew turned off the freezing switch

220
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,916
The temperature inside the cabin is actually 18 degrees Celsius

221
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,211
This temperature can't freeze to death

222
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,170
But that crew member

223
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,173
But it showed all the symptoms of being frozen to death

224
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,342
In the end, I was really frozen to death

225
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:25,138
"I'm trapped in the freezing compartment and I'm going to be frozen to death."

226
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,224
It was this perception that killed him

227
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,602
It's so amazing

228
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,321
(Doctor Yan Psychiatric Clinic)

229
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,782
Since it is medically possible

230
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,117
So what should we do next?

231
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,078
Check the surveillance video of the accident first

232
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,955
Find witnesses to find out the situation

233
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,998
OK

234
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,501
The child suddenly appeared from somewhere.

235
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,172
I was so scared that I was stunned and could only watch

236
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,342
Fortunately, the car stopped at the last moment

237
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,428
I really breathed a sigh of relief at that time

238
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,556
But the child fell to the ground like he was injured

239
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,642
His mother was completely out of control that day

240
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,312
Cry and scream

241
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,023
Just looking at her reaction, I thought

242
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,443
The child must have been hit by a car

243
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,987
Yeah? How did she react?

244
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,574
She cried and shouted, so I walked over and said to her

245
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,452
"It seems that the child is not hit"

246
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,705
The child looks like nothing is happening and he is bleeding

247
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,834
But his legs suddenly couldn't move

248
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,419
And it looks very painful

249
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,215
So we all thought he was hit by a car

250
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,175
I see…

251
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,013
(Lu Lin)

252
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,986
Oh my God, wake up, get up

253
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,279
-Feel sorry
-loyalty!

254
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,285
(Thursday, March 27)

255
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,288
Hello

256
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,832
Hello Xiaomin!

257
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,209
Jiang Xiaomin, get up quickly, it's late for the meeting

258
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,752
What?

259
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,295
Meeting with Lawyer Yin

260
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,964
-Meeting?
- Hurry, we're late

261
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,715
-hurry up
- Meeting

262
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,134
-When is the time to open?
-What?

263
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,177
Hurry Please

264
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,556
Go quickly!

265
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,358
-sorry
-Why are you late?

266
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,401
sorry

267
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,319
Have you stayed up all night?

268
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,406
Do you have a beard?

269
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:54,412
“To pursue a balance between work and life
Salary lawyers leave large law firms

270
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,123
Even if the salary decreases

271
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,916
Still turning into legal affairs”

272
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,004
You've selected this article so well...

273
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,922
Did you sleep on the newspaper?

274
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,757
All the words are printed on your face

275
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,762
The other side

276
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,389
here?

277
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,142
Wipe it

278
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,065
Just wash your face

279
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,780
Thanks

280
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,345
But why stay up late?

281
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,096
I haven't arranged so many jobs for you

282
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,810
It was a task assigned by lawyer Hong Daoyun

283
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,940
I see his salary lawyer
I've been off work on time these two days

284
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
What is the task?

285
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,609
Just do hard work

286
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,989
He asked us to sort out corporate due diligence information for ten years

287
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,408
Why don't you tell me?

288
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,286
He said it was the case of Representative Gao, so it is very important

289
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,497
Considering what happened last time

290
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,958
We don't want to cause any more conflict

291
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,918
but

292
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,339
The merger case under Representative Gao was closed last week

293
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,590
-What?
-ah?

294
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,552
It seems to be revenge

295
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,476
Have a meeting

296
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,395
OK

297
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,188
-good
-OK

298
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,315
Really?

299
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,068
(Korean Yun Express)

300
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,612
Anti-placebo effect

301
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,906
I've only heard of it before
I didn't expect that this is really the case

302
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,950
If it's a counter-placebo effect

303
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,370
The physical symptoms of the Republic of China
It's actually caused by wrong perception

304
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,372
He mistakenly thought he was hit by a car

305
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,834
This misunderstanding triggered his physical symptoms

306
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,627
That's right

307
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,838
From the surveillance of the accident site

308
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,340
Mom thought she was hit by a car in the Republic of China

309
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,634
The brakes were loud at that time

310
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,803
And it fell in front of the car in the Republic of China

311
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,263
She ran over in horror

312
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,889
I thought the child was hit by a car and was seriously injured

313
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,141
This is definitely the case

314
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,811
If it were really hit by such a big truck
He will definitely be seriously injured

315
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,895
But

316
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,232
The Republic of China also paid attention to the mother's reaction

317
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,569
Mothers in the Republic of China thought their child was hit by a car

318
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,613
So hysterical and completely collapsed

319
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,616
When the Republic of China saw this reaction of my mother...

320
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,743
He just mistakenly thought he was really hit by a car?

321
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,870
If this is the wrong perception

322
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,914
Causing those physical symptoms in the Republic of China...

323
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,877
Then between the collision threat and the physical symptoms of the Republic of China

324
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,920
It's hard to establish a causal relationship

325
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,172
Yes

326
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,341
The human psychology is really subtle

327
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,511
We don't know what it is
This body reaction

328
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,139
It's a collision threat...

329
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,017
It's his mother's overreaction

330
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:05,770
That's right

331
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,273
-Good guy
-Good guy

332
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,233
Kang Xiao-jin

333
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,861
It's worthy of being Lawyer Yin. It's so amazing

334
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,446
Oh my God

335
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,412
Lawyer Yin, you plan
Just let Lawyer Hong go like this?

336
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,831
No? Please brother

337
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,296
Hello Lawyer Yin

338
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,256
Let's speak out when you say hello

339
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:36,801
Hello Yoon Seok-hoon!

340
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,100
Didn’t Representative Gao talk to you about it?

341
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,518
Yes

342
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,894
Then you have such virtue?

343
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,896
I'm a little busy

344
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,607
that…

345
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,609
That guy...

346
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,029
Big brother

347
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,281
Representative Gao did warn him, right?

348
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,075
It should be

349
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,411
Oops, so unlucky

350
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,079
Scare me

351
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,998
He asked his dad to report it? Really decent

352
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,584
Brother, has Representative Gao taught you a lesson?

353
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,461
That's why you swallow your anger at Lawyer Hong?

354
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,213
No

355
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,551
After the last time, everything spread in the law firm

356
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,387
It is said that lawyer Kwon Nayeon was run by Gao Tae-seok

357
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,305
Small companies are legal affairs

358
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,057
To be honest, Gao Taise

359
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,852
In addition to being the son of the founder of Lulin
No strength at all

360
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,897
But he can actually do it at once
Drive away the famous lawyer Quan Nayeon

361
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,108
It seems that Representative Gao said that fairness is the first

362
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,777
But at heart, family members are still the most important

363
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,404
This is how the world is...

364
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,423
Oh my God

365
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,467
What is the fragrance?

366
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,802
Very good smell

367
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,430
(Lawyer Hong Daoyun)

368
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,023
Hello?

369
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,610
Now?

370
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,113
OK OK

371
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,741
(Yong Seok-hoon)

372
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,955
I'm looking for you because...

373
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,126
I'm getting older

374
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,005
Planning to retire soon and become a consultant

375
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,343
I think I should find a successor first

376
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,766
Don't know where you are in the management partner
Feeling not interested

377
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,603
Was he shocked?

378
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,443
Lawyer Yoon Seok-hoon

379
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,363
Are you willing to be a managing partner of Lulin?

380
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,000
That's very kind of you

381
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,045
But I can only refuse

382
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,673
What…

383
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,632
Why?

384
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,635
Become the five major law firms

385
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,679
The first management partner in his thirties

386
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,557
No matter which political party, it will take the initiative to nominate you

387
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,684
Sorry, I'm not interested in this

388
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,567
If you have any concerns, it doesn't matter

389
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,907
I don't want to be the captain of a ship that will sink

390
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,492
"The ship that will sink"?

391
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,708
You must know
Lulin ranked first in revenue in the second half of last year

392
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,502
We surpass Li Xu

393
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,963
Just look back

394
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,133
"Return to the light"?

395
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,970
Why do you think so?

396
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,348
The three naming partners are the main players of Lulin's revenue generation

397
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,726
Your pioneering cases depends on your connections

398
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,811
These connections

399
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,148
It is the specialist and representative of major enterprises and financial institutions

400
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,858
Therefore, Lulin can maintain revenue

401
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,735
But these people are going downhill

402
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,404
Lulin is like them

403
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,449
On the contrary, the law firms such as Li Xu, Darong and Yang Jin

404
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,660
Accumulate case sources by relying on brand and professional capabilities

405
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,579
So even if the naming partner leaves the stage

406
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,664
The foundation of the law firm remains solid

407
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,585
Yes, I agree

408
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,086
"Return to the light"

409
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,632
But you don't think

410
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,092
Before the ship completely sank
Do we still have time to reorganize?

411
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,512
To do this, someone must swing his sword quickly

412
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,974
Those who do not have the ability to answer cases
A former senior official who only knows how to put on airs

413
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,937
No real talent and knowledge, rely on singing along with customers to attract business

414
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,605
Partners who specialize in low-priced cases

415
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,692
Recruiting in to maintain the relationship
As a salary thief

416
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,655
These people have to be cleaned up first before they can be reorganized

417
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,785
It seems you are looking for someone who is wielding the knife

418
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,664
But I don't want to be your executioner

419
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,503
Although I don't want to swing the knife for you, but...

420
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,971
I am a partner lawyer!

421
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,848
Are you kidding?

422
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,309
Don't you know who I am?

423
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,147
A newbie who hasn't even sat in a hot place
How dare you talk to me like this?

424
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,151
What happened?

425
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,778
Tell him every word you said to me

426
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,197
What's wrong? What happened?

427
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,199
Lawyer Hong asked me to help write a column

428
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,077
I said if the first draft is provided, I can help review it

429
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,371
this…

430
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,499
I also said
The author of the article is lawyer Hong Daoyun

431
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,835
If I write it on my behalf

432
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,504
That's deceiving readers

433
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,508
Sorry I...

434
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,719
Lu Lin is one of the five major law firms in Korea

435
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,346
The reason why the other party asked for an article must be heard

436
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,515
What do partners in one of the five major law firms have any ideas?

437
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,308
If I write it

438
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:19,768
Of course I'm honored

439
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,438
But then, I should sign my name?

440
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,482
At least I should be a co-author

441
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,775
Let's go out and talk about it

442
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,485
By the way, there is something else

443
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,448
That case has been closed
Why did you still ask Lawyer Chi and I to do due diligence?

444
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,699
Isn't this a slap?

445
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,242
"Punish people"?

446
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,787
Oh my God, you ranked first with your grades

447
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,123
I don't know what my surname is

448
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,625
Although I don't want to learn what the salary thief said

449
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,045
But this is workplace bullying

450
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,338
What did you say? Crazy?

451
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,924
The meeting was at 2:30, right?

452
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,844
Yes, 2:30

453
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,513
There may be traffic jams, let's go now

454
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:57,848
OK

455
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,834
Thanks

456
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,920
I'm not helping you

457
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,630
The meeting is about to begin

458
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,091
What about Lawyer Li?

459
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,510
We are responsible for this case

460
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:44,394
(Li Xu Law Firm)

461
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,979
Let's attend the meeting at 2:30

462
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,356
Which law firm?

463
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,191
Lulin Law Firm

464
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,317
OK

465
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,237
It seems that the client has not arrived yet

466
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,282
No meetings were scheduled at 2:30 pm
Which lawyer did you meet?

467
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,118
Lawyer Han Shengzan

468
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,369
Please wait

469
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,082
-You are talking about a two-point meeting, right?
-Two points?

470
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,876
It's related to Hanyun Express
Civil and criminal litigation case is right?

471
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,381
-Yes
-The meeting begins at two o'clock

472
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,049
All participants have arrived

473
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,344
Didn’t you say 2:30?

474
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:21,431
That's right, Li Xu informed him at 2:30

475
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,353
Mr. Jin Dehao for 14 consecutive hours

476
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,772
Drink and drive after high-intensity work

477
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,943
Drunk driving behavior and fatigue driving facts have been confirmed

478
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:37,030
Kim Deho's drunk driving and negligent behavior
This non-contact accident

479
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:40,033
Our client suffered as a result
Severe mental and physical harm

480
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,745
So we propose
200 million won damages request

481
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,456
In addition, the criminal punishment part

482
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,876
My client did not settle
Or the willingness to deal with it leniency

483
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,462
According to the "Planning Law" to Strengthen Children's Traffic Safety
This is a case of aggravated punishment

484
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,842
I didn't drive

485
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,261
You're still saying that you're not drunk

486
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,182
But you exceeded the standard on the spot
Arrested as a current criminal

487
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,391
No, I...

488
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,352
I've had some instant coffee

489
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,939
I swear I really don't know there is wine in it.

490
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,649
Can you say this too?

491
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,903
Feel sorry

492
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,071
Please forgive me

493
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:19,990
Forgive you?

494
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,161
You've made a good child disabled
Want to be forgiven?

495
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,041
If you want to be forgiven

496
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,126
Take your child away from him

497
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,419
Miss

498
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,047
Break your child's legs and bring them over!

499
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,089
Please calm down, ma'am

500
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,509
At least you have to kneel down and apologize

501
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,470
Lao Jin, can you give out 200 million?

502
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,848
Drunk driving accident insurance is not compensated

503
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,434
You have to pay out of your own pocket and bear the full amount

504
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,685
If a criminal settlement cannot be reached

505
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,729
Do you know how high the fine will be?

506
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,232
You have to do this part yourself

507
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,360
How can I have that much money?

508
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,611
So say it!

509
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,988
Excuse me

510
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,116
So you have to kneel down and apologize

511
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,410
Please forgive me, hurry up

512
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,682
sorry

513
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,309
Please forgive me

514
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,692
Please get up

515
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,785
Please return to your seat

516
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,294
I know you're scared
But we should deal with it fairly, right?

517
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,962
What are you talking about?

518
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,049
Let's summarize

519
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,801
Mr. Jin Dehao drives drunk

520
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,095
Add to the negligence, which led to this non-contact accident

521
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,514
Our client suffered as a result
Mental and physical harm…

522
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,598
Wait a moment

523
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,769
Based on what do you determine that it is this non-contact accident

524
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,688
Caused the plaintiff's physical injury?

525
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,821
In all materials submitted by the plaintiff

526
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,114
No mention at all

527
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,074
Causal relationship between accidents and injuries

528
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,784
Isn’t this common sense?

529
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:29,911
"common sense"?

530
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,706
From what time does a lawyer not follow the law
But did you handle the case based on common sense?

531
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,917
A completely healthy child before the accident
Suddenly paralyzed lower limbs after the accident

532
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,462
What is there to doubt about the causal relationship between this?

533
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,715
If there is a collision, there is no doubt

534
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,760
Although there is no actual collision, there is a collision threat

535
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,220
It is this threat that leads to the mental shock

536
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,847
In turn, it causes physical symptoms

537
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,974
The human psychology is really subtle

538
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,269
You must prove the collision threat
Causing a mental shock to the plaintiff

539
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,855
In turn, the legs are paralyzed

540
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,566
The burden of proof is on the plaintiff's side

541
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,406
It seems you are not ready yet

542
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,534
Then let's not waste time
Time is money

543
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,537
Contact us when you are ready

544
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,873
We can leave now

545
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,386
that…

546
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,639
What did the lawyer just said?

547
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,769
In the debate preparation process
Apply for a mental appraisal of the plaintiff

548
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,270
OK understand

549
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,400
You are responsible for the debate preparation process

550
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,318
good…

551
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,154
Wait for me?

552
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,406
What's wrong?

553
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,907
Don’t have confidence?

554
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,868
No, I will do my best

555
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,164
Write a first draft of the defense

556
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,542
OK

557
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,631
(Court)

558
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,300
This case is very simple

559
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,303
Defendant Mr. Jin Dehao
After more than 14 hours of continuous high-intensity work

560
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,555
In extreme fatigue

561
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,266
Even driving after drinking

562
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:18,478
Knowing that his condition is very easy to cause accidents

563
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,855
Still insist on driving

564
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,650
It is this kind of negligent behavior
A non-contact accident

565
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,154
Although the plaintiff has not been physically impacted by the defendant's vehicle

566
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,697
But threatened by collision

567
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,284
Therefore, the plaintiff suffered mental and physical damage

568
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,578
Therefore, we request 200 million won compensation

569
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,122
This court is known

570
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,957
Defendant's agent

571
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,087
(defendant)

572
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,761
The defendant claims the plaintiff's physical condition

573
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,680
Not from the collision threat caused by express trucks

574
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,725
It is because of the plaintiff's mother, Ms. Li Shangmei

575
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,060
Causes of excessive reactions at the scene

576
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,562
Wait what is this?

577
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,564
Presiding Judge This is unacceptable

578
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,274
I don't know what they are playing...

579
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,901
Please stay restrained

580
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,529
We do not accept the defendant's claims

581
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,658
The plaintiff's agent failed to provide any evidence

582
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,078
Prove the plaintiff's medical condition
It is caused by a collision threat

583
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,831
Given that the specific reason cannot be determined at present

584
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,541
Our request

585
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,586
Conduct a mental appraisal of the plaintiff

586
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,838
This is also the focus of controversy in this case

587
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,673
Known

588
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,259
Does the plaintiff’s agent agree?

589
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,803
Plaintiff’s agent?

590
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,264
(plaintiff)

591
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,184
We agree

592
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,310
No?

593
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,190
All made the kid like this
Do you still want to torture him?

594
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,778
Apply for access to the plaintiff's medical record

595
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,196
Check it out carefully

596
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,697
clear

597
00:33:58,954 --> 00:33:59,871
Do you have something to say?

598
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,498
No, just

599
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,751
I'm wondering if you have anything to say

600
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:09,422
For example, what I just had in court
What are the comments on the debate performance?

601
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,302
Just now…

602
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,055
You've done a good job

603
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,475
Thanks!

604
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,690
(Seiyan University Hospital)

605
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,483
Understood

606
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,485
I'll tell her

607
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,240
Lawyer Sorry

608
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,576
The doctor cannot arrange a meeting

609
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,120
- So that's it...
-The hospital has followed the court order

610
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,289
Submit relevant medical records

611
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,958
The doctor said we have no obligation

612
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,586
Interview with the patient's opponent's lawyer

613
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,089
I just want to ask a simple question

614
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,882
this…

615
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,011
Excuse me

616
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,490
Takatoshi!

617
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,246
-Yes
-Are you here to find me?

618
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,290
No, it's at work

619
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,751
What job do you have in the hospital?

620
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,004
The plaintiff is a five-year-old boy

621
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,923
Come to the hospital five or six times a week

622
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,342
No prescription record at all

623
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,845
Frequent medical treatment means he may have a serious illness

624
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,597
But why are there no prescription records?

625
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,059
I wanted to ask his attending doctor
But the other party refused to see me

626
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,436
Well…you are the defendant’s lawyer?

627
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,395
Yes

628
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,980
Of course I won't see you

629
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,690
Why do they have to meet the other party’s lawyer?

630
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,487
However, frequent medical treatment, no prescription records

631
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,366
It may be Meng Qiaosen syndrome or hypochondria

632
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,369
"Meng Qiaosen"? What is that?

633
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,748
Meng Qiaosen syndrome is a type of
Psychological disorder characterized by pretending to be sick

634
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,166
The patient is actually healthy

635
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,585
But pretending to be sick to attract attention from others

636
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,047
Hypochondria is a health anxiety disorder

637
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,216
The patient thinks he has a serious illness

638
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,843
Or afraid of getting serious

639
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,637
Developed to develop pathological obsession with health conditions

640
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,391
I see

641
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,397
Thank you Xueya See you home

642
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,982
I'll bring something delicious back

643
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,068
I want to eat beef

644
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,653
Don't have pork, beef

645
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,327
The results of mental identification are consistent with our predictions

646
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,914
Yes, it should support our claim

647
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,334
And the plaintiff is likely
Because of mother's overprotect

648
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,504
Suffering from Mengqiaosen syndrome or hypochondria

649
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,588
Why do you say so?

650
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,049
He goes to the hospital five or six times a week

651
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,676
No prescription record

652
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,180
This can also serve as strong evidence to support our claims

653
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,893
We can't count on
The plaintiff's attending physician provides favorable testimony

654
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,354
So it is best to find an authoritative expert in the field of pediatrics

655
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,064
Issuing a statement

656
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,734
-OK
-besides

657
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,695
I've read your first draft

658
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,906
Such good ingredients are you making this level?

659
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,660
What you want to express is the current situation of the plaintiff

660
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,079
It wasn't caused by the defendant, right?

661
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,499
Right Yes

662
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,711
In other words, the plaintiff has become like this

663
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,088
It's because of his mother

664
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,465
-No need to say that...
-No

665
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,883
That's what I have to say

666
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,469
If we don't point out another reason

667
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,137
Non-contact accidents cannot be denied

668
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,973
Causal relationship with the plaintiff's status

669
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,809
Yes, but the plaintiff's mother...

670
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:50,935
I'll modify the defense letter

671
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,525
OK

672
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:18,463
Takatoshi

673
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,888
Oh, it's Xiaomin

674
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,974
How did you come back?

675
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,770
You're so good, so many tricks

676
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,981
You said this really hurt me

677
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,150
Are you sad? Why are you sad?

678
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,819
Of course I'm sad

679
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,987
As soon as we break up, you'll block me

680
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,241
You have deleted our photos, too

681
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,743
I don't know who broke up and went to bed immediately

682
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,411
that

683
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,207
I was panicked before and made a mistake

684
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,502
If you kill someone
It would also be said to be a "temporary mistake"?

685
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,796
I was really scared when I heard you say that

686
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,676
I'm worried that my child will have genetic disabilities

687
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,012
How could I marry you with that mood?

688
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:12,141
Rationally, I think breaking up is the right choice

689
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,893
But in my heart

690
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,229
I still can't help myself

691
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,189
So I came here without realizing it...

692
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,566
Hello

693
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,735
If you want to live a joke
Don't take me with you and stay away from me

694
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:27,282
If you meet at work, please don't make any mistakes

695
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,159
Hey Jiang Xiaomin

696
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,067
Knowing kindness

697
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,279
Um?

698
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:07,989
Where is my plate?

699
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,617
When your mother came, she saw that there was a gap in the plate.

700
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,826
Just throw it away

701
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,202
My mom has been here?

702
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,371
Yes, don’t you know just by looking at the refrigerator?

703
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,624
It's stuffed with new dishes

704
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,168
Our snail girl Ms. Choi Eun-hee

705
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,836
Stuff the refrigerator full before leaving

706
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,133
Why should my mother touch my stuff?

707
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,301
What?

708
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,054
how? What happened?

709
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,139
Why did you let my mom throw my plate?

710
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,644
She threw the plate because there were notches and cracks on it…

711
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,563
That's Xiaomin's favorite plate

712
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:42,357
I know

713
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,401
But her mother...

714
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,488
Hello Xiaomin! Where are you going?

715
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,085
Takatoshi

716
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,920
What's wrong?

717
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,254
Why did you throw it away?

718
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,840
-What?
-I ask why you throw it away?

719
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,968
Is only perfect things worthwhile?

720
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,889
What are you talking about?

721
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,141
It's just a little gap, why just throw it away?

722
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,560
You mean that plate?

723
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,479
There are so many good plates

724
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,440
Why use a gap? Very unlucky

725
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,192
I'll buy you the same one.

726
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,318
No

727
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:29,862
Not a plate

728
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,782
I'm talking about sister

729
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,033
Is Xiaomin back?

730
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,829
If I have a disability, you will throw me away.

731
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,791
Just like throwing away my sister
Like throwing away my plate

732
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,042
Takatoshi...

733
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,253
What are you talking about...

734
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,046
I broke up with Han Shengzan

735
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,048
Why?

736
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,050
Because I have a disabled sister

737
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:52,885
What?

738
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,555
What a ridiculous reason for this?

739
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,723
Why?

740
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,142
You and Han Shengzan are actually all the same time

741
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,102
Jiang Xiaomin enough

742
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,646
You haven't even made such a fuss in adolescence

743
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,025
Don't go to my house without my permission in the future

744
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,986
Don't throw anything from me casually, either

745
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,838
It's really a waste of time...

746
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,092
I was slapped in Zhonglu but ran to the Han River to exhale my anger

747
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,020
(Present-in-Course)

748
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,022
The plaintiff's mental appraisal has been completed

749
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,607
(The first trial of a non-contact accident)

750
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,649
-Yes
-What is the result?

751
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,818
His emotional intelligence is low

752
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,197
Strong dependence on mother
So I suffer from separation anxiety disorder

753
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,156
(witness)

754
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,741
I think he and his mother

755
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,660
There is a psychological dependence

756
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,788
Can you explain "psychological dependence"?

757
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,039
Simply put

758
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,750
It's just that children can't make independent judgments

759
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,669
But completely follow my mother's words and deeds

760
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,046
Listen carefully!

761
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,215
It's not enough to make my son numb

762
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,635
Now you still want to say that he is a fool?

763
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,720
Plaintiff Stay quiet

764
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,680
But the presiding judge...

765
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,349
If you do this, we will be passive

766
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,106
This is when the incident happened
The reaction of the mother of the child, Ms. Li Shangmei

767
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,232
Please play the video

768
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,985
(plaintiff)

769
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:37,281
(Korean Yun Express)

770
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,493
(defendant)

771
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,830
What's going on?

772
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,248
What did you do?

773
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,376
what to do?

774
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,588
Is she crazy?

775
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,802
What do you think of Ms. Li’s psychological state at that time?

776
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,762
She seems to be in extreme shock

777
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,181
Witnesses also mentioned in their testimony

778
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,225
The plaintiff's mother screamed loudly and overreacted...

779
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,977
What is "overreaction"?

780
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,688
The child was hit by a car
Which mother can keep calm?

781
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,148
Please don't do this

782
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,108
That's exactly

783
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,112
Ms. Li saw the plaintiff lying in front of the express truck

784
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,239
I'm sure there was a collision

785
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,951
But the plaintiff has a psychological dependence with his mother

786
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,078
Will he see his mother's reaction?

787
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,747
Just believe that I was really hit by a car?

788
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,958
Yes, there is this possibility

789
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,711
That's a wrong understanding

790
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,214
Is it possible to cause
What is the plaintiff’s current medical condition?

791
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,509
I think it's possible

792
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,345
I've finished asking

793
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,765
good

794
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,643
Plaintiff's agent please cross-examination

795
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:53,816
Well

796
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,568
Just now

797
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,864
You said the plaintiff and his mother
There is a psychological dependence

798
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,910
You only have a brief psychological assessment
Can you draw such a conclusion?

799
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,786
Among the numerous psychological tests

800
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,165
There is a test that best reveals this dependency

801
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,918
The method is to ask questions based on the child's intelligence level

802
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:16,005
Let the mother give the wrong answer on purpose
Let the child answer

803
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,758
We're on paper when testing

804
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,719
Six lines of different lengths were drawn

805
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,846
Number three is the longest

806
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,182
No. 5

807
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,144
Then we asked the child which line is the longest

808
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:33,814
Before the child answers
We asked my mother to answer the wrong answer on purpose

809
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,110
Mom thinks the fifth is the longest, what do you think is Riya?

810
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:41,280
Most children of the same age as the Republic of China

811
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:42,531
No matter what expression

812
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,784
- Will say...
-Do you think it's number three?

813
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,036
...The answer I think is correct

814
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,665
- Only a very small number of children...
-Mom thinks No. 5 is the longest

815
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,667
-...will follow my mother's answer...
- No. 3

816
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,126
-...but later, private...
-I see

817
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,419
…Frankly, they lied

818
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:56,671
Is number three the longest?

819
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,381
-However…
-Do you think that one is the longest?

820
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,216
...The Republic of China is different

821
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,886
Mom thinks the fifth is the longest, what do you think?

822
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,723
No. 5

823
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,561
When the mother of the Republic of China said that the fifth one was the longest

824
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,105
The Republic of China also answered No. 5

825
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,315
And we didn't notice that he was lying

826
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:20,069
That is to say, even if the Republic of China
Ability to give the correct answer

827
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:25,199
He still thinks
Mom's wrong answer is correct

828
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,914
What job did you do before you were born in the Republic of China?

829
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,458
I used to be an accountant

830
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,877
Why did you quit such a good job?

831
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,799
Too much work to take care of parenting

832
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,635
Are my mother's family close to each other?

833
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,637
No, they are all in Canada

834
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:49,098
When was the last time you met them?

835
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,642
Oppose Presiding Judge This has nothing to do with this case

836
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,021
The core of this case is the psychological state of the plaintiff

837
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:59,066
Ms. Li has the greatest influence on the plaintiff

838
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,194
Assessing her mental state is related to this case

839
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,697
Yes, it seems to be related

840
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,866
Witnesses please answer

841
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,997
It was probably the first birthday of the Republic of China

842
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,416
Do you meet friends often?

843
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,460
No

844
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,669
When was the last time I met a friend?

845
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,963
I haven't seen you again since I was pregnant with the Republic of China

846
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,715
Your husband is a famous doctor, right?

847
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,760
-right
-He is not in Korea now, right?

848
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,844
right

849
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,388
He is studying for a PhD at Johns Hopkins University

850
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,349
In summary

851
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:36,103
You quit after the plaintiff was born

852
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,315
No contact with family and friends, husband is busy again

853
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,735
The Republic of China must be all about your life

854
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,570
What the hell are you trying to say?

855
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,739
Are you breastfeeding in the Republic of China?

856
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,699
Oppose Presiding Judge This has nothing to do with this case

857
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,785
-This is related to this case
- Listen first

858
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,704
Witnesses please answer

859
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,460
Yes

860
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,170
When did he wean him?

861
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:04,965
Please answer

862
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,054
He hasn't stopped yet

863
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,056
-What?
-What…

864
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,101
You're still breastfeeding a 51-month-old child

865
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,271
Have you sent the plaintiff to kindergarten?

866
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,565
have

867
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,442
Can you tell me the specific time period?

868
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,527
Had been on for about a week

869
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,986
Why is the time so short?

870
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,780
The Republic of China can't adapt

871
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,073
He hates being separated from me...

872
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,241
presiding judge

873
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,160
We hope to submit
Kindergarten testimony as evidence

874
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,290
It was mentioned in the testimony

875
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:41,043
The plaintiff did feel uneasy about leaving his mother at first

876
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,796
But it quickly showed good adaptability

877
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:49,385
However, he suddenly dropped out of school
No prior notice

878
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:55,349
Are you afraid that the plaintiff will become an independent individual?

879
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,103
Because that
Do you feel that you have no meaning to exist?

880
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,356
What do you know? Just talk nonsense here

881
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,737
This is the plaintiff's medical record

882
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,243
Plaintiff seeks medical treatment frequently
Is it because of some special health problems?

883
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,871
What does this have to do with this case?

884
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,959
He has symptoms and frequent medical treatment
No prescription records

885
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,132
According to pediatric experts' analysis
There are two possibilities for this situation

886
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,136
One is Meng Qiaosen syndrome and the other is hypochondriasis

887
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,471
in other words

888
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,599
Because of Ms. Li's parenting style

889
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,185
The plaintiff is already very fragile

890
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,312
He suffers from mental illness

891
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,396
You're too much!

892
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,024
What the hell are you trying to say? You don't know anything!

893
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:49,195
You don't know anything...

894
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,031
I'm just

895
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,744
Do your best to raise the Republic of China

896
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,292
I just love him and protect him

897
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,294
Yes, I believe you do your best

898
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,004
This fills the emptiness in your heart

899
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:11,175
It is precisely because of this selfish "try to do your best"
Evolved into paranoia and overprotective

900
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,260
Finally became a poison

901
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,096
Isn’t it that the Republic of China is what it is now?

902
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,727
It's not enough to make the child like this
You still blame others?

903
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,647
Do you think you are still qualified to be a mother?

904
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,856
Oppose the presiding judge

905
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,900
-The other party's agent is...
-agent

906
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,744
The plaintiff may suffer from disability in his life

907
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,412
And all of this...

908
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,750
It's because of your paranoia and overprotective

909
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,502
Has nothing to do with the defendant

910
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,666
Do you have to say that?

911
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,918
It's like trying to hurt her on purpose

912
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,214
You have to sprinkle salt on the wound

913
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,675
Did she say she ruined her favorite child?

914
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,636
Yes, she will wake up

915
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,057
She has always lived in the fantasy of being a good mother

916
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,061
But in fact, she just uses the child

917
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,438
To fill the emptiness in your heart

918
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,775
Mothers in the Republic of China love their children more than themselves

919
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,194
She tried her best to express that love

920
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,363
Her love may be a bit too much

921
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,283
But you can't deny her sincerity with her child

922
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,911
Don't easily determine all mothers
All are wholeheartedly for the children

923
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,707
They are so selfless. Love children more than themselves

924
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,916
Mom is also human

925
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,501
And people

926
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,879
Scary selfish

927
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,050
In this world, some people don't want to be mothers

928
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,427
Some people shouldn't be mothers at all

929
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,553
I know

930
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,098
I know everything

931
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,519
It doesn't matter if you beat the words
But if you type in the wrong place, it will be fatal

932
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,980
If it is really poisonous, it will become poison

933
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,608
Jiang Xiaomin Please be careful

934
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,952
Lawyers are going to use words as weapons

935
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,246
To avoid hurting the other person's heart
Just keep talking?

936
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:51,210
Suppress your opponent with heart-killing words. It's OK

937
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,170
But you can't get into other people's hearts like that

938
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,382
You're not forgiven

939
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,633
That's right

940
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,176
She's just soft-hearted

941
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,595
Otherwise, Yoon Seok-hoon would not be her opponent

942
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,846
This is a talent

943
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,349
I discovered it

944
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,769
She can be a lawyer, I've made great contributions

945
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,689
Your mom is a top lawyer

946
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,149
Dad is a famous judge

947
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,777
A true family of law

948
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,570
Why don't you want to be a lawyer?

949
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,280
Because it's not fun

950
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,158
Who chooses a career and is fun?

951
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,410
Are you in the rebellious period?

952
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:26,912
Are you playing rebellious with your mother or something?

953
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,790
Why do you say that too?

954
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,293
She was under too much pressure
Dyslexia just developed

955
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,130
Poor child

956
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,383
What a pity this is?

957
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,802
Because of this, she is always wandering

958
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,265
dad!

959
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,475
Hey

960
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,477
-Hello
-Hello

961
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,312
Where are you three going?

962
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,731
Go to our house

963
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,567
Why do you three children always like to gather together

964
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,402
In that little house?

965
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,820
Because it's very warm

966
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,988
Where are you going?

967
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,449
Go to have dinner with colleagues in the factory

968
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,533
Have you eaten it?

969
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,494
-We bought snacks
- That's OK

970
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,121
You guys go and play, get along well

971
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,831
Go quickly

972
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,790
-Go quickly
-goodbye

973
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,587
Your daughter is not like you at all

974
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,046
I think too

975
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,343
Dad, don't you go to the doctor?

976
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,971
Don't worry about me, you guys hurry up

977
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,014
Go

978
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:29,767
-Brother
-What?

979
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,727
You really signed the promise letter?

980
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,728
Signed

981
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,813
How much does it cost to do medical expenses?

982
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,774
Why are you signing for that little money?

983
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,319
The boss didn't buy work-related injury insurance for workers

984
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,906
He said if you apply for work-related injury certification

985
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,074
The fine plus recovery will be extremely high

986
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,702
He also cried and said that the factory might have to be closed.

987
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,120
What can I do?

988
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,998
You can't let everyone else lose their jobs because of me

989
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,266
Very fit

990
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,102
-I can't tell it's your mother's clothes
-Really?

991
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:15,854
I think it's a bit awkward

992
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,524
Not quite good

993
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,276
-Can you do it?
-certainly

994
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,673
Accident encountered by the factory manager

995
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,592
It is clearly because the old equipment is not replaced

996
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,011
Typical work-related accidents

997
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:51,139
He signed a letter of responsibility

998
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,266
Things are over

999
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,142
The promise letter that is forced to sign is invalid

1000
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,145
Concealing work-related injury accidents and allowing equipment failures

1001
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,649
Violation of the Industrial Safety and Health Law
If it is serious, you will be sentenced

1002
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:04,653
In addition, trying to pass the responsibility for the accident to the workers

1003
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,322
It may also constitute a crime of coercion in the Criminal Code

1004
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,283
You little girls

1005
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,035
How dare you interfere in the affairs of the lord!

1006
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,705
Report a work injury now

1007
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,623
Pay medical expenses and compensation

1008
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,292
otherwise

1009
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,501
We will file a lawsuit

1010
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:20,460
(Complaint)

1011
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,087
What? litigation?

1012
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,882
It's so ridiculous

1013
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:25,966
What can you do?

1014
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,844
You will know what will happen if you go to court

1015
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,388
If the company refuses to pay compensation
We will apply for asset freezing immediately

1016
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,557
And file a lawsuit for damages

1017
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,268
And to be convicted and
Crime of violating the Industrial Safety and Health Act

1018
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,562
Send you to jail

1019
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,855
One more thing

1020
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,858
The factory manager resigned due to an accident

1021
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,985
But he has not received any resignation payment yet

1022
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,070
That's because

1023
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,073
The factory has not had a good performance recently

1024
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,367
I saw an imported luxury car parked outside

1025
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,744
Isn't that yours?

1026
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,956
According to the Labor Standards Law
Retirement payment must be paid within 14 days

1027
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,208
If the deadline is not paid, you will face criminal penalties

1028
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,212
If you don't pay your resignation immediately
and damages…

1029
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,384
We will report arrears
Request for overdue interest payment

1030
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,136
And apply for temporary asset freezing

1031
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,514
-Good!
-that is!

1032
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,077
It was amazing back then Jiang Xiaomin

1033
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,745
This is the result of being influenced by childhood

1034
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,705
She might even have prenatal education in the court

1035
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,708
Her mother is about to give birth and she is still handling the case.

1036
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,337
That boss might be so angry that he is hospitalized

1037
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,464
He refused to pay for it until the end

1038
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,466
As a result, the account and assets were frozen

1039
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,093
He can only get the land to pay off the debt. The land is...

1040
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,636
-Kagawa
-Kagawa

1041
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,348
Every time I hear this, I get goosebumps

1042
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,557
then

1043
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,229
The market price of that land
Less than one-eighth of the compensation you deserve

1044
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,564
We tried our best to stop your father but said...

1045
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,696
"Forget it, he will be retribution sooner or later."

1046
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,160
Sometimes I think
My dad's kindness is a kind of incompetence

1047
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,246
Who knew that in the end he would get blessings

1048
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,748
Therefore, only by knowing one's gratitude can one concentrate on creating

1049
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,793
Don't worry about money

1050
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,881
Hello Senior

1051
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:32,592
Now?

1052
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,219
fine

1053
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,846
More convenient in law firm

1054
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,222
good

1055
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,267
I've eaten

1056
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,768
They want you to go back to the law firm?

1057
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,936
Yes

1058
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,980
I'll say why did you get off work early today

1059
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,899
you do not say

1060
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,484
Death of sleepiness

1061
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,986
I don't know if there are any energy drinks

1062
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,030
No more

1063
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,824
How about I have some coffee?

1064
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,204
This coffee is so delicious

1065
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,042
Can you give me a drink too?

1066
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,469
In court today

1067
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,305
I've said too much

1068
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,225
sorry

1069
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,230
Australia takes the right to raise children

1070
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:12,067
The term "custody" has been replaced by "rescue order"

1071
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:16,488
It is said to be because
"Guardianship" implies ownership

1072
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,825
Children are not their belongings

1073
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,868
So I changed the expression

1074
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,247
This reason is very meaningful

1075
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,375
I…

1076
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,670
There is a twin sister

1077
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,507
I thought you were the only girl

1078
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,301
My sister is hearing impaired

1079
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,887
My aunt and uncle also have hearing impairments

1080
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,722
So I adopted her

1081
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,142
My mother

1082
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,769
He is a perfectionist

1083
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,481
She must have disabled her sister

1084
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,900
It's my own flaw

1085
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,278
Because it's a genetic disease

1086
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:01,491
She seems to want to make up for this flaw through me

1087
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,369
Almost paranoid, giving everything good to me

1088
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,330
Even giving up your career

1089
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,545
My mom used to be a lawyer

1090
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,340
Everyone thinks she is very talented and it's a pity to give up

1091
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,510
She probably has compensation mentality, too

1092
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:26,308
So this is a big burden for me.

1093
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,352
I finally broke down in my senior year

1094
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,481
I have dyslexia and have repeated three times in my senior year

1095
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,902
You went to college in 2017 and you are 28 years old this year

1096
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,154
It doesn't seem to be a grade in terms of age

1097
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:42,866
I received talent education and skipped two levels

1098
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,664
I'm not a talented person
But it was cultivated after tomorrow

1099
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,083
It's the result of my mother's efforts

1100
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,838
Before in court

1101
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,966
I feel like you're calling my mom

1102
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,178
"Mom is also a human being.

1103
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:07,224
And people are terriblely selfish.”

1104
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,187
I don't know why I think this sentence is quite healing

1105
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,273
I can understand her after accepting this

1106
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:18,109
Can forgive her, too

1107
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:26,034
(Five years ago)

1108
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,829
-You are back
-Yes

1109
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:31,373
What's going on?

1110
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,458
It must have been scratched by the cat

1111
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,752
Don't worry, go in

1112
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,545
-All right
-Oh my God

1113
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,758
Wait What is this?

1114
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,469
Wait a moment…

1115
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:58,233
Come back, go and wash

1116
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,071
Are you pregnant?

1117
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,492
Why did you say this suddenly?

1118
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,327
Go and wash it

1119
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,706
I've seen a pregnancy test stick

1120
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,086
Where is the onion...

1121
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,046
Why didn't you see it?

1122
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,259
You're not pregnant?

1123
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,635
No

1124
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,178
Where did the onion go?

1125
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,850
-Isn't it here?
-What?

1126
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:33,393
here

1127
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,895
Oh my god, look at my brain

1128
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,692
Have you gone to the obstetrics and gynecology department?

1129
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,486
Um

1130
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,031
What did the doctor say?

1131
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,575
No concealment

1132
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,290
Didn't have been pregnant from the beginning?

1133
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,916
What happened afterwards?

1134
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,092
When you went back to your parents' home a few days ago...

1135
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:09,220
I don't want to say this anymore

1136
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,141
Didn’t we agree before we got married?

1137
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,562
Two people live happily without children

1138
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,194
I haven't cooked for a long time. I don't know how it tastes like

1139
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,242
I've gone to wash

1140
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:51,054
Mom is also a woman

1141
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,224
So you will make selfish choices

1142
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,020
Accept this

1143
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,524
Can you understand it

1144
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,859
Isn't it so resentful?

1145
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,367
Reasonably I understand...

1146
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,079
But I still feel...

1147
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,128
I'll leave first

1148
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,133
Thank you for your coffee

1149
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,468
You're welcome

1150
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,199
Hash!

1151
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,201
Be careful here!

1152
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,338
Dinner is ready

1153
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:09,174
good

1154
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,551
Dinner is ready Let's go in

1155
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,530
Our little surprise must be hungry

1156
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,073
Have a meal soon

1157
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,131
"The Lawyers Who Dream to Become a Lawyer"

1158
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:35,009
I want to tell someone that my reputation is damaged

1159
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:37,637
I don't know when every time I enter

1160
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,514
The first thing is to check her scars

1161
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,266
I don't know how many beats she got...

1162
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,017
Her eyes can't deceive anyone

1163
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,644
Do we have to judge the truth by looking at it?

1164
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,230
Lawyer Yin really took on that case?

1165
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:50,733
It seems they are old acquaintances, and the atmosphere seems to be very tense

1166
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,236
You've been pricked on our client
He also handed her a knife!

1167
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,196
It's really good!

1168
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,950
This devil really hurt In-young!

1169
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,620
Are you trying to bully the weak and curry favor with the powerful?

1170
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:05,290
I want to report him myself

1171
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,046
