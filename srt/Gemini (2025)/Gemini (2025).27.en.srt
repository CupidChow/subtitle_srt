1
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,360
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 27)

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,480
Benefactress.

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,560
Amitabha.

5
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Benefactress.

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,000
You make a wish with your blood daily.

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,359
If you continue like this,

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,640
I fear it will harm your health.

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,760
For worldly obsession,

10
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,880
do not seek help from outside.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,520
Thank you, Master.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,720
It is but an obsession with life and death.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,319
I, a mere mortal,

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
cannot see through it.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,680
Amitabha.

16
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,039
"I wish to use my next life..."

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,119
"to bring my wife, Lu Zhao,"

18
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,439
"a lifetime of joy and blessings."

19
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,080
"May she forever be well."

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,640
(Xiao Ren)

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
(Lu Zhao)

22
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:04,239
(May the one I love be blessed with long-lasting fortune.)

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,760
(May the years and time be kind, and may life not forsake you.)

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Xiao Ren.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,920
I went to Fanyin Temple today.

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,320
I saw your wish plaque.

27
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
Why are you so silly?

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,360
You used half your life...

29
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
to bring me back to life,

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,080
and then your next life...

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,760
for my eternal happiness and health.

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,320
But do you know?

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,840
Without you,

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,200
how could I ever be well?

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,560
I am afraid I will never see you again.

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
Afraid you may never wake up.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Afraid we will break our promise.

38
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
I am afraid...

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,640
you will never wake up again.

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,200
And I will never see you again.

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,280
Lu Zhao.

42
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,720
I miss you so much...

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,640
that I am hearing things.

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,440
I have not heard your voice in so long.

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Am I dreaming?

46
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,560
It is not a dream.

47
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
You are really awake!

48
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
I...

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
I thought...

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,720
I thought...

51
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,120
you would leave me alone in this world.

52
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,200
How could I?

53
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,680
How could the Ten Courts of Hell...

54
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,080
hold me, Xiao Ren?

55
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,760
As husband and wife,

56
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,520
we shall never part.

57
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
How is he?

58
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,480
Although Master is awake,

59
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,279
his foundation is damaged.

60
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,200
He needs a year of rest to recover.

61
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
During this time,

62
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,281
he must not be injured in any way.

63
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,880
Otherwise, even the immortals could not save him.

64
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Did you hear that?

65
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,879
You must recuperate well.

66
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,960
You cannot go anywhere.

67
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
I am not going anywhere.

68
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,720
I have become an old man in the blink of an eye.

69
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,840
If you do not like it,

70
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,160
I will ask Shao Yao...

71
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,839
to buy some hair dye...

72
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,880
and dye it back.

73
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
I like old men.

74
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
But this is not fair.

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,800
I want to see you become an old lady too.

76
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,640
Then I will ask Shao Yao to make me into an old lady.

77
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,800
- Really? - Yes.

78
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
You have suffered.

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,240
The mooncakes are here.

80
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Here.

81
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Spit it out.

82
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Hurry up.

83
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Spit it out.

84
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,920
How many times has Shao Yao told you...

85
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,160
not to eat cold food?

86
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,600
I only ate two.

87
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,200
I know you find the medicine bitter,

88
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,600
so I made you a plum drink.

89
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,280
I knew my wife truly cared for me.

90
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,159
Speaking of which,

91
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,480
this is our first Mid-Autumn Festival together.

92
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,760
Is there anything other than the plum drink?

93
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,600
What do you want?

94
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
What do you think?

95
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Dear.

96
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,240
You have had a few drinks tonight.

97
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,800
Are you feeling all right?

98
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,879
I am fine.

99
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,920
I did not drink much.

100
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,040
Since you are fine,

101
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,520
shall we...

102
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,920
What are you doing?

103
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,640
Shao Yao said I cannot do it now.

104
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Stay put.

105
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,679
I know what I am doing.

106
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Just wait.

107
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,960
Do not touch me there.

108
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
Keep quiet.

109
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
It will be done soon.

110
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
All right.

111
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
I will keep quiet.

112
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Hurry up.

113
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
It is finally done.

114
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,479
Shao Yao was afraid...

115
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,599
I did not learn it correctly.

116
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,759
Lately, I have been practicing diligently.

117
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,320
I finally found the acupuncture point.

118
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,080
This wind chime is for you.

119
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,000
I am not a child anymore.

120
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Have you forgotten?

121
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,760
When we were little, we went to the market.

122
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,920
Father bought wind chimes for us.

123
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,240
I lost mine on the way back.

124
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,839
Father asked you to give yours to me.

125
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
What did you do?

126
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,599
You stepped on it and broke it.

127
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
You were punished to kneel for an afternoon.

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,920
And you really hated me ever since.

129
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You went through so much.

130
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,960
I did not.

131
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Lu Zhao.

132
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,919
Based on our birthdays,

133
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,000
I am the older brother.

134
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,839
To protect me, Father forced you to take on...

135
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,360
the responsibility of an elder sister.

136
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,280
I know you are not a child anymore.

137
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,359
But I still want...

138
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,799
to make up for the regrets you had...

139
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,840
as a child.

140
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I know.

141
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
You are brave...

142
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
and strong.

143
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,080
You do not have to be like that in front of me.

144
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
From now on,

145
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,840
I will be your elder brother...

146
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,080
and your husband.
