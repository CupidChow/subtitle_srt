1
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,080
(Gemini)

2
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,560
(Episode 2)

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Your Highness.

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
My face.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Your Highness.

6
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,760
You can humiliate Lu Zhao...

7
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
all you want.

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,280
But you can't kill her.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Xue Er.

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
In a few days,

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,840
Lu Zhao will turn 18 years old.

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,240
Only after the birthday banquet...

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,680
will she have the right...

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,576
to take over all the Lu family assets...

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,360
from the head of the Lu Clan.

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,000
If you kill her...

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
before that happens,

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,120
you'll ruin my plan.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Your Highness.

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,000
I didn't want to kill her.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,720
I just drugged her.

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,880
I wanted to get rid of this child for you.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,519
I don't care how you usually spoil or pamper her.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,279
She can have the title of your wife and have the utmost honor.

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,520
I don't care about any of that.

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,640
But the one thing I can't bear...

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,320
is to see you have a child with another woman.

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
Why should she get to do that?

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,759
Why?

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
- Why? - Xue Er.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Come on.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Get up.

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,079
I don't want to have a child...

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
with another woman either.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,160
You're the only one...

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,120
who shall bear my child.

37
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
But...

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Right now,

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
I haven't gotten what I wanted yet.

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,000
I still need to use this child...

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,080
to control the Lu family.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,080
You...

43
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,040
are my one and only wife.

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
Beg me.

45
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Tonight,

46
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,360
let's have a child.

47
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,960
My dear brother-in-law.

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,720
It's my fault.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,960
Don't be angry.

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,360
It's snowing outside.

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,400
Please, Xian.

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,080
Carry me back.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Jin Lin.

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Yes.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
As usual,

56
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,680
keep watch for me here.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,200
My child.

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,880
My child.

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Your Highness.

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
Your Highness.

61
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
I just had a dream.

62
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,160
I dreamed that we lost our child.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,319
I was covered in blood,

64
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
lying in the snow.

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm so scared right now.

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Your Highness.

67
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,600
Go with me to Fanyin Temple tomorrow.

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,480
Let's pray for our child.

69
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Your Highness.

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,000
Why aren't you saying anything?

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Your Highness.

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
No.

73
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,520
You're not His Highness.

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,000
Who are you?

75
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Lu Zhao.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's me.

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,240
I had urgent business to attend to.

78
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,680
I just went to take care of it.

79
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,920
I picked up some cold energy...

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,560
and I didn't want you to get cold,

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,760
so I changed my clothes.

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,360
You didn't say anything just now.

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,280
I thought it was someone else lying next to me.

84
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,920
You scared me.

85
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Lu Zhao.

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,680
You're pregnant now.

87
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,280
It's normal that you'll overthink things.

88
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
Get some rest.

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Tomorrow,

90
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,480
I'll go to the temple with you...

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,200
to pray for our child.

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
All right?

93
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Okay.

94
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Step back!

95
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Don't come any closer.

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Don't move!

97
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
He's your master's twin brother.

98
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,280
If you don't want him to die here,

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
put down your weapons!

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,040
Let me go!

101
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Put down your weapons.

102
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,760
Step back.

103
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,776
You're the leader of the Xuntian Sect,

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Xiao Jin Yu.

105
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Xiao Jin Yu!

106
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
You people pushed me over the edge.

107
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,720
Don't blame me for not showing you mercy.

108
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
You're about to die.

109
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Why are you laughing?

110
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm laughing because you don't know the Xuntian Sect at all.

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,400
You don't know my sister either.

112
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,400
If I weren't afraid you'd blow yourself up,

113
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,240
you'd never have caught me.

114
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Idiot.

115
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
Who did you sell your weapons to?

116
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,560
I'd rather die than betray my boss.

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,320
You're so righteous.

118
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
In that case,

119
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
when I stick this into your eyeball later,

120
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,000
you must hang in there.

121
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,080
Don't! I'll tell you.

122
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,320
It's the guard of the Prince of Chu's manor, Jin Lin.

123
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,480
He's very cautious.

124
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,120
A different person comes every time.

125
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,240
I only found out by chance.

126
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,000
There's indeed something fishy about the Prince of Chu.

127
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,600
You're really cruel.

128
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
You almost killed me too.

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,039
You have the Golden Silkworm.

130
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,456
You can't feel pain, and you're immune to poison.

131
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
What are you afraid of?

132
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,800
Look. You're not dead, right?

133
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
I...

134
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,159
The Prince of Chu is at Fanyin Temple...

135
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
praying with the Princess of Chu.

136
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
I have to go there.

137
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
You...

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,896
should go back and treat your wounds when you can move.

139
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
I'm leaving.

140
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Come back soon.

141
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,160
Be careful, Lu Zhao.

142
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,000
Xue Er.

143
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
It's so cold today,

144
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
yet you came to pray for my child with me.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,160
Thank you so much.

146
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,240
What are you saying?

147
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,200
The Prince of Chu's future son is so precious.

148
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,000
Of course, I have to pray for him with you.

149
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,600
I heard that wishes come true at Fanyin Temple.

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,559
If you write down your wishes...

151
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,640
and hang them on the tree,

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,440
they will come true.

153
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Lu Zhao.

154
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,040
You can't see well. I'll write it for you.

155
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,480
What do you want to write?

156
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
I don't have much to ask for.

157
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,519
I just want my child...

158
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,560
to come to this world safely.

159
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,200
I want his life to be smooth sailing.

160
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
All right.

161
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
- Wait for me. - Okay.

162
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Lu Zhao.

163
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Here.

164
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I've finished writing it.

165
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,040
Your Highness, take a look.

166
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
What do you think?

167
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,280
(Die a horrible death)

168
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
It's good.

169
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Here.

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Lu Zhao.

171
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,759
Take the amulet...

172
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,520
and kowtow to Buddha.

173
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Remember.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,400
You have to be sincere...

175
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,880
for the Buddha to hear your prayers.

176
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Okay.

177
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Well, Lu Zhao,

178
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,480
I'll let you pray here quietly.

179
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,480
I won't disturb you.

180
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Okay.

181
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Lu Zhao.

182
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,999
I'm going to make an offering to the temple...

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,680
to bring good blessings to our child.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

185
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,720
I pray to the Buddha...

186
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,280
that my child will be born safely.

187
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,080
I pray...

188
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,280
that my child will always be safe.

189
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,679
Do you really think...

190
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,840
that praying to the Buddha...

191
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,080
will allow your child to be born safely?

192
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,160
Princess of Chu.

193
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Who are you?

194
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,160
You know I'm praying for my child,

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,800
yet you're speaking rudely in front of Buddha.

196
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,520
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

197
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,656
I'm the leader of the Xuntian Sect,

198
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Xiao Jin Yu.

199
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,960
I've committed many murders in my life,

200
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,640
so I'm not afraid of the gods or Buddha.

201
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,640
I've long heard that Master Xiao...

202
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,440
has been working for His Majesty.

203
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,520
You've never interfered with the Prince of Chu.

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,520
Now, you've barged into this temple...

205
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,040
and said these things to me.

206
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
What's your motive?

207
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,000
You're quite smart.

208
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,520
Yet, why are you blinded...

209
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,760
by the Prince of Chu?

210
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
You don't see the danger before you.

211
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Master Xiao.

212
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,519
I've been blind for years.

213
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,720
One does not have to be blinded to be ignorant.

214
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,920
What one should fear is not blindness of the eyes,

215
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,120
but blindness of the heart.

216
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
You...

217
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
What do you mean by that?

218
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,680
Your cousin, Liu Ying Xue,

219
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,559
secretly bought a poison...

220
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,200
that can blind people four years ago.

221
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,840
And your eyes...

222
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,560
also went blind four years ago.

223
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,680
Take a guess.

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,080
Was it a coincidence?

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,120
Or was it someone's doing?

226
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,440
The Xuntian Sect is ruthless.

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,040
Everyone knows it.

228
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,400
I don't know you at all.

229
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,680
I won't believe a word you say.

230
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
You don't believe me?

231
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,256
The Prince of Chu and that Liu Ying Xue...

232
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,561
are fooling around in the room in the backyard right now.

233
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
You can verify it yourself.

234
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
Master Xiao.

235
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,200
You don't have to fool me.

236
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,879
I won't doubt my loved ones...

237
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
just because of what you said.

238
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Please leave.

239
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,720
Your loved ones?

240
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,079
Your Prince of Chu never thought...

241
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,320
of keeping this child of yours.

242
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,520
And he never thought...

243
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,120
of keeping you alive.

244
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
If you don't believe me,

245
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,920
you can show this amulet...

246
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,640
to others.

247
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,440
What exactly did Liu Ying Xue...

248
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,239
write on it?

249
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
That's enough!

250
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,120
What exactly do you want?

251
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,440
I want to work with you.

252
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
I'll help you...

253
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,320
see their true colors.

254
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
You...

255
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,840
can be my spy in the Prince of Chu's manor.

256
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,800
This is the Xuntian Sect's secret medicine.

257
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,080
It can not only cure your blindness...

258
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,800
but also make you immune to poison for three days.

259
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Take it.

260
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,200
Go and see for yourself...

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,640
what lies and torment...

262
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,680
you've been living in?

263
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Once you see the truth and come around,

264
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,560
you can come find me at the Xuntian Sect anytime.

265
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Take it.

266
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,000
This orchid jade pendant is our token.

267
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
In exchange,

268
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,880
I'll help you take revenge.

269
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Your Highness.

270
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
What is it?

271
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,616
The arms trafficker who secretly manufactures weapons for us...

272
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,120
was killed on his way here.

273
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
What happened?

274
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It was the Xuntian Sect.

275
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,760
They might have their eyes on us now.

276
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,160
Your Highness, please leave this place now.

277
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,400
Xiao Jin Yu.

278
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Ms. Lu Zhao.

279
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,880
Let me help you get to bed.

280
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Bao Qin.

281
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,120
Help me take a look.

282
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,920
What is written on this amulet?

283
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
(Die a horrible death)

284
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Ms. Lu Zhao, where did you find this evil thing?

285
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
What's the matter?

286
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,200
This is clearly a prayer amulet,

287
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,360
but it's written with cursed red ink.

288
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,560
It even says,

289
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,080
"Die a horrible death."

290
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,679
This is an ominous item.

291
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Throw it away now.

292
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Wait.

293
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Give it to me.

294
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Give it to me.

295
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Bao Qin.

296
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Get someone to test this.

297
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,760
Find out what this pill does.

298
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,520
Where did you get this pill?

299
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,520
You mustn't take random medicine.

300
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
It's better to ask His Highness...

301
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:40,961
to summon the physician here.

302
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
No.

303
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,280
His Highness mustn't know about this.

304
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
Go now.

305
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
All right.

306
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,159
I'll do as you wish.

307
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Go now.
