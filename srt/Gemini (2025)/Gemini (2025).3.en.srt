1
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,160
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,560
(Episode 3)

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Take the medicine.

4
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,040
It smells bitter.

5
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
I don't want it.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're an adult.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Do it yourself.

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Situ Xian.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
It's been proven that...

10
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:18,201
you hid the armor in your private army.

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,440
I have to go there myself...

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,240
to search the warehouse and find evidence.

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
By the way,

14
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,521
I gave my orchid jade pendant to the Princess of Chu, Lu Zhao.

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,360
Take good care of her for me.

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,200
When I come back, I'll present her to His Majesty...

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,616
as a witness with the evidence.

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,799
Sis.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll go with you this time.

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,440
Something's strange about this.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,400
I'll be careful.

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,799
Rest well.

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Wait for my return.

24
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,881
I'm not even badly injured.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,559
You don't feel pain.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,400
You don't know how serious these injuries are.

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,119
I heard that...

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,800
you always say that the medicine's bitter,

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,280
and you refuse to take it, right?

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Stop being willful.

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
I'm not being willful.

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,320
I'm not a kid anymore.

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,720
You're the one who keeps...

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,240
Xiao Ren.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,440
I'll take care of this. You stay here.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,879
It's for the greater good.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
This is an order.

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
An order?

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
You're always giving me orders.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
Rest well.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
When I come back,

42
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,121
I'll help you with the ointment.

43
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,200
Let's seal the oath with a handshake.

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
I'll get going then.

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
By the way,

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
take the medicine.

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
I brewed it myself.

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,360
All right.

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Come back soon.

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Okay.

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,880
Ms. Lu Zhao. You've been sitting here all night.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Bao Qin.

53
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
What about the pill?

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,759
I had someone check the pill.

55
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
It's not poisonous.

56
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:56,241
It's even a fine medicine against poison and for clear vision.

57
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,160
This is the Xuntian Sect's secret medicine.

58
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Take it.

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
See for yourself...

60
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,760
the kind of lie and hell...

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,640
you've been living.

62
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Ms. Lu Zhao.

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Ms. Lu Zhao.

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Ms. Lu Zhao!

65
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Ms. Lu Zhao.

66
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
You can...

67
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
see now?

68
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Yes.

69
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,240
“Die a horrible death"

70
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,760
Your Highness.

71
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,320
What's bothering you so much?

72
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,600
You haven't told me.

73
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,719
Xiao Jin Yu has been giving me trouble.

74
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,760
I wonder how much information we have...

75
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,920
on the arms dealers we arrested.

76
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,360
The Xuntian Sect has been relentless.

77
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,840
What if they hurt you?

78
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,319
It doesn't matter.

79
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,680
Judging by the time,

80
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,320
Xiao Jin Yu...

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,440
should be dead by now.

82
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,920
The Xuntian Sect without its master...

83
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,320
is nothing.

84
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,040
Your Highness, you're so brave.

85
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
I thought that...

86
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,000
the Xuntian Sect is all-powerful.

87
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,320
Yet they were no match for you.

88
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,240
No matter how formidable someone is,

89
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,440
they always have a weakness.

90
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,320
Finding their weak point...

91
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,000
and hitting it with one blow...

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,280
isn't difficult.

93
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Then,

94
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,760
Your Highness,

95
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,240
who is your weakness?

96
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,680
Is it Lu Zhao...

97
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,160
or me?

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What do you think?

99
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,120
After her birthday banquet,

100
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
we'll get the Lu family's assets.

101
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,520
I'll hand Lu Zhao...

102
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
over to you.

103
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,079
Then I'll personally...

104
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,000
cut out her baby.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,280
It's a pity...

106
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,840
she's blind.

107
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,800
She can't see...

108
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,679
what her baby...

109
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,840
looks like.

110
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
She's blind...

111
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,880
because you poisoned her.

112
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,000
It's obvious that we love each other.

113
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,799
And yet, Zhao Lu relied on the Lu family's wealth...

114
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,080
to marry you.

115
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,599
We have to wait until after her 18th birthday banquet...

116
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
before we can get the assets.

117
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,120
I'm forced to hiding like a disgraced rat.

118
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,080
Whenever I think about this,

119
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,160
I want nothing more than to tear her into pieces!

120
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,520
Xue Er.

121
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
I like you like this.

122
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,400
You're cruel,

123
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,440
yet filled with desire and ambition.

124
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
You're very much like me.

125
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,080
You're nothing like Lu Zhao,

126
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,080
who's so calm...

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,240
and boring.

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Your Highness.

129
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
What's wrong?

130
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,720
Someone was here.

131
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,680
That's impossible.

132
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,039
It's impossible for an outsider...

133
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,840
to come into Zhaoyue Pavilion.

134
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,320
My heart has long been yours.

135
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,200
I vow to walk by your side for life,

136
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,920
to share a bond lasting until our hair turns white,

137
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,600
to raise children in abundance,

138
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,360
and to let our lineage flourish for generations.

139
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,520
From today onward,

140
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,280
you're my wife.

141
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,040
From now on, we'll be together.

142
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,520
We'll spend every day together.

143
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,320
We'll be inseparable.

144
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,440
I love the child very much.

145
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,160
That's because...

146
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
it is our first child.

147
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Ms. Lu Zhao.

148
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
- Ms. Lu Zhao. - Bao Qin.

149
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,239
Where did you go?

150
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,280
Your clothes are all wet.

151
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Ms. Lu Zhao.

152
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Bao Qin.

153
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,559
- Ms. Lu Zhao. - Get me some...

154
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,040
plain clothes.

155
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,920
I'll leave quietly through the back door.

156
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,239
By the way,

157
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
don't alert anyone.

158
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:57,680
- Now? - Yes.

159
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Ms. Lu Zhao.

160
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:02,320
What exactly happened?

161
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,759
Situ Xian...

162
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,839
is plotting after the Lu family's property...

163
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
and trying to harm me.

164
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,479
I'm going to the Liu manor...

165
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,600
to ask for my father's help.

166
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,119
What?

167
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,439
That's terrible.

168
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,000
Ms. Lu Zhao. I want to go with you.

169
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
No.

170
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,440
Listen to me.

171
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
King of Chu's manor is powerful.

172
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,720
The Liu manor might not be safe.

173
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Yes, that’s it!

174
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:27,479
Meet the chief official of Jingzhao.

175
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
- Hurry up. - Yes.

176
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Hurry.

177
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,080
It's her.

178
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It seems to be someone from the Xuntian Sect.

179
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,399
Don't you know?

180
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,919
The Xuntian Sect's leader, Xiao Jin Yu,

181
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
is dead.

182
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,999
Xiao Jin Yu's dead?

183
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
How is that possible?

184
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,800
She was the Emperor's favorite.

185
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,719
The leader of the Xuntian Sect,

186
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,840
Xiao Jin Yu.

187
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,919
It's her.

188
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,960
Judging by the time,

189
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,599
Xiao Jin Yu...

190
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
should be dead by now.

191
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,480
The Xuntian Sect without its master...

192
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,720
is nothing.

193
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,240
Situ Xian killed her.

194
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,160
Father.

195
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,160
Lu Zhao.

196
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Father.

197
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Aunt.

198
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,680
- Lu Zhao. - You can see!

199
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,200
What's going on?

200
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Father.

201
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:04,041
Let's talk about my recovery later.

202
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Listen to me.

203
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,320
He's gone too far!

204
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Lu Zhao.

205
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,999
Don't worry.

206
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,200
I’ll see justice done for you.

207
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,400
That's right. Lu Zhao, don't worry.

208
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,920
If Xue Er ever wrongs you,

209
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,720
your father and I will support you.

210
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Master.

211
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:27,921
The Prince of Chu is here.

212
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
Father.

213
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,839
Lu Zhao, don't be afraid.

214
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm here for you.

215
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,999
Lu Zhao.

216
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,440
Just as I thought, you can see now.

217
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,839
You couldn't even keep an eye on a blind person.

218
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,280
You almost messed up.

219
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,720
Father.
