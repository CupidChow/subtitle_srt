1
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,360
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 16)

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
My goodness.

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
No way.

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,360
You... You are so professional.

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,000
This feels so good.

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,080
Do not stop! Master, do not stop!

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Good!

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
Good!

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
You are so professional!

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Master, you are great!

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,680
Master, do not stop.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Keep going.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,720
Keep going. Why did you stop?

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,159
You pervert!

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,400
- Darn pervert! - Master...

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,440
If you had not come back, I would have thrown up.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Speak.

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,480
Who is the master here?

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
You are the master.

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,280
You are my master.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,440
Goodness, Master.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,600
I am begging you. Hit me hard.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,240
Hit me hard, Master!

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,360
Boss, what is wrong?

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,240
Get lost! Do not disturb me!

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,800
Then I will come back later.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Stop looking.

29
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,560
I did not let him lay a finger on me.

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,856
I am sorry you had to go through that.

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,000
Let us get down to business.

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,720
I have dealt with the explosives...

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
and sent out a signal.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,320
Ling Su has surrounded the teahouse above with his men.

35
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Right.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
I also found this.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,376
(Traps, Brambles Tunnel, Corridor of Giant Logs)

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,840
The blueprint of the secret passage.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
At the time, I felt...

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,720
the terrain resembled that of Zhaoyue Pavilion.

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,720
Now my suspicions are confirmed.

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,240
Then what are we waiting for?

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120
Anyone who sees me like this must die.

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Stop laughing.

45
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,840
I will kiss you if you keep laughing.

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,720
I will save the girls who are locked up.

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
I will take care of Situ Xian.

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
This is for disobeying me!

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Stop!

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
Miss, do not be afraid.

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
I am here to save you.

52
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Do you know...

53
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,521
where the other kidnapped girls are being held?

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,320
Yes. I will take you there.

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Let us go.

56
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,560
This is what you get for not listening to me!

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
They are here.

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Stop!

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Hurry, get up.

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,200
You must leave at once.

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Get out of here!

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Go!

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Go!

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,320
I will not do it again.

65
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,040
Miss! Miss, it is all right.

66
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,640
Miss, you are all right now.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
It is all over now, miss.

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Miss.

69
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Liu Ying Xue?

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,720
Why are you here?

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,120
Why has His Highness not visited me these days?

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,760
Miss, His Highness is busy with work.

73
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
He does not have time.

74
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,040
How could he be busy all the time?

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He must have another woman in the manor.

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,960
I will look for him myself.

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,696
- I will look for him myself. - Miss.

78
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,136
His Highness told you to rest and care for your pregnancy.

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,600
- You must not go out. - Get lost!

80
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Your Highness.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Your Highness!

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Your Highness!

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Your Highness.

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Your Highness.

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Your Highness!

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Your Highness.

87
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
Your Highness.

88
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Your Highness.

89
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
I do not know.

90
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
I do not know!

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,560
Get lost! Do not touch me!

92
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,960
I am waiting for His Highness to save me.

93
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,399
His Highness will save me later.

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,480
Look at the situation.

95
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,480
You are still hoping that man will save you?

96
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Come with me.

97
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
I am not going with you.

98
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,200
I have harmed you so many times.

99
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,840
I do not believe you will be kind enough to save me!

100
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,360
Wake up!

101
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Move.

102
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Useless!

103
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
You are so useless!

104
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,240
Is this how you watch over your mistress?

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,680
Where did she go?

106
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,040
Ms. Liu insisted on looking for you herself.

107
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,776
By the time I rushed outside,

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
she was already gone.

109
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,880
I really do not know anything.

110
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Xiao Ren.

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,800
I cannot believe you actually found Jifang Pavilion.

112
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Situ Xian.

113
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,800
It really is you.

114
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,119
I am a dignified prince.

115
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
How dare you arrest me without an imperial decree?

116
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,520
What a prince.

117
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,479
You colluded with the Qiang people...

118
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,520
with the intent to rebel.

119
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,000
The evidence is conclusive.

120
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,680
So what if I execute first and report later?

121
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Chief.

122
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,160
I have everyone in Jifang Pavilion under control.

123
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,560
Ms. Lu rescued all the courtesans who were imprisoned.

124
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,160
Liu Ying Xue was among them.

125
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
What did you say?

126
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
Why would Xue Er be there?

127
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,000
She went there to look for you.

128
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,400
Lu Zhao, that wench.

129
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,776
Why would she help Xue Er out of the goodness of her heart?

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,040
You must be lying to me.

131
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,880
Those with corrupted hearts...

132
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,840
really cannot stand anything pure.

133
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Take him away.

134
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,800
Xiao Ren! Xiao Ren!

135
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,280
(Jifang Pavilion)

136
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,480
What happened here?

137
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
You do not know, do you?

138
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,360
They just uncovered a secret brothel here.

139
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,416
I heard all the clients were high-ranking officials and nobles.

140
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,536
As long as you have money, you can do whatever you want.

141
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,880
They all look like decent people,

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
but in actual fact...

143
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
You just wait.

144
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,280
Those courtesans will be brought out soon.

145
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,520
I want to see what kind of harlots they are.

146
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,160
We are too poor to have fun, but can we not at least look?

147
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Exactly.

148
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,640
These girls are pitiful enough.

149
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,200
Do you not have any sympathy?

150
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,680
Why speak so foully of them?

151
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Who are you?

152
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,520
We were not talking about you.

153
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,920
How do you know they are not willing?

154
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
There are so many women in this world.

155
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,360
Why kidnap only them and not others?

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
If they were virtuous,

157
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,360
they would have remained at home.

158
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,640
Who could kidnap them?

159
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,040
If you ask me, they are the shameless ones.

160
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,240
It takes two hands to clap.

161
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
You!

162
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,280
Can you clap with one hand?

163
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
No?

164
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Then take another one!

165
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,000
- You! - Forget it, forget it.

166
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
This girl is really...

167
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Clear the area!

168
00:09:45,281 --> 00:09:47,616
Xuntian Sect is on official duty. No one is allowed to enter.

169
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,120
You, send two carriages.

170
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,136
Do not let anyone see the young ladies' faces.

171
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Yes!

172
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,400
- Time to go. - Let us go home.

173
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
On behalf of all sisters,

174
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,440
I kneel in gratitude to the Xuntian Sect.

175
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Our savior,

176
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,360
thank you for your kindness.

177
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
Thank you, savior.

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do not kneel.

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
All of you, get up now.

180
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
From today onwards,

181
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
you no longer have to kneel to anyone.

182
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
My savior,

183
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,120
I lost my family long ago.

184
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,360
I cannot go on living either.

185
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,376
To be able to leave this place...

186
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
before I die,

187
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
I am content.

188
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Please, my savior,

189
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
let me bow to you.

190
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,600
Xue Lian, hurry.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,120
Get up at once.

192
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Do not be silly again.

193
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,400
No matter what happened in the past,

194
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,600
staying alive is the most important.

195
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Stay alive?

196
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,880
We have already been ruined to such an extent.

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,080
How can we go on living?

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I am just like you.

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,840
I also came out of the brothel.

200
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,640
We were never dirty.

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,040
It was also not our fault.

202
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,440
We are innocent.

203
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,640
No one has the right to criticize us.

204
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,680
I am able to walk out of this...

205
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,080
and live with dignity.

206
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,240
Why can you not?

207
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,000
I have an embroidery shop outside the city.

208
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,880
Food and lodging are included.

209
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
I will pay you too.

210
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Those without a home,

211
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,936
and those who cannot return to theirs,

212
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
are welcomed there.

213
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,160
Over there, you can make a living on your own...

214
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,680
and live in dignity and honor.

215
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Shao Yao.

216
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Take them there.

217
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Let us go.

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Bring him out.

219
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,920
Just you wait and see.

220
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,400
Lu Zhao!

221
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,080
Lu Zhao! Lu Zhao!

222
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Move!

223
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,840
You poisoned her.

224
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,400
Where is the antidote?

225
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,679
My Xuntian Sect can cut a man...

226
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,160
a thousand times without killing him.

227
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
How many cuts do you think you can endure?

228
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Where is the antidote?

229
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,240
For Lu Zhao,

230
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,440
you would lose control to such an extent.

231
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
This way,

232
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,800
things will be easier.

233
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,079
It is painful to lose...

234
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,800
your family and loved ones, is it not?

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,400
You always thought I was the one who killed Xiao Jin Yu.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,440
That is why you have been hounding me...

237
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,520
like a mad dog.

238
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,320
You even extended your reach...

239
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,040
into my inner residence.

240
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
But do you know...

241
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,080
how Xiao Jin Yu died?

242
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,560
Speaking of which,

243
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,520
I have never seen...

244
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,360
a woman as hard to kill as Xiao Jin Yu.

245
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,600
Xiao Jin Yu intercepted and killed the craftsmen who made the weapons.

246
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,120
It was only a matter of time before she traced it back to me.

247
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,680
So I set a trap...

248
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,640
to lure her into an ambush.

249
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,360
I wanted to get rid of both of you that day.

250
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,920
But you did not go.

251
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,280
Only Xiao Jin Yu went to her death.

252
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Release the arrows!

253
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,400
Dozens of suicide warriors surrounded her.

254
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,120
She was badly injured.

255
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,960
But she still managed to escape.

256
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,280
Even I could not help but admire her.

257
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
It is a pity...

258
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,920
that she still died.

259
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,200
Back then, you could not protect Xiao Jin Yu.

260
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
And now,

261
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
you cannot protect Lu Zhao either.

262
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,720
From beginning to end,

263
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,840
you have always been my defeated foe!
