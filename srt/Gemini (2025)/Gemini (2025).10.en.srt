1
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,280
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 10)

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,759
Last night,
at the foot of the cliff,

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,040
I didn't sleep or rest,

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,320
just to pave a path...

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,800
to your death for you, Father.

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
That way, you can die soon...

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,040
That way,

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,439
you can reunite...

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,640
with my aunt.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,320
You wretched woman!

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,000
You don't believe me?

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Listen.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,920
Death...

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,920
is knocking at your door.

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,680
This is Her Highness's
private chamber.

17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,680
Master Xiao,
please show some respect.

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
You aren't kneeling
in front of an imperial edict.

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,560
Is Your Highness
defying His Majesty?

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Liu Ming Fu.

21
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,920
As a court official,

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,319
you colluded with bandits...

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,640
in an attempt
to murder the Princess.

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
The evidence is irrefutable.

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
This is an intolerable act.

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
By imperial decree,
the Xuntian Sect...

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,320
is to arrest
the criminal, Liu Ming Fu.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
This is an imperial decree.

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
What are you doing?

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
What are you doing?

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,560
These bandits
have always been rampant.

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,480
What does this have to do
with Lord Liu?

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Xiao Ren.

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
You're doing this on purpose!

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Speak.

36
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,680
Let Lord Liu die knowing why.

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Your Highness, I had no choice.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That day,

39
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,760
Master's attendant suddenly
brought a bottle of powder.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,280
He told me to mix it
into the pear cake.

41
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,520
But it's food.
I wouldn't dare tamper with it.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,120
But the person was watching me then.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,120
I had no choice but to mix it in.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,639
But I was so scared.

45
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,480
I accidentally
left some between my fingers.

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
I've already sent someone...

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
to verify it
with the Imperial Physician.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,240
The medicine can make a person
drowsy and weak.

49
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
No wonder.

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,120
After I ate the pear cake,

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,279
I started to feel sleepy.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,640
Someone found us two days ago.

53
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,880
He said there was a deal
at Fox Tail Cliff.

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
There was a woman
in mourning on the carriage.

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,120
They said she had been drugged,

56
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
so she wouldn't resist.

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,800
He asked us to pretend
to push her off the cliff.

58
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,640
He said there would be no trouble.

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,600
How can that prove that I did it?

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,040
Where did this sachet come from?

61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,560
That day, I saw
that person was well-dressed.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
I knew a powerful man was involved.

63
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,160
I secretly took his sachet.

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,040
I thought that if I got exposed,

65
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,920
I would have a way out.

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,440
Xi Zhong is an unusual name.

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
If I remember correctly,

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,640
this is Lord Liu's courtesy name.

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,719
They're bandits.

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,440
They stole my sachet to frame me.

71
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Father!

72
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Father!

73
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Lord Xiao.

74
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,640
There must be some misunderstanding.

75
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
Lord Liu is my father.

76
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,160
Why would he harm his own daughter?

77
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Lord Xiao.

78
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,400
You must investigate this matter...

79
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,560
and clear my father's name.

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Your Highness,

81
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,160
you see him as your father,

82
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,360
but he might not see you
as his daughter.

83
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
But don't worry, Your Highness.

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I will definitely interrogate
Liu Ming Fu...

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,959
about his intentions.

86
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,000
I will find out
if anyone instigated him.

87
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,840
I'll find out everything...

88
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,680
and report it to His Majesty.

89
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
It was you.

90
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
It was you.

91
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Take him away.

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Father!

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,240
Let go of my father!

94
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Father!

95
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Father!

96
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,160
- Father!
- Let go of me!

97
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
The pastries at your manor
are indeed delicious.

98
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Pastries from other places...

99
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
just aren't as good.

100
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Sorry to bother you.

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Your Highness.

102
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Sorry for the trouble.

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,640
- Your Highness.
- Lu Zhao.

104
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,960
I don't believe Father
would do such a thing.

105
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,080
Your Highness must save Father.

106
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,840
You must save Father!

107
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,080
My dear.

108
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Don't worry.

109
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,480
I will find out the truth...

110
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,640
and clear...

111
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
my father-in-law's name.

112
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Lu Zhao.

113
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,880
What are you playing at?

114
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Father.

115
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,560
How are you doing here?

116
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,440
You truly are my good daughter.

117
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,000
Didn't you want to know...

118
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,080
who has been helping me?

119
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,760
(Prisoner)

120
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,040
I guess I was right.

121
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
You devil!

122
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,000
You'll be punished!

123
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,280
Since I'm a devil,

124
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,720
what's there to be afraid of?

125
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,280
I indeed pretended to have amnesia.

126
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
I know...

127
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,240
that my mother's death back then...

128
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,880
wasn't suicide.

129
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,040
It was you and Fang Yuan Rou...

130
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,560
who forced her to die.

131
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,320
When I killed Fang Yuan Rou,

132
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
I knew...

133
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
you would seek revenge.

134
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
I killed her...

135
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,000
so that you would make a move.

136
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,080
According to the Southern Qing Law,

137
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,280
colluding with bandits
only gets me exiled at most.

138
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,160
You did all this just for that?

139
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
What are you so proud of?

140
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,480
You know
so many of Situ Xian's secrets.

141
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
Why don't you make a guess?

142
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,560
Now that you're in the hands
of the Xuntian Sect,

143
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,400
will he let you live in peace?

144
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,280
His Highness likes Xue Er.

145
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,960
He'll surely come and save me.

146
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,600
Then do you want the world
to know her background?

147
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,080
With such a filthy background,

148
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,639
her dream of becoming
the Princess of Chu...

149
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,400
will never come true.

150
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,400
If death doesn't want you,

151
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600
I'll be your nightmare.

152
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,880
Wench!

153
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
You wench!

154
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,200
You're just as heartless
as your mother!

155
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,879
Your mother forced me to marry
into the Lu family, ruining my life.

156
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,440
You seduced a man
and tried to kill me!

157
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,759
All of you from the Lu family
are evil!

158
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
It's all your Lu family's fault!

159
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
He's dead?

160
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Yes.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
He knew what was good for him.

162
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Your Highness.

163
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,439
After Ms. Liu found out...

164
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
that Lord Liu
committed suicide in prison,

165
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,720
she became agitated and fainted.

166
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,760
Just have someone
take her home to rest.

167
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
But...

168
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
What is it?

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,080
I took Ms. Liu's pulse just now.

170
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
She's pregnant.

171
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Go and calm her down first.

172
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
I'll be right there.

173
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Yes.

174
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Don't come near me!

175
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Get lost!

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,040
I want to see His Highness!

177
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Ms. Liu.

178
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,920
You're pregnant. Don't be rash.

179
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I told you!

180
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,320
I want to see His Highness!

181
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Xue Er.

182
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Xue Er.

183
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Put down the knife.

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Let's talk it out.

185
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
All right?

186
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,920
Your Highness!

187
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,280
Even now,

188
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,000
are you still unwilling
to believe me?

189
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,560
My father...

190
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
and my mother...

191
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,039
They were all killed
by Lu Zhao, one by one.

192
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm next.

193
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,360
Of course, I believe you.

194
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,600
The Lu Clan Chief is arriving
in the capital soon.

195
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,520
Bear with it for a few more days.

196
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
I can't wait any longer.

197
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,400
I can't wait any longer.

198
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,000
I've tolerated her for too long.

199
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,319
I want her to die!

200
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,760
I want her to die now!

201
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,760
I want her to pay
for my parents' lives!

202
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,160
I want her to pay!

203
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,840
- Xue Er!
- I want her to pay!

204
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Don't you know this?

205
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,680
I've been holding back
for so many years.

206
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,200
Was it just for myself?

207
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,000
Think about our child.

208
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Don't you...

209
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
want him to be the Crown Prince?

210
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Our child?

211
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
We're going to have a child.

212
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
We're going to have a child.

213
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
The Crown Prince?

214
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Xue Er.

215
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,920
Your Highness!

216
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,480
Your Highness!

217
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,440
The day that the Lu Clan Chief...

218
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,880
returns to the capital...

219
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,600
will also be the day
of Lu Zhao's death.

220
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,160
Master Xiao, you came so quickly.

221
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
You summoned me.

222
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I wouldn't dare to dawdle.

223
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,880
Let's get down to business.

224
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,520
The Lu Clan Chief...

225
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
will arrive in the capital soon.

226
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Then,

227
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm going to give
all the Lu Clan's assets...

228
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,520
to Situ Xian.

229
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
What?

230
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,560
Now that it has come to this,

231
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
are you reluctant?

232
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,040
If I want him to die,

233
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,840
I have to make him go crazy first.

234
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,960
After he gets the assets,

235
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,600
he'll surely make a move.

236
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,840
Then, we can catch him...

237
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
red-handed.

238
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,400
But his first move
after he gets the assets...

239
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
will be to kill you.

240
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Therefore,

241
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,000
I need a legitimate reason...

242
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,520
to leave the manor.

243
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I heard Liu Ming Fu
committed suicide in prison.

244
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,280
And the one who drove him
to his death...

245
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,480
was his eldest daughter.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Since that's the case,

247
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,800
I've committed a grave sin
of being unfilial.

248
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,159
Currently, the ninth uncle
heads the imperial family.

249
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,040
He's in charge of the family's
etiquette and education.

250
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,959
If anyone is suspected
of immorality,

251
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
he has to admonish them.

252
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,840
You've committed
a grave sin of being unfilial.

253
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,480
You'll surely be sent
to Pilan Palace...

254
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,000
to get a lecture from him.

255
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,520
I reckon Situ Xian...

256
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,400
wouldn't dare to make a move
at Pilan Palace.

257
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,840
Otherwise, his ninth uncle
would investigate things thoroughly.

258
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Besides that,

259
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,600
I have another important task to do.

260
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm going to divorce him.

261
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
(Yanyu Chamber)

262
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Have you heard?

263
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,039
The Princess forced her own father
to commit suicide in prison.

264
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,719
Everyone is talking about it now.

265
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,840
That's a grave sin.

266
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,000
Even His Highness
couldn't protect her.

267
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,239
I heard she'll be sent
to Pilan Palace for training soon.

268
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Pilan Palace?

269
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,120
How is that different from prison?

270
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,280
It is headed by Situ Xing Yuan,
the imperial family's ninth uncle.

271
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
That's right.

272
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,360
Her Highness is in for a hard time.

273
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Lu Zhao.

274
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,560
There are many rumors
in the capital now.

275
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,560
The Empress ordered you
to be trained at Pilan Palace.

276
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,080
Don't worry.

277
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,080
I'll go to the palace
and plead for you.

278
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,360
After this matter has settled down,

279
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,840
I will personally...

280
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
bring you home.

281
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,160
But Pilan Palace...

282
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,200
belongs to Ninth Uncle.

283
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
He is strict.

284
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,440
He won't allow servants
to accompany you.

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,600
I've arranged a guard for you.

286
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,840
He can protect you.

287
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

288
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Keep an eye on her.

289
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Report back to me...

290
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
if anything is out of the ordinary.

291
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Don't worry, Your Highness.
