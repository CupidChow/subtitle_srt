1
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,360
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 25)

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,759
- You animal! - The news of Song Lou's treason...

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,800
spread quickly...

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,400
and stirred the people's rage.

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
Pressed by the situation,

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,839
I had no choice but to decree that the entire Song family...

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,280
be confined to their residence...

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
and beheaded in seven days.

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,639
(I am not afraid of death.)

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,616
(I only ask, Your Majesty, to find a way to protect my family.)

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,560
(Madam Song)

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,240
Madam Song, there has been a change of plans.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,399
The Qiang's spies...

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,600
have infiltrated Ying,

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,800
spreading word everywhere...

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
that the Qiang King has issued a bounty.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
For each corpse...

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
of the Song family,

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,520
the reward is one hundred taels.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,119
His Majesty originally planned a secret beheading...

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,520
and to bury the bodies immediately.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
But now,

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,759
many commoners gather to watch every day.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
Fearing unrest,

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
we have to take the risk...

27
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:29,400
of transferring you earlier.

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Madam Song.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Minister Xiao...

30
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,761
has found replacements for all of you...

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,840
among the death row prisoners at the Xuntian Sect.

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,160
After you are transferred,

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,240
burn this house down.

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,640
Send word that the Song family committed suicide out of guilt...

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,360
and perished in the fire.

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
No.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Your Majesty.

38
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,080
That Qiang scoundrel insists on seeing the Song family's corpses.

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,000
It is clear that he does not fully trust my husband yet.

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,999
My husband is all alone now...

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
in the enemy camp.

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,560
His life hangs by a thread.

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,119
The Qiang King's slightest suspicion...

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,440
would be enough to end his life.

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,280
At this critical moment,

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,480
only the lives of our entire Song family...

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,520
can help him get through it safely.

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,240
Madam Song, please reconsider.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,720
Minister Song has sacrificed himself,

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,840
suffering false accusations for the country.

51
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,080
If I cannot even protect his family,

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,080
how shall I face Minister Song's loyal spirit?

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,120
Your Majesty, Yongzhou suffered a crushing defeat.

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,960
General Xiao died valiantly to send him into Qiang.

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,320
Countless soldiers and martyrs had been sacrificed for this.

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
At this life-and-death moment,

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,200
if my Song family clings to life disgracefully,

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,359
how could we face the spirits of the martyrs...

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,440
who died on the front line?

60
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,080
He returned to me this jade pendant, the token of our love.

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,000
That shows his resolve to face death.

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Your Majesty.

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,759
For the sake of the realm...

64
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,160
and my husband's safety,

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,039
I beg Your Majesty...

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,000
to order the execution of my entire Song family,

67
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
so as to free Song Lou...

68
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,280
from all worries.

69
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
I have only one request.

70
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Please, Your Majesty,

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
for the sake of the Song family,

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
preserve our sole remaining bloodline.

73
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,280
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty.

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,360
I am willing to die...

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,160
for the greater cause.

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,920
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty.

77
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,839
I am willing to die...

78
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,600
for the greater cause.

79
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,920
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty.

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
I am willing to die...

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,440
for the greater cause.

82
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
Granted.

83
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,040
Before your mother left,

84
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
she entrusted you to Minister Xiao.

85
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
She said that...

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,840
if you ever discover your true identity,

87
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,720
I am to give you this letter.

88
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,880
My son, Xiao Ren.

89
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,400
As you open this letter,

90
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,120
may it feel as if I were there with you.

91
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,120
I kept this letter especially for you...

92
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,800
to tell you the truth.

93
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,799
Your father is innocent.

94
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,160
He has never betrayed the country.

95
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,720
I hope you will not blame him for the choices he made,

96
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
nor hold resentment in your heart...

97
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
for my departure.

98
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
You must understand...

99
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,159
that there are far greater matters in this world...

100
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,400
than personal affection.

101
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,280
I sincerely hope...

102
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,800
that you will take after your father...

103
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,239
and grow into a responsible,

104
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,280
courageous, and upright man.

105
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
Though I have passed,

106
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,960
I shall transform into a radiant star...

107
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,959
high above the sky,

108
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,640
forever watching over you...

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,560
and guiding you on your path ahead.

110
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,040
May you, my son,

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,440
have a smooth life,

112
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,719
filled with peace...

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,320
and joy.

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Your Majesty.

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,960
Situ Xing Yuan has amassed troops and stockpiled provisions,

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,160
ready to usurp the throne.

117
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,080
This is a grave matter.

118
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
The situation is urgent.

119
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,960
Please make a decision, Your Majesty.

120
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,919
Then let us go with the flow.

121
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,240
We will lure him into our trap...

122
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,279
and capture him and his treacherous confidants...

123
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
in one fell swoop.

124
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,880
I, Xiao Ren, accept your command.

125
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Xiao Ren.

126
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,160
Your entire Song family died loyal and brave.

127
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,096
You are the descendant of a loyal minister and a good general.

128
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Today...

129
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
was supposed to be your wedding day.

130
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,680
Yet you are implicated due to these past events.

131
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,600
Ultimately,

132
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
it was I...

133
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
who wronged your Song family.

134
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,520
I am not the descendant of a traitor.

135
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,160
My Song family has never committed treason.

136
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,160
I know.

137
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,080
My Song family has never betrayed the country.

138
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,920
My father has never betrayed the country.

139
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,240
Nine parts truth,

140
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
one part deception.

141
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,920
They will surely take the bait.

142
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Good.

143
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,040
I will go tomorrow morning.

144
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,520
Go get some rest. I want to study it for a while.

145
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,600
The entire Song family achieved great merit.

146
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,520
They were all heroes.

147
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,760
Since they were heroes,

148
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
they were destined...

149
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,800
to bear a heavy burden.

150
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Xiao Ren.

151
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Look at me.

152
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Xiao Ren.

153
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I am fine.

154
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,480
There is nothing for me to be aggrieved about.

155
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,440
I was born into the Xiao family.

156
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,800
I grew up in the Xiao family.

157
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,320
The first time I rode a horse,

158
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,520
it was Father who taught me.

159
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,440
Every time I was in danger, it was you who came to save me.

160
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,360
What does Song Lou's death have to do with me?

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,159
What do the Song family affairs...

162
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
have to do with me?

163
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
I know.

164
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,640
I know all that.

165
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,200
They did not let Southern Qing down.

166
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
But they let you down.

167
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,480
You can blame them.

168
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
I mean it.

169
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,200
Cry if you want to.

170
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,400
Let your feelings out.

171
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
It is all right.

172
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,720
I will always be by your side.

173
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Why...

174
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
were they so foolish?

175
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,240
It is fine.

176
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Why?

177
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Why?

178
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why...

179
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,640
did they leave me alone?

180
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Why?

181
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Why?

182
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,880
Why did they have to be heroes?

183
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,720
Why did they have to bear such disgrace?

184
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Lu Zhao.

185
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,680
What should we do next?

186
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Next,

187
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,120
it is time to lure Situ Xing Yuan into taking the bait.

188
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,400
He is very cunning.

189
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
This act...

190
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,360
must be convincing.

191
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,920
Stop right there, you animal!

192
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
You animal!

193
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,240
Get up now.

194
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Get up!

195
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Xiao Ren!

196
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
You poked and hurt me.

197
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,560
I cannot get up until you hug me.

198
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Get up.

199
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,160
There, there. Do not cry anymore.

200
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,640
My husband has such brilliant foresight...

201
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,040
and is equally wise and brave.

202
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,640
You are truly the head of the Xuntian Sect.

203
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,680
Just now, I almost believed you.

204
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
This act really...

205
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,639
satisfied Situ Xing Yuan.

206
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,240
He truly thought he was infallible.

207
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,160
But this mechanism you made is so clever.

208
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,840
Of course, Xuntian Sect's craftsmanship is exquisite.

209
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Let us go.

210
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,680
It is time to reel in the net.

211
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,840
Step back. Just watch me.

212
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Wow!

213
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,440
Master Xiao is so amazing!

214
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,319
It is such a big iron cage,

215
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,040
and he just went right at it!

216
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,200
Look at how brave and resourceful he is.

217
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,760
Look at this arm strength.

218
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Master.

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What are you...

220
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
doing?

221
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,760
What are you waiting for? Open the door!
