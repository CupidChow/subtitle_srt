1
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,080
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 11)

3
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Who goes there?

4
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,640
This is a robbery.

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
What robbery?

6
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
A...robbery...

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,080
A robbery of lust.

8
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Master Xiao.

9
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,719
Instead of being the sect leader,

10
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,000
you have stooped to being a bandit?

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
I just...

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,519
saw how beautiful you are...

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
and had this sudden impulse.

14
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,960
Why not come with me
and be my bandit queen?

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,280
We will have fun every day.

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Then may I ask, Master Xiao?

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,360
You just killed...

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,080
the spy Situ Xian planted
by my side.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
What am I supposed to do now?

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,880
No need to answer to anyone.

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,880
Kill one, replace one.

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Your favorite roast goose.

23
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,200
How is your injury?

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
You care about me?

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Never mind then.

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,360
As expected of Ms. Lu.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,040
My external injuries have healed.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,200
But it still hurts a bit inside.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Nonsense.

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
I do not have inner powers.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Go!

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,840
(Pilan Palace)

33
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Princess of Chu,

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,680
the first lesson at Pilan Palace...

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
is to sit here...

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
and quiet the mind.

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,360
One must sit for four full hours.

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,640
During this time,
no matter what happens,

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,600
do not move a step.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Your Highness,

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
please.

42
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,280
What arrogance.

43
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Four hours.

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
Ninth Uncle is no ordinary royal.

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Though he does not handle
worldly matters,

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,120
he oversees the etiquette
and education of the imperial clan.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,680
His sister, Princess Miao He,
was married off for the realm...

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
and tragically died
in Northern Qiang.

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
His Majesty feels guilty
towards him,

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,960
which is why
he always defers to him.

51
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,800
Let us meet him.

52
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,880
Such a large place,

53
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,920
why must you sit
in the middle of the pavilion?

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,400
Do you not see
the Heir-Prince of Ru'nan?

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,520
Move aside at once!

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,600
(The Heir of Prince of Ru'nan)

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,880
I was wondering who it was.

58
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Turns out,

59
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:02,480
it is the jinx who drove
her own father to his death.

60
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,720
How unlucky.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Get out of my way!

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Watch your mouth.

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,480
Insolence!
How dare you hurt His Highness!

64
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
You!

65
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
You, you!

66
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,800
How dare you act recklessly
in Pilan Palace!

67
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
Just you wait!

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,000
Pilan, adorned
with virtue and refinement,

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,080
is a place of pure cultivation
for the imperial clan.

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,840
(Situ Xing Yuan)

71
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,920
Who dares make such a racket?

72
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Ninth Uncle,
please judge with clarity.

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
I would not dare.

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
It is all because
of this wretched woman!

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,800
So arrogant and domineering.

76
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,720
At the slightest disagreement,
she ordered her guard to hurt us.

77
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Please, Uncle,

78
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,680
do justice for me!

79
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,200
It is you.

80
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,119
When I was young,

81
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,800
I followed the late emperor
to Jiangnan.

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,040
We met once.

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,999
Back then,
the daughter of the Lu family...

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,080
was gentle and virtuous,

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,640
gifted with both talent
and creativity.

86
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Now,

87
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
why have you changed so much?

88
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
To answer Uncle,

89
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,680
I am the rightful consort
of the Prince of Chu.

90
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,880
My words and actions represent
the imperial family's dignity.

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,160
Uncle, you just heard it.

92
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,480
This heir-prince was insolent.

93
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
How could...

94
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
I endure such humiliation?

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,280
Your guard has injured others.

96
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,760
He is to receive 20 lashes.

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
The Princess of Chu failed
in her duty of discipline.

98
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
You are punished to copy...

99
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
"Examples for Women"
100 times each day,

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,200
for a period of 10 days.

101
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,279
I was the one who gave the order.

102
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,400
He should not bear the whip.

103
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
I am willing
to receive the punishment.

104
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,440
Pilan Palace has its own rules.

105
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Rewards and punishments...

106
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,240
are not for you to meddle with.

107
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,000
I am willing
to accept the punishment.

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
As for you,

109
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,400
the Heir-Prince of Ru'nan,

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,280
you disrespected your imperial kin.

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
You are...

112
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,560
to receive 50 lashes.

113
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
This...

114
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,559
I do not mind these rumors...

115
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
or the slander of petty men.

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,920
Pilan Palace has many rules.

117
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,600
Next time, let us not resort
to fighting over mere words.

118
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
I cannot bear to see
anyone bully or insult you.

119
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,480
Did you live a very hard life?

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So many injuries.

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Are you...

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
concerned about me?

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was just thinking,

124
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,440
if your father and sister
in heaven saw this,

125
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,080
they would surely be heartbroken.

126
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Really?

127
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Yes.

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,440
This medicine will sting a little.

129
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Bear with it.

130
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,600
This is not an old scar.

131
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,600
To injure you like this,

132
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,560
the opponent must be formidable.

133
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,640
She is indeed formidable.

134
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,200
She almost took my life.

135
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
And she is the only one...

136
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,520
who can take my life.

137
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,560
I just applied the ointment.

138
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,640
You will tear the wound.

139
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,280
Let me help dress you.

140
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
For lash wounds,

141
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,680
nothing is worse than water.

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
You must exercise caution...

143
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
for the next few days.

144
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Sis.

145
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
What did you call me?

146
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,920
Chief, I am coming in.

147
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,880
Ms. Lu, you are here too.

148
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Yes.

149
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,920
You had better have something
very important to tell me.

150
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,839
These are all the official documents
of the Xuntian Sect today.

151
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,600
It took me great effort to sneak in
and show them to you.

152
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Is this...

153
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
considered very important?

154
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,040
What is the matter?

155
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,360
Why are you so angry?

156
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Why did I not notice it before?

157
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,000
Wielding a brush is more tiring
than wielding a sword.

158
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Why are you here?

159
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Take a break.

160
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,560
I will do it.

161
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
Master Xiao's hands...

162
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,760
are for wielding a sword to kill.

163
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
Copying "Examples for Women",

164
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
could you do that too?

165
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,800
What "Examples for Women"?

166
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,120
It is just a bunch of nonsense...

167
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,560
used to tie down women.

168
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,360
I often wrote it when I was little.

169
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
Why would you copy
"Examples for Women"?

170
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,320
I copied it for my sister.

171
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Very well.

172
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
You copy it.

173
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,160
Looking at him like this,

174
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
he is quite handsome.

175
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Sis.

176
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,520
What do I have to do...

177
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,320
to make you understand
how much I love you?

178
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
What are you doing?

179
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
I could not kiss you just now.

180
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,440
Let me make up for it now.

181
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
I...

182
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
You...

183
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Master Xiao.

184
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,840
We are just using each other.

185
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
No.

186
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,640
I never used you.

187
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Now that it has come to this,

188
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,559
I thought
you would understand my feelings.

189
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Understand what?

190
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,719
When Situ Xian proposed to me,

191
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,320
he was just as devoted.

192
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,640
Now, he is cold and indifferent.

193
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
A man's words...

194
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,800
are as light as weeds.

195
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,320
You were never his wife.

196
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,639
Never.

197
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
I do not care what you think.

198
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,640
Anyway, I have already died once.

199
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
I do not trust him.

200
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,960
Why should I trust you?

201
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Lu Zhao.

202
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,160
I am not like him.

203
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,600
Do not lump the two of us together,

204
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
all right?

205
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
So it is not that
you are indifferent to me.

206
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,920
You are just afraid
of being let down again.

207
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Am I right?

208
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Lu Zhao.

209
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,120
You do like me.

210
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,640
Seeds of longing?
