1
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,320
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 13)

3
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Lu Zhao.

4
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
What is it?

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,240
Did you not expect me to return?

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,480
Or did you not want me
to return at all?

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,680
When I heard you were seriously ill,

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,160
I even ignored the palace rules...

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,520
to rush back and visit you.

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,840
Who would have thought...

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,880
that you and my husband...

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,280
would get pregnant behind my back?

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,680
A child?

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
Your child?

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,440
How could you do this to me?

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
What are you doing?

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Lu Zhao.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,079
It was my idea.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,040
I wanted to bear an heir
for His Highness.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,320
I also did it
for your sake, Lu Zhao.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,560
If you want to hit someone,

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,080
hit me then.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
All right.

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Your Highness.

25
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,679
You don't want her to suffer.

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,159
Then you can suffer for her.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,240
- Lu Zhao, are you crazy?
- Yes.

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,960
I've gone crazy.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,680
I thought that since I came here,

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,720
I've behaved myself.

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,320
I even gave you all my assets.

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,800
But what about you two?

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,199
During my father's
mourning period...

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
and my training at Pilan Palace,

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,159
you had an affair with my cousin.

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,600
And you even got her pregnant!

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,879
You are the heartless one.

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,080
You're even worse than an animal!

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Lu Zhao.

40
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,880
You haven't been able to bear a son
in all these years of our marriage.

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
That's considered
ending the family lineage.

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,199
You drove your father to his death.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
That is a betrayal of virtue.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,800
You disrespect your husband.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,120
That is disrupting peace
in the family.

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,440
You refuse to accept my concubine.

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,960
That is jealousy.

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
You've committed four
of the Seven Grounds for Divorce.

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm already more than benevolent...

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,920
for not divorcing you.

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,320
How dare you try to divorce me?

52
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,880
Then I shall commit
all seven grounds...

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,440
with pleasure.

54
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,360
I'll sever all ties with you!

55
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Are you done making a scene?

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,720
That's enough.

57
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,240
What outrageous behavior.

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
Have you forgotten
the imperial family's dignity?

59
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,520
While your wife
was undergoing training,

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,320
you took in a concubine,
which violates propriety.

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,480
Even if Lu Zhao is at fault,

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
both her parents are deceased.

63
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,120
She has no home to return to.

64
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
You...

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,400
have no right to divorce her.

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Lu Zhao.

67
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,160
The Prince of Chu
is indeed at fault.

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,159
However, you are still childless...

69
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,880
and even tried to kill your husband.

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,240
You are no longer fit
to be the Princess of Chu.

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,880
You two were once husband and wife.

72
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,360
I do not wish to see you
become enemies...

73
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,160
and disgrace the imperial family.

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
I order you to divorce immediately.

75
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,760
From now on, you may each marry
whomever you want,

76
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,320
and you shall have nothing to do
with each other.

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,440
Thank you, Ninth Uncle.

78
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,160
You're right
to reprimand us, Ninth Uncle.

79
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
I will immediately...

80
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,800
draft the mutual divorce agreement.

81
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,200
Lu Zhao and I will part amicably.

82
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,400
Ninth Uncle, please allow...

83
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,080
Lu Zhao and I...

84
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,240
to say farewell in private.

85
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,520
Lu Zhao, are you willing to do so?

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Yes.

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
We should indeed...

88
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,040
part...

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,600
amicably.

90
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,200
I never sent a letter...

91
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,320
to Pilan Palace.

92
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,280
How did you know Xue Er was there?

93
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
You don't deserve to know.

94
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
(Husband: Situ Xian, Wife: Lu Zhao)

95
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,480
The divorce agreement is here.

96
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
If you want it,

97
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,600
come and get it.

98
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
(Divorce Agreement)

99
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
Ninth Uncle is outside.

100
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
How dare you be so presumptuous?

101
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
What?

102
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,040
Are you scared?

103
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
You know martial arts?

104
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,000
You are not Lu Zhao.

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Who are you?

106
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
(Divorce Agreement)

107
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,880
(Husband: Situ Xian, Wife: Lu Zhao)

108
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,280
I am Lu Zhao.

109
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,480
I'm also the devil
who has come for your lives.

110
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
By the way,

111
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,920
if I hadn't stopped in time,

112
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,479
I'm afraid...

113
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,120
we'd be preparing your funeral now.

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,360
Do you think having Xiao Ren
on your side...

115
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,040
and playing a few tricks...

116
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,720
can take me down?

117
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,360
Don't you know...

118
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,880
that soon enough,

119
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,960
Xiao Ren will personally
place you in my bed?

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,679
Then, you'll be begging me...

121
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
like a dog.

122
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,400
You'd better pray
that you can live a few days longer.

123
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,040
Otherwise, once you're dead,

124
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
your delusions will die with you.

125
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,360
Lu Zhao.

126
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Just you wait.

127
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,160
Let's see how long
you can be arrogant.

128
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,120
Thank you, Ninth Uncle,

129
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,000
for upholding justice for me.

130
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Lu Zhao.

131
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,720
From now on, you are no longer
the Princess of Chu.

132
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,400
You no longer need to return...

133
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,080
to Pilan Palace
for training with me.

134
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,520
Your goal of using me
to get divorced...

135
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,520
has been achieved.

136
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Ninth Uncle.

137
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
You...

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,080
I didn't expose you...

139
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,960
because you resemble Miao He.

140
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,720
But you must remember this.

141
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,680
If you gaze long into the abyss,

142
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,000
the abyss also gazes into you.

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,080
I hope you will be self-disciplined
and cautious in the future.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Take good care of yourself.

145
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,120
Princess Miao He?

146
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,520
She's Situ Xing Yuan's
deceased younger sister.

147
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
No wonder he was still willing
to help me...

148
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
even though he saw
through everything.

149
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,720
I, Xiao Ren,
pay my respects to Your Majesty.

150
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Good.

151
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,800
Great, Xiao Ren.

152
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,479
You captured the King of Nanzhao
in one fell swoop,

153
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,600
solving a major problem for me.

154
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,120
You risked your life...

155
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
on this journey.

156
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,640
I shall reward you handsomely.

157
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,520
I will grant...

158
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
whatever you desire.

159
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,320
I do have one request...

160
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,080
that I hope Your Majesty
can grant me.

161
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,560
Speak freely.

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
The criminal Liu Ming Fu
deceived Your Majesty...

163
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
and committed suicide.

164
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
His residence has been confiscated.

165
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,640
However, Liu Ming Fu's
daughter, Lu Zhao,

166
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
just divorced the Prince of Chu.

167
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:07,720
She is alone and helpless.

168
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I humbly request Your Majesty...

169
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,200
to return the residence to Lu Zhao.

170
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,960
That's all?

171
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Yes, that is all.

172
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Very well.

173
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,920
Granted.

174
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

175
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Let's go.

176
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
I'll take you home.

177
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,440
I don't have a home anymore.

178
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Yes, you do.

179
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,760
(Lu Manor)

180
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,680
Wasn't this mansion confiscated?

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
From today onward,

182
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,600
this is your home.

183
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,520
You no longer
have to be bound by anyone.

184
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,280
I've brought your nanny...

185
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,440
and your former servants
from the Liu household.

186
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
From now on,

187
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
you'll have
your elders and friends...

188
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
by your side.

189
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
And...

190
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,200
And...

191
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,160
what?

192
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Lu Zhao.

193
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,160
I didn't reclaim this mansion...

194
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,240
to trap you here.

195
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,360
If there's anywhere
you want to go...

196
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,640
or anything you want to do,

197
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,160
go ahead and do it.

198
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
I'll watch over things here.

199
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,960
I'll be here
whenever you want to come back.

200
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Thank you.

201
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Go and take a look.

202
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Okay.

203
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Aren't you coming in?

204
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,240
The people of the Xuntian Sect...

205
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
have too much blood on our hands.

206
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,439
All commoners
and even aristocrats...

207
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
avoid us.

208
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,679
Usually, when we visit
other people's homes,

209
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,720
we use the side entrance.

210
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,800
Whenever we use the main entrance,

211
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
it's usually...

212
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,840
for beheadings and confiscation.

213
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,120
You're moving
into your new home today.

214
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I'll just use the side entrance.

215
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Go on.

216
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Nonsense.

217
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
The Xuntian Sect
is His Majesty's sword.

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
The lives you take...

219
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,200
are to protect the people...

220
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,640
of this land.

221
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,120
You are not a bad omen.

222
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,440
Today, you helped me.

223
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,119
There are many others...

224
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
who will rely on you in the future.

225
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,600
That is the meaning
of the Xuntian Sect's existence.

226
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Xiao Ren.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If it weren't for you,

228
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
I can't imagine...

229
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,120
when I'd be able
to see the light again.

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Lu Zhao.

231
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,400
I know better than anyone
what you've endured.

232
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,320
You can start over now.

233
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,000
I just don't want you...

234
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,920
to get dragged into the filth again.

235
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,880
Are you sure you want to stay?

236
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

237
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Let's go.

238
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,240
(Lu Manor)

239
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Thank you.

240
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,320
I still have work to do
at the Xuntian Sect.

241
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
I'll go back first.

242
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Okay.

243
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Work is more important.

244
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,720
He has done so much for me.

245
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Shao Yao.

246
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,960
Is he injured?

247
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,320
He gets hurt all the time.

248
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,600
Miss, you don't have to worry.

249
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
The Liu manor was confiscated.

250
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,959
Unless His Majesty gave his consent,

251
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
there's no way
it could be reclaimed.

252
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I heard the good news
of the King of Nanzhao's capture.

253
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,360
He wanted to reclaim this mansion.

254
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,999
That's why he was so eager
to capture the King of Nanzhao.

255
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Am I right?

256
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,120
His actions...

257
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,320
and his thoughts...

258
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,840
I understand it all.

259
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Miss.

260
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
You don't have to worry so much.

261
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
A few years ago,

262
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Master brought back
an injured baby pigeon.

263
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,400
He cared for it meticulously
as if it were his own heart.

264
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,720
Until one day,

265
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,680
the pigeon grew up
and was about to fly away.

266
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,600
The previous master had just passed.

267
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
That pigeon...

268
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,680
accompanied the Master
through his toughest times.

269
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,280
Ling Su urged him...

270
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,040
to keep that pigeon.

271
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,440
But Master said...

272
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,040
that he couldn't bear to see it
trapped in a cage.

273
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,400
So he waited for a sunny day
to release the pigeon.

274
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,520
But do you know what?

275
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
That pigeon returned
that very night.

276
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,280
Because it had already decided...

277
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
that its home...

278
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
is wherever the Master is.

279
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
I suppose...

280
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,280
for a pigeon,

281
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
soaring to the sky
and returning to its nest...

282
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,960
are not in conflict.

283
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Miss.

284
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,720
Those who truly love you...

285
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,600
will firmly stand
on the path you choose.

286
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Lu Zhao.

287
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,880
I didn't reclaim this mansion...

288
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,760
to trap you here.

289
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,000
If there's anywhere
you want to go...

290
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
or anything you want to do,

291
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,280
go ahead and do it.

292
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I'll watch over things here.

293
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,960
I'll be here
whenever you want to come back.

294
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,240
He never stopped me
from taking revenge.

295
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,680
He never once put me in a dilemma.

296
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,160
Perhaps...

297
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,080
we've always been on the same path.

298
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Bad news, Ms. Lu.

299
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,840
Master Xiao suffered fatal injuries.

300
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,280
Commander Ling asks you
to go and see him quickly.

301
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
What?

302
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Xiao Ren!

303
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,720
I haven't had the chance
to tell you how I feel.

304
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,680
Please be all right.
