1
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,360
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 20)

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,999
I have reported Situ Xing Yuan's rebellion...

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to His Majesty.

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,479
His Majesty approved a special search warrant...

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,800
for the Xuntian Sect to arrest Situ Xing Yuan immediately.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,720
But our spy reported back...

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,640
that Pilan Palace is already empty.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,480
Situ Xing Yuan is missing too.

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,160
He must still be in the city.

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,200
Take a team of men and seal the city gates.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,240
Then take another team...

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
and search Pilan Palace from top to bottom.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,920
My jade pendant is still inside.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Yes.

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
I understand.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
I will leave now.

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,120
Why not rest a little longer?

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,200
Someone was hurt worse than me,

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
but still woke up earlier.

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,440
Since your memory has returned,

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,560
I will report to His Majesty...

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,399
and have him reinstate you...

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
as Xuntian Sect leader.

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Report?

26
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
How do you plan to report it?

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,840
Will you tell His Majesty...

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
that Xiao Jin Yu...

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
deceived him and faked her death?

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,680
Or that you used witchcraft...

31
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,080
to bring someone back to life?

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Xiao Ren.

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
I have made up my mind.

34
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,840
I will no longer take over the Xuntian Sect.

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,720
- Sis. - Listen to me.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,160
Since ancient times,

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,320
emperors have despised the arts of witchcraft and spirits.

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,320
This matter must be kept secret.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,880
You must not mention it to anyone.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,120
Besides, I think...

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,000
I am no longer as strong...

42
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,880
as I used to be.

43
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,320
I no longer have the strength...

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,360
to take over the Xuntian Sect.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Not to mention,

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
you are doing a better job than I am.

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
In the past,

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,520
I was always out fighting at the front,

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,400
while you stood behind me, keeping me safe.

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
From now on,

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
let me...

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,880
stay behind you and protect you.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
- Sis. - Stop calling me Sis.

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,320
We have been bound by that one word, "Sis,"

55
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
for so many years.

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
A sister...

57
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,800
cannot fall in love with her own brother.

58
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
But Lu Zhao can.

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,680
Lu Zhao can fall in love with Xiao Ren.

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
From now on,

61
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,200
I will no longer be Xiao Jin Yu.

62
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
I will only be your...

63
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Lu Zhao.

64
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
This is...

65
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
It is for Lu Zhao.

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,200
When I helped you,

67
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,000
I never thought...

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,880
we would share these eyes.

69
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,280
From now on, I will take you...

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,800
to see all the world's beauty.

71
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Actually,

72
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,360
I have known for a long time...

73
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,680
that you are not of the Xiao bloodline.

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,416
Back then, my mother gave birth prematurely...

75
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,480
to only one daughter.

76
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,680
Unlike what Father had claimed,

77
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,280
we were not twins.

78
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,520
So you knew all along too.

79
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
I did take out...

80
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,480
some of my anger on you.

81
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,520
When I learned the truth,

82
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,880
I asked Father...

83
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,840
why he was so biased.

84
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,320
But Father said...

85
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,640
the Xiao family must carry on its lineage.

86
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
It cannot end with his generation.

87
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
Otherwise,

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,840
he would fail our ancestors.

89
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,400
It was right here...

90
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,400
that I was forced to kneel and swear an oath.

91
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
For the sake of the Xiao family,

92
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,200
I must forever hide this secret...

93
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
and never reveal your background to anyone.

94
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,200
At first, I was resentful.

95
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
I hated...

96
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,320
that I was clearly of the Xiao bloodline,

97
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
yet when you came,

98
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,200
you took everything from me.

99
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
That is why...

100
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,240
I treated you against my heart...

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,360
and was deliberately cold toward you.

102
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,800
But you always put me first,

103
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
even risking your life...

104
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,480
for me several times.

105
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,240
I have never felt wronged.

106
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,840
Having you by my side is already a blessing.

107
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,560
Before the ancestors of the Xiao family,

108
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,839
I, Xiao Ren,

109
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,960
swear an oath from this day:

110
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,080
Through countless perils and hardships,

111
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,760
I shall never fail her.

112
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
May the ancestors show mercy,

113
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
and may this vow endure...

114
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
in this life...

115
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,760
and forevermore.

116
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,360
You desperately sought an audience with me.

117
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,720
For what purpose?

118
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,920
Ninth Uncle,

119
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I heard that...

120
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,960
Xiao Ren has now forced you into a corner,

121
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,040
like a homeless dog.

122
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
Let me out.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
I will kill him for you.

124
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,080
Given your current state,

125
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,000
how will you kill him?

126
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,640
With my life.

127
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,040
I can help you leave this place.

128
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
The old Song residence...

129
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,840
has been abandoned for years since Song Lou's treason.

130
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,520
No one guards it to this day.

131
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
I...

132
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,600
will have someone set up explosives there,

133
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,560
then lure Xiao Ren out.

134
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
The rest...

135
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
is up to you.

136
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,279
Speaking of which,

137
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,679
there is one more thing...

138
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,440
I think you should know.

139
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,880
Lu Zhao died at the birthday banquet a long time ago.

140
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,760
The current Lu Zhao...

141
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
is Xiao Jin Yu.

142
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
That girl was so delicious.

143
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,320
Her skin was so soft and smooth.

144
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,479
She must have grown up pampered.

145
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,719
Indeed.

146
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,799
When I held her,

147
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,080
she kept calling out, "Your Highness!"

148
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Could it be...

149
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,240
that we got to enjoy a princess consort?

150
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,639
After the Prince of Chu was deposed,

151
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,719
all the women in his manor became official prostitutes.

152
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,600
This girl looks like she ran away from there.

153
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Prince of Chu?

154
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,520
Why does that sound so familiar?

155
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,760
Is he not that eunuch prince from before?

156
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,400
That is him!

157
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
That is him!

158
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,240
Yes, yes.

159
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
Spare me!

160
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Spare me!

161
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,680
Where is she?

162
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
She...

163
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:20,200
is over there.

164
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,199
- No! - Xue Er.

165
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,439
- Stay away! - Xue Er.

166
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,120
No!

167
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Xue Er!

168
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Xue Er.

169
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,240
Xue Er, it is me.

170
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,880
Xue Er.

171
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
It is me.

172
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Xue Er.

173
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,840
Your Highness.

174
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Your Highness.

175
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Do you know where His Highness is?

176
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Can you take me to him?

177
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,120
Father and Mother...

178
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,720
are both dead.

179
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,800
My child is dead too.

180
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,560
I only have His Highness.

181
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,120
Take me to him.

182
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,480
Take me...

183
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Take me to him, all right?

184
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,480
His Highness could not even protect you.

185
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,160
Why are you looking for him?

186
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
Find him.

187
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,520
I will give him this amulet.

188
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,880
Then he will be safe for the rest of his life.
