1
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,280
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,560
(Episode 4)

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,639
You couldn't even keep an eye on a blind person.

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,000
Things could've been bad.

5
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

6
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:43,199
Greetings, Your Highness.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,519
My naughty daughter...

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,000
has caused you trouble.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,200
Father, what are you saying?

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
My dear.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,800
If you don't want to go back to the manor,

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,520
I won't force you.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,160
You can write a letter to the Lu family head in Jiangnan...

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,360
and ask him...

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,400
to transfer me the Lu family's fortune.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,360
I might be able...

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,880
to grant you a divorce.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,960
Dream on.

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
Don't blame me...

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
for not going easy on you, then.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,519
Bao Qin!

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,720
- Bao Qin. - Don't move.

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,400
How bold of your maid...

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,079
to trespass...

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,360
the Jingzhao Magistrate Office.

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,839
Do you know...

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,319
who the magistrate...

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,520
works for?

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
You've gone too far.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Ms. Lu Zhao.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,160
Don't worry about me.

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,599
The Lu family property is the ancestral inheritance...

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,480
left to you by the old master and madam.

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,400
You can't give it to this thief!

35
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,839
Bao Qin!

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,999
Bao Qin.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Bao Qin.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Bao Qin.

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,400
Bao Qin.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,960
Bao Qin.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,719
Why?

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,879
Why?

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,599
Why did you do this?

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,360
Why?

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,440
Bao Qin.

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,880
Mother.

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,879
Mother.

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
Father.

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,639
Uncle hit me.

50
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,839
Uncle.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,880
How could you hit your daughter so hard?

52
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,319
Xue Er. It's my fault.

53
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,400
Don't be mad at me.

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
"Daughter"?

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,640
All of you...

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Tell me.

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,840
How did you...

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
regain your vision?

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,800
The gods opened my eyes...

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
so that I could see...

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,560
your true colors, you demons.

62
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,839
You wench.

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
You're still stubborn even in the face of death.

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Lu Zhao.

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
If gods existed,

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,080
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,680
Just write the letter.

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,880
I'll give you...

69
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,760
a chance to live.

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,400
All right?

71
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Even if I die,

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,040
I won't let you have your way.

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,480
You don't know what's good for you.

74
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,240
I see you want to do this the hard way.

75
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,880
Lu Zhao.

76
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,720
Why are you doing this?

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,240
You're pregnant.

78
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,760
Do you want this child...

79
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,400
to die without ever seeing the world?

80
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,400
What has the child done wrong?

81
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
You're right.

82
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,120
I'm with child.

83
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Here.

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Write the letter.

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
Sign and seal it.

86
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,440
I'll make sure you and your son...

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
are safe.

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Untie me.

89
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
Your Highness.

90
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Hurry.

91
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:23,479
Summon the doctor.

92
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Summon the doctor!

93
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,520
Yes.

94
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,560
I won't be able to control her without the child.

95
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,440
Situ Xian.

96
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
You're extremely cruel.

97
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
With your blood running through it,

98
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,080
this child may one day become a menace.

99
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,200
You don't deserve to have my child.

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,360
Don't even think...

101
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,280
about using him to control the Lu family.

102
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Wench.

103
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
It turns out...

104
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,480
you've planned it all out.

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,200
You wench!

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Doctor.

107
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Doctor!

108
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,640
Where's the doctor?

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,920
Doctor!

110
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Your Highness.

111
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,840
The rouge you put on yourself...

112
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,520
is not red enough.

113
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,280
Let's see.

114
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,400
It's just right.

115
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,599
What's wrong?

116
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,240
Are you unhappy with the rouge I helped you apply?

117
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,840
I forgot.

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
You were given mute poison.

120
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,800
You can't talk.

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,279
Even if you're not happy with it,

122
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,480
you have to put up with it.

123
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,080
The guests will be here soon.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,480
Once the shackles are off,

125
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,639
your birthday banquet...

126
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,160
will begin.

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
After today,

128
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,399
if His Highness doesn't get your handwritten letter,

129
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,920
the lives of the Lu family...

130
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
will be in danger.

131
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,480
Lu Zhao.

132
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,040
You'd better...

133
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,920
behave yourself.

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Sis.

135
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,360
I know everything.

136
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,960
You and I are not twins by blood.

137
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,560
Judging by the time,

138
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm actually your older brother.

139
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,640
You've always protected me.

140
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
Let me protect you this time.

141
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,360
Don't worry.

142
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,840
For every drop of blood you shed,

143
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
and every pain you've suffered,

144
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,120
I'll make them pay a thousandfold.

145
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
No one can separate us.

146
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,360
Not even death.

147
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,520
The revival spell needs to be performed personally.

148
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,199
You need to use your blood...

149
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,399
to attract her soul.

150
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,559
If this works,

151
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,520
a blood-colored orchid will appear on her body...

152
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,839
to signal her soul's return.

153
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,839
But this spell defies Heaven and alters fate.

154
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,319
Whether you succeed or not,

155
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,039
you'll have to pay a huge price.

156
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,776
You can have no regrets, come life or death.

157
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,880
Have you made up your mind?

158
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
If I can get my sister back,

159
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,320
so what if I die?

160
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,440
Let's begin.

161
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,520
I pay my respects, Your Highness.

162
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,119
Your Highness.

163
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,320
Rumor has it...

164
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,479
that Her Highness is not of high birth...

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,839
and is blind.

166
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Despite that, you treat her like a treasure.

167
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,479
Now, to celebrate her birthday,

168
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,359
you've built Zhaoyue Pavilion.

169
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,439
You really are...

170
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,480
the most devoted lover in Ying.

171
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,879
Everyone.

172
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,680
Please don't tease me.

173
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
I'm ashamed to say this.

174
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,000
My dear caught a cold today.

175
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
She lost her voice temporarily.

176
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,080
It's my fault...

177
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,640
for not taking good care of her.

178
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Your Highness.

179
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Her Highness has arrived.

180
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

181
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,440
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

182
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,840
Don't make me break your legs.

183
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Start walking.

184
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,159
Everyone.

185
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,600
Let's have a toast.

186
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Cheers, my dear.

187
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,839
We pay our respects, Your Highness.

188
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,120
It's a happy occasion.

189
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,119
Officials.

190
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,719
The Prince of Chu is plotting a rebellion.

191
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,559
To steal the Lu family's assets,

192
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,360
he has raised an army... and harmed me.

193
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Today,

194
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:32,959
I'm risking my life...

195
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,440
to seek an audience with His Majesty.

196
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,519
I hope all of you can help me.

197
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,560
I poisoned her mute myself.

198
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,640
How can she still talk?

199
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,640
Go on.

200
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,120
I, Xiao Ren, made a vow...

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,760
to help me bring Sis back to life.

202
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,560
I'm willing to pay any price.

203
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,520
If any of you gods refuse,

204
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,600
I'll lay waste to every temple...

205
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,680
and crush every sacred statue.

206
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Situ Xian...

207
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,520
attempted rebellion.

208
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,640
That's high treason.

209
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,760
Are you just going to turn a blind eye to it?

210
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Say something.

211
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,320
Say something!

212
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Lu Zhao.

213
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,960
His Highness prepared this birthday banquet for you.

214
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,759
Do you think...

215
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,640
anyone could get in...

216
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,720
if they weren't His Highness' trusted aides?

217
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,480
You’re so stupid it’s pathetic.

218
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,880
You're disobedient.

219
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,040
You should know this.

220
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,120
Those who don't listen...

221
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,320
have to pay the price.

222
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,359
Situ Xian.

223
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,040
You bastard. What are you trying to do?

224
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm trying to teach you a lesson.

225
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,279
The hundred lives...

226
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,440
in the Lu family...

227
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,520
lie in your hands.

228
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
You know...

229
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,240
after I turn 18,

230
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,480
I'll inherit the Lu family's assets.

231
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,120
What you don't know...

232
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,120
is that if I die,

233
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,359
all the Lu family's assets...

234
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,840
will be handed over to the state treasury.

235
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
With such merits,

236
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:55,841
how dare you lay a finger on my family?

237
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
What are you doing?

238
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,319
Your Highness.

239
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Go after her!

240
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,559
Supreme Celestial Altar,

241
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,679
unceasing in all change.

242
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,799
May the three souls endure forever,

243
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,920
the spirit remain unbroken.

244
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,519
Talismans, heed my command.

245
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,599
Soul,

246
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
return!
