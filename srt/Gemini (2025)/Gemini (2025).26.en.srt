1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
(Gemini)

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
(Episode 26)

3
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,880
Your Majesty! Bad news, Your Majesty!

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,296
Prince of Huai has rebelled and breached Wu Gate!

5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
He's heading this way!

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Brother.

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,440
At this point,

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,840
there's no need to pretend to be diligent, is there?

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
After all,

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,320
your time on this throne is finally over today.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Xing Yuan,

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,680
you've done this eventually.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,280
If Xuntian Sect hadn't always ruined my plans,

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
this day...

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
might have come sooner.

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,240
You are my youngest brother.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,280
Since childhood, I've treated you...

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,160
differently from others.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,960
I thought...

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,440
that we'd never be the ones...

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,280
to wield swords at each other.

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,080
At this point,

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,800
is there still a need for such hypocritical pretense?

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Xing Yuan.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,560
Have you ever considered...

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,360
if the way you are now...

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,296
is what Miao He would want?

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Shut up!

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,039
You don't deserve to mention Miao He.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
It's all because of you.

31
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Because of your cowardice,
Miao He died!

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,280
And it's also because of you...

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,280
that I've been pushed to this point.

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,800
Now the situation is settled.

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280
The entire imperial palace is under my control.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,880
You are nothing but my prisoner.

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,360
What right do you have to stand here and criticize me?

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,040
I kowtowed to my ancestors...

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,560
and received the Edict of the Late Emperor.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,600
I ascended the throne with honor.

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,440
In terms of status,

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,720
I am the Son of Heaven.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,280
In terms of familial order,

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
I am your elder brother.

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
Why can I not...

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,160
admonish you?

47
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,240
As a ruler or a brother,

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
you...

49
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
are unworthy.

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,520
Do you truly believe you can win?

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
Can't you read the current situation?

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,120
The Xuntian Sect is now a heap of loose sand.

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
You,

54
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,000
have no one left to use.

55
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Is that so?

56
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
Your Highness, be careful!

57
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Jin Lin!

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,016
I've come late to Your Majesty's rescue.

59
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,320
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
How dare you...

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,520
team up to deceive me?

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Situ Xing Yuan.

63
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,920
You've always manipulated hearts,

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,040
but you underestimated sincerity.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,160
No one can sow discord...

66
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,160
between Lu Zhao and me.

67
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Even so,

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
so what?

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,119
Now the entire palace...

70
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,240
is filled with my people.

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,120
None of you will escape.

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,200
I want all of you to die with Miao He.

73
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,200
Don't you understand?

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,440
The map I gave you...

75
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
seems harmless on the surface,

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,120
but it contains a secret.

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,336
All the elite soldiers you've brought into the palace...

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,119
have already been rounded up...

79
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
by the Imperial Guards.

80
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
Situ Xing Yuan,

81
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,800
don't even think about it.

82
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,880
This is a trap with no escape.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,120
A trap with no escape?

84
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,039
If I can't leave the palace...

85
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
within two hours,

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,040
The city of Ying will be wiped out.

87
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Xiao Ren,

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,879
do you dare to gamble with me...

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,200
over the lives of an entire city?

90
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,240
Your hidden army of 50,000 men...

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
has been annihilated.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Now,

93
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,360
you're powerless.

94
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
Situ Xing Yuan,

95
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
surrender.

96
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,240
You want me to surrender to him?

97
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Dream on.

98
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,320
Even if I die here today,

99
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,560
I'll drag him to hell...

100
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,080
and make him kowtow to Miao He.

101
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
This,

102
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,400
it is what you owe me.

103
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Situ Xing Yuan,

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,440
you have no way out.

105
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,800
How laughable.

106
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,999
Who do you think you are,

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,920
loyally serving your emperor?

108
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,000
Does your emperor know...

109
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,720
you are Song Lou's son?

110
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,760
Who is he?

111
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,880
How could I not know?

112
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,440
Back then, the late Sect Master Xiao...

113
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,600
adopted Xiao Ren...

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,360
under my secret edict.

115
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Xing Yuan,

116
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,160
Song Lou is not a traitor.

117
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,240
He is a meritorious subject of Southern Qing.

118
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,199
How do you think...

119
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,920
the Five Cities of Yongzhou were recovered?

120
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,360
The entire Song family sacrificed themselves.

121
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,199
Song Lou endured humiliation,

122
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,440
infiltrated Qiang...

123
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,800
as a spy, and achieved it.

124
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
No.

125
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,280
That's not true.

126
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,920
Why didn't I tell you?

127
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,560
It concerned the loyalty of the entire Song family,

128
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,279
the fortresses of the five cities,

129
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,456
and tens of thousands of people.

130
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,240
How could I tell you?

131
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,800
Before the five cities were recovered,

132
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
you requested to leave the palace...

133
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,000
and move to Pilan Palace.

134
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,120
I visited Pilan Palace several times,

135
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
wanting to reveal the truth to you.

136
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,520
But you chose...

137
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,320
to shut me out,

138
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,640
refusing to see me again.

139
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,240
You claimed...

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,480
to seek justice for Miaohe...

141
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,600
and peace for Southern Qing,

142
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,920
but look at what you've done.

143
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,720
Colluding with the Qiang people...

144
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,760
and harming loyal subjects.

145
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,480
Your actions...

146
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
What's wrong?

147
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,800
How is this different from treason?

148
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Xing Yuan,

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,240
do you know...

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
what Miao He...

151
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,640
truly died for?

152
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
What do you mean?

153
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,720
When Miao He went to Qiang for a marriage alliance,

154
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,640
she learned that Song Lou...

155
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,880
could no longer send back military intelligence.

156
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,360
So she swallowed the confidential document...

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,040
and died willingly to relay the message.

158
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,200
Song Lou then incited the Qiang people...

159
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,400
to send her body back to Ying.

160
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,680
It was thanks to this document...

161
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,479
that we were able...

162
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,920
to reclaim the five border cities.

163
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
No...

164
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,000
Absolutely impossible!

165
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
See for yourself.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,040
Miao He...

167
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
It's Miao He's handwriting.

168
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Brother,

169
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,160
do not regret or grieve over my death.

170
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,840
As a princess of Southern Qing,

171
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,056
I have been provided for by the people since childhood.

172
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,720
I have no regrets in this life...

173
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,880
to be able to sacrifice for my country.

174
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,960
For the greater good,

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,800
I cannot be buried in the imperial mausoleum.

176
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,520
The land of Southern Qing...

177
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,560
is my resting place.

178
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,920
I have only one request.

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,679
One day, should Xing Yuan...

180
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,160
ever go astray,

181
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,600
I hope that you will...

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
give him a chance to correct his mistakes...

183
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,440
for the sake of my unwavering loyalty.

184
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
That way,

185
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,240
I can rest in peace...

186
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,400
in the netherworld.

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,160
At that time, you desperately pleaded with me...

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,440
to see Miao He one last time.

189
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,640
How could I not understand your feelings then?

190
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
But Miao He already had her stomach opened...

191
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
to retrieve the letter.

192
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,599
In front of Qiang's envoy,

193
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,920
how could I open the coffin?

194
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,560
I prided myself on my intelligence,

195
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,560
but I was merely blinded.

196
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,360
With all the scheming,

197
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,600
my entire life...

198
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,360
is nothing but a joke.

199
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,440
I have promised Miao He,

200
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,840
so I will not kill you today.

201
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,640
From now on,

202
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,680
you will forever remain in Pilan Palace.

203
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,720
Dead or alive, you may not step out of the palace gates.

204
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,840
A caged rat, clinging to life.

205
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,600
Why not die?

206
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Xing Yuan!

207
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Can you...

208
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,920
call me...

209
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,000
Brother?

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I'm not her.

211
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,760
It's finally over.

212
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,000
Xiao Ren? Xiao Ren!

213
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Xiao Ren...

214
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,160
Xiao Ren, what's wrong?

215
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Xiao Ren?

216
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
How is he?

217
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,560
Master is very weak.

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,320
He lost too much blood this time.

219
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
Will he wake up? When will he wake up?

220
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,360
It's probably up to fate.

221
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
I see.

222
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,136
Master is blessed with good fortune.

223
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,880
I'm sure he'll wake up.

224
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes. Maybe he'll wake up tomorrow.

225
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
The issues at the Imperial Palace are yet settled.

226
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,240
Xuntian Sect cannot function without a leader.

227
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Ling Su.

228
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,320
Xuntian Sect is counting on you from now on.

229
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
I will not fail my mission.

230
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
You can both leave.

231
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Xiao Ren.

232
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Tell me,

233
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,280
do the red ones look better...

234
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,560
or the white ones?

235
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,320
I think the white ones.

236
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
The stem is much longer than last time.

237
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
It looks good.

238
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Put this in for me.

239
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,480
I'll count to three.

240
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,000
You have to get up.

241
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
One.

242
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Two.

243
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,200
I, Xiao Jin Yu, have taken many lives in my life.

244
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,840
Naturally, I'm not afraid of gods.

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
May all gods and Buddha bless...

246
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,520
that Xiao Ren wake up soon.
