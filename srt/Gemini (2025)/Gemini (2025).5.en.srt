1
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,280
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,560
(Episode 5)

3
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,360
Stop her!

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
You lied to me.

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,079
You humiliated me.

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,120
You betrayed me.

7
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,640
I curse you all to have a miserable death.

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
- Save her! - You will be denied...

9
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:03,839
reincarnation in death.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,240
If there's a next life,

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,280
I will skin you alive, tear your tendons,

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,080
and reduce your bones to dust.

13
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,800
This is bad. The formation is broken.

14
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,119
Tell me.

15
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
What's going on?

16
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,679
Perhaps, while I was casting the spell,

17
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,479
someone else bound to Master Xiao by fate...

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
offered their life as a sacrifice...

19
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:57,719
to call to her.

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,119
Thus, the Master's soul...

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,159
went astray,

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,800
and she was resurrected through a corpse.

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,720
Resurrected through a corpse?

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Where is she?

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
If Master...

26
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,560
has possessed someone's body,

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,199
I... I'm afraid...

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,440
she's lost all her memories.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,960
Amidst this vast crowd, she’s lost all memory.

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,800
How am I supposed to find her?

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,760
On the left shoulder of the person Master possessed,

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,159
a blood-colored orchid will bloom.

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
If we use this as a guide,

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,080
we can find Master's real body.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,120
I'll find you.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
From heaven to hell,

37
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,440
you can't hide from me.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,120
(Xuntian Sect)

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Chief.

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
Chief.

41
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,560
The Emperor has issued an order.

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,400
You'll take over as the master of the Xuntian Sect.

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,920
Alright.

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,279
If you don't eat or sleep,

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,680
your body won't be able to take it.

46
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
If you collapse,

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
who will avenge Master Xiao?

48
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,920
Has Sis had such a hard time before?

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
By the way,

50
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,880
there's something else I want to tell you.

51
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,119
A while ago,

52
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,560
the Princess of Chu slipped and fell at her birthday banquet.

53
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,696
But there was no funeral at the King of Chu's manor.

54
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,200
Our spy just sent us a tip-off today.

55
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,959
The Princess of Chu, who was bound to die.

56
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
Actually came back to life.

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Is this true?

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Yes.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,239
Perhaps, while I was casting the spell,

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,720
someone else bound to Master Xiao by fate...

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,599
Thus, the Master's soul...

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,839
went astray,

63
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,159
and she was resurrected through a corpse.

64
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,639
I've given my orchid jade pendant...

65
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,920
to the Princess of Chu, Lu Zhao.

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,400
I promised to help her.

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,680
Is she alive?

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,000
How... How is that possible?

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,720
The fall at Zhaoyue Pavilion didn't kill her.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
They said she looked dead.

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,119
I don't know what happened,

72
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,520
but she suddenly came back to life.

73
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,519
It's just that...

74
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,880
she hasn't regained consciousness.

75
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
How persistent.

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
But it's better this way.

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,840
We wouldn't want a delay in His Highness' plans.

78
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,520
It's just that...

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,320
I can't bear this anger inside me.

80
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,119
That's right.

81
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,559
She humiliated His Highness...

82
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,880
in front of so many people.

83
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,400
She deserves to die.

84
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,159
Tell me.

85
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,120
When a person falls from a high place,

86
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,439
it's inevitable for them...

87
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,160
to break their bones and get disfigured.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Am I right?

89
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,280
You're right.

90
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,680
I'm on it.

91
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
Xiao Jin Yu.

92
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,400
Where am I?

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,560
Xiao Jin Yu.

94
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Who are you?

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Who am I?

96
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
With my body,

97
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,560
I sustain your soul.

98
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,320
From now on,

99
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,440
You are me.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,040
Lu Zhao.

101
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,000
Lu Zhao?

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,280
When you wake up,

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
your past will be gone.

104
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,960
When it's gone,

105
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
you will live as me.

106
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,640
You will have my memories.

107
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
That includes...

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,640
my hatred.

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
Where will I go then?

110
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,400
With body and soul divided,

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,480
the future remains uncertain.

112
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,840
If you want to regain your memories...

113
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
and find your true self,

114
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,920
you need to let go of your attachments.

115
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,800
My attachments?

116
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,560
Remember.

117
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,760
Let those who wronged others reap what they sow.

118
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,120
Bring total ruin to the traitor, in both body and honor.

119
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
A divorce letter...

120
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,640
shall appease the departed.

121
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,360
Sis.

122
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
Why did you take so long to cut her face?

123
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
Keep it down.

124
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,880
You're giving me a headache.

125
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,480
You... Lu Zhao.

126
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,840
You...

127
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,400
You killed Du Juan.

128
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
It's you.

129
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,560
Since you're so worried about her,

130
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,960
why don't I send you to be with her down there?

131
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
You're not Lu Zhao.

132
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,440
You can't be Lu Zhao.

133
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,279
Who are you?

134
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
Who am I?

135
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,320
Of course, I'm an evil spirit from hell.

136
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,960
Didn't anyone tell you?

137
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,520
If you do too many bad things,

138
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
you'll see ghosts.

139
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,919
From now on,

140
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,280
I'll be your nightmare.

141
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
I'll make you...

142
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:58,800
sleep restlessly every night.

143
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,200
Go to hell!

144
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Liu Ying Xue!

145
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
What are you doing?

146
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Your Highness.

147
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,680
She... She's a ghost!

148
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,160
Your Highness!

149
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,399
She killed Du Juan.

150
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,720
She tried to kill me too.

151
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,359
Save me, Your Highness!

152
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,400
I didn't!

153
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,000
Your Highness.

154
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Your Highness.

155
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Your Highness.

156
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
My dear.

157
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Your Highness.

158
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,120
I had a splitting headache as soon as I woke up.

159
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,440
I don't remember anything.

160
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,080
Do you really not know...

161
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,200
how you got hurt...

162
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,840
and how you ended up here?

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,840
Do you not remember anything?

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,640
I don't remember anything.

165
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I only remember...

166
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,800
that you're my husband.

167
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
What about the body?

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
When I woke up,

169
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
I saw...

170
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
a dark shadow...

171
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:14,479
darting past the window.

172
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Then,

173
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,520
a knife flew by.

174
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,400
I was so scared.

175
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,159
That lady...

176
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,319
came running in.

177
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,359
She said...

178
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,839
I'm the killer.

179
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,160
She wants me to pay with my life.

180
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,439
Your Highness.

181
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I'm scared.

182
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,559
You're lying.

183
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,600
That's not true.

184
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,279
You killed Du Juan.

185
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,720
- You even tried to kill me! - Miss.

186
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,600
I... I'm just a lady.

187
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,600
How could I kill someone with a knife?

188
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
Why would you accuse me?

189
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,040
You wench!

190
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,280
You wench!

191
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Are you done?

192
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,040
- Come here. - Your Highness.

193
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Your Highness!

194
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,880
It's a blow to the neck.

195
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,680
It's an instant death.

196
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,360
This is a common technique used by assassins.

197
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
But you said it was Lu Zhao's doing.

198
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,760
Go back to your room.

199
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,679
Don't cause any more trouble.

200
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Wait.

201
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,600
She said...

202
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,400
there was an assassin in her room.

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,560
Why don't you ask her...

204
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,000
where the assassin is?

205
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Your Highness.

206
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Stay in your room.

207
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Don't leave.

208
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
My dear!

209
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:59,000
My dear.

210
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,640
- My dear. - Your Highness.

211
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Calm down.

212
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,320
I'll be right back.

213
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,360
Be careful, my dear.

214
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Your Highness.

215
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:15,960
My dear.

216
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Your Highness.

217
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Your Highness.

218
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,680
Since you're here,

219
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,120
why don't you show yourself?

220
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
She still has the moves.

221
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,440
However, her inner power is gone.

222
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Sis.

223
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,520
It really is you.

224
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Who are you?

225
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Princess of Chu.

226
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,279
I'm a friend, not an enemy.

227
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm here to help you.

228
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,040
Help me?

229
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,120
Why are you helping me?

230
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,159
The jade pendant you're wearing...

231
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,720
was given to you by Xiao Jin Yu, the master of the Xuntian Sect.

232
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Seeing the jade pendant is like seeing the master.

233
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,040
It's my duty to help you.

234
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Besides,

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,400
we have a common enemy.

236
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,640
Situ Xian.

237
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,200
That's right.

238
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,399
The Xuntian Sect has been secretly investigating...

239
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Prince of Chu's collaboration with the enemy.

240
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,959
If you don't want to get involved,

241
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,160
I can send you away right now.

242
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,080
No. I won't leave.

243
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
I want them to pay for what they did.

244
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,799
I want those who deceived me...

245
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,000
to pay for what they did.

246
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Traitors...

247
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:39,280
will be ruined.

248
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,520
The enemy of my enemy...

249
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,200
is my ally.

250
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,560
Let's seal the oath with a handshake.

251
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,159
As of today,

252
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,520
our partnership begins.

253
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
From now on,

254
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,080
I'll be your sword.

255
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Wait.

256
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
What's your name?

257
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,000
Xiao Ren.

258
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,760
The same "Xiao" as Xiao Jin Yu,

259
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,920
and "Ren" as in "towering and limitless".

260
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,999
What does this orchid...

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
signify?

262
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,960
With body and soul divided,

263
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,760
the future remains uncertain.

264
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,000
If you want to regain your memories...

265
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
and find your true self,

266
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,880
you need to let go of your attachments.

267
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,360
Is breaking free from my attachments...

268
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,560
the only way to reveal the other secrets?
