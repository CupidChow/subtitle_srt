1
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,000
Stop her!

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,960
You all lied to me.

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
You humiliated me.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,360
You betrayed me.

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,640
I curse you to suffer a horrible death...

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,280
and be barred from rebirth.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
(Xuanming Gate)

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,880
If there's a next life,

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,080
I'll skin you alive...

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,560
and grind your bones into ashes.

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,000
(Gemini)

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,120
(Episode 1)

13
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,800
Xian.

14
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
For this kind of thing,

15
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,000
between my cousin and me,

16
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,360
who do you prefer...

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,200
to do it with?

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,760
You're still thinking about that woman at this time?

19
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
What?

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,400
Have I not done well enough?

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Your Highness.

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,679
His Highness has been busy...

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,816
overseeing the construction of Zhaoyue Pavilion lately.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,496
His Highness specifically instructed us...

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,336
to send someone to find him at Zhaoyue Pavilion...

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,720
if you need anything.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You didn't have to come all the way here yourself.

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,280
I want to give him a surprise.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Bao Qin.

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,560
Just wait for me here.

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Your Highness.

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Your Highness.

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
My dear.

34
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Why are you here?

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,840
Your Highness has been busy with work lately.

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,480
I brought some snacks for Your Highness to try.

37
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,560
I don't know if you'll like them.

38
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
My dear.

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,440
The weather has been cold lately.

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,256
Your blindness makes things difficult for you.

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,560
From now on, let the servants...

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
do these things from now on.

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,279
You're supervising the construction...

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,720
of Zhaoyue Pavilion for my birthday.

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,120
What I'm doing is nothing by comparison.

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Thank you, my dear.

47
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
My dear.

48
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Let me help you.

49
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
What's wrong, Your Highness?

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
It's nothing, my dear.

51
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
I accidentally...

52
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,160
bumped into the corner of the table.

53
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Your Highness.

54
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,960
I especially asked someone...

55
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,000
to get these famous snacks from Jiangnan.

56
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
I had them urgently delivered.

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Your Highness.

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Try it.

59
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
- Here. - Thank you, my dear.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My dear.

61
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Did you get burned?

62
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
I'm fine.

63
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,560
I'm blind, so I couldn't see the candle.

64
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,056
That's how I accidentally burned myself.

65
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Let me take a look.

66
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,960
Is it serious?

67
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Your Highness.

68
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm fine.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
My dear.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What's wrong?

71
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,240
Are you feeling unwell elsewhere?

72
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
I'm not unwell.

73
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Your Highness.

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Your Highness...

75
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,480
is going to be a father.

76
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
That's great, my dear.

77
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm going to be a father.

78
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,400
The weather has been cold lately.

79
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,880
Now that you're pregnant,

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,056
you have to take care of yourself.

81
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Let's go.

82
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,616
I'll take you back to your room.

83
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Okay.

84
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Your Highness.

85
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,480
What was that sound?

86
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
It's all right.

87
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,400
Stray cats often knock over things at night.

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
It's not a big deal.

89
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Let's go.

90
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,080
The weather is getting colder.

91
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
It's unbearable.

92
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,320
Lately, there have been more and more Qiangs in the capital.

93
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,560
We'd better watch out.

94
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
The Qiang people?

95
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,536
We don't need to be afraid of the Qiang people.

96
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Did you see this?

97
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I can kill two at once!

98
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Xun...

99
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
The Xuntian Sect.

100
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,680
(Xiao Ren)

101
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,999
- Let's go! - Go!

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,080
Run!

103
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,360
(Imperial Dovecote)

104
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,320
Where are you taking the weapon plans...

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,600
of the Ministry of Military Provisions?

106
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,800
Who are you?

107
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,840
I'm the guard of the Imperial City...

108
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
and the inspector of the officials.

109
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,000
I have special permission...

110
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,200
to take action without His Majesty's consent.

111
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,840
I am Xiao Ren of the Xuntian Sect.

112
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
Remember my name.

113
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,680
Send my regards to Hades.

114
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Sis.

115
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,480
How many times do I have to tell you?

116
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,216
We are government officials when we're at work.

117
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
We are not siblings.

118
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Yes, Master.

119
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,440
I've found the arms traffickers.

120
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,800
This is the latest information from our spies.

121
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Wipe your face.

122
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Liu Ying Xue...

123
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
The Princess of Chu...

124
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,120
A secret affair and harem infighting?

125
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,720
We have three spies in the Prince of Chu's manor,

126
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,240
yet this is all they've found out?

127
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,040
Situ Xian is cunning and very alert.

128
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,040
It's hard for our men to get close to him.

129
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
But I was thinking,

130
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,040
since we can't send someone in,

131
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,480
why don't we get someone from the inside?

132
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,320
Let's make use of the conflict in their home.

133
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,440
(The Princess of Chu is pregnant)

134
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Tomorrow,

135
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,560
after we deal with the arms traffickers,

136
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,200
we'll look for an opportunity...

137
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,520
to meet this Princess of Chu.

138
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Bao Qin.

139
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Bao Qin.

140
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,280
I'm the only one...

141
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,800
who shall give birth to His Highness's child.

142
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
You don't deserve it.
