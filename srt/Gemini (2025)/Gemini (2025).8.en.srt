1
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,559
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 8)

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,000
Could it be...

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,840
that you're interested in me?

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,160
What if I say yes?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What can you do?

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,160
I like intelligent and brave women.

8
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,840
Apart from my sister,

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,040
you can be considered...

10
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,840
the most outstanding woman in the world.

11
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,840
Today, in court,

12
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
I saw that you hate Situ Xian to the core.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,080
Why is that?

14
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,920
Because he killed my sister.

15
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,400
I want him to pay for it a thousand times over.

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
What kind of person...

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,960
was your sister?

18
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,640
It's so cold.

19
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,680
Sis.

20
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,399
You clearly...

21
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,440
hate me so much.

22
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,560
Why don't you abandon me?

23
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Shut up.

24
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,720
Our parents are dead now.

25
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,879
You're the last family member...

26
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,240
I have left in this world.

27
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,520
I won't give up on you.

28
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Never.

29
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,880
Sis.

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
I am afflicted by several poisons.

31
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,359
If you take me with you,

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,400
you won't get out of Wandu Mountain.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
No.

34
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,080
Without my permission,

35
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
you can't give up,

36
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:35,360
you can't die.

37
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,040
I'm going to find the Golden Silkworm to cure you.

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,199
If you close your eyes now,

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,240
I'll never forgive you.

40
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Xiao Ren!

41
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,000
I found the Golden Silkworm!

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,440
You're saved.

43
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,720
Take it quickly.

44
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,120
Get lost!

45
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,280
All of you, get lost!

46
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Go away!

47
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,559
Believe it or not,

48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,520
I'll kill you all!

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Come out!

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,400
If you want to hurt Xiao Ren,

51
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
you'll have to step over my dead body!

52
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,360
Come on!

53
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,920
I'm not afraid of you!

54
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,159
I won't let you...

55
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,840
hurt Xiao Ren!

56
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,320
We'd been through so much together.

57
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
I'd always thought,

58
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,480
as long as I'm alive,

59
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,200
as long as I'm alive in this world,

60
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,560
she would never be alone.

61
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Who would have thought...

62
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,560
that she would die before me?

63
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
Your sister treated you so well.

64
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,560
She wouldn't want to see you sad.

65
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
I haven't taken revenge yet.

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,080
I don't have time to be sad.

67
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,600
My sister uprooted Situ Xian's weaponry supply.

68
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,039
He has no choice but to secretly manufacture weapons

69
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
with the Qiang people.

70
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,320
Now, he urgently needs military funds.

71
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,120
Your Lu family's assets...

72
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,319
I'm afraid...

73
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
he's determined to get them.

74
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
He wants my family's assets?

75
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm overjoyed.

76
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,640
If he doesn't want them,

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
I'll have to find a way to make him want them.

78
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,360
Alright.

79
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,960
Do whatever you want.

80
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,360
- I'm here. - You'll protect me, right?

81
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Don't be envious.

82
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
You have it too.

83
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Get lost.

84
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,200
Shao Yao, come quickly.

85
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,240
The roast goose your master brought...

86
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
is really delicious.

87
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
It suits my taste.

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Ms. Lu Zhao,

89
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,480
only the roast goose suits your taste?

90
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
What about the one who brought it?

91
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
Do you like him?

92
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,320
Your master...

93
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,599
possesses exceptional abilities...

94
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,640
and extraordinary courage.

95
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
He's a good partner.

96
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Who wouldn't like him?

97
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Miss Lu.

98
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,680
Master is a man of great character.

99
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,776
He's not only worth cooperating with,

100
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,440
but also someone to entrust your life to.

101
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Don't you have...

102
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,200
any interest in him at all?

103
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,280
What kind of person he is has nothing to do with me.

104
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,520
I won't entrust my life...

105
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,960
to a man.

106
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,080
We're just using each other.

107
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Chief.

108
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Chief.

109
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Don't be sad.

110
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,680
Even if Miss Lu is using you,

111
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,560
I'm truly sincere about you.

112
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,480
Wait for me. Why are you walking so fast?

113
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,080
Miss Lu, Lord Liu is here.

114
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,640
He's waiting for you in the main hall.

115
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Father.

116
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Lu Zhao.

117
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
- Father. - Lu Zhao.

118
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,360
What brings you here?

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,639
I've come here...

120
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,320
to ask for a favor.

121
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
We're family. There's no need to be formal.

122
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Just tell me.

123
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,480
Come on, have a seat.

124
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Lu Zhao,

125
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,599
then I'll get straight to the point.

126
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Okay.

127
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Your aunt...

128
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:00,719
drowned to death.

129
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
It wasn't a peaceful end.

130
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
At the funeral,

131
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,639
her eldest daughter should carry...

132
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,960
the white banner for her peace.

133
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
But now,

134
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,920
Xue Er has fallen ill.

135
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,600
Only you can send her off.

136
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Is this...

137
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,360
appropriate?

138
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,080
After all, I'm already married.

139
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Don't worry.

140
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,960
I've already instructed everyone...

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,520
to keep the funeral simple.

142
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
I understand, Father.

143
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,440
Then I will...

144
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
do my filial duty...

145
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,800
for my aunt.

146
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,600
Your aunt must be able...

147
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,320
to rest in peace...

148
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,440
after seeing you come to send her off.

149
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Yes.

150
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Rou Er,

151
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,640
rest in peace.

152
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,520
I'll take good care of our daughter.

153
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Your Highness,

154
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,296
we've offered the pear cakes...

155
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,600
and poured the sacrificial wine.

156
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,680
This funeral is complete.

157
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Aunt,

158
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,120
pear signifies departure.

159
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
With the pear cake eaten,

160
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,640
and the farewell wine drunk,

161
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,760
may you rest in peace.

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,640
Lu Zhao,

163
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,520
you must finish this half of the pear cake...

164
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
for the ceremony to be complete.

165
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Rou Er,

166
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,640
rest in peace.

167
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,399
No matter what sacrifice I have to make,

168
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,079
I'll do my best...

169
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,520
to protect Xue Er.

170
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,480
I'll find out who's behind Lu Zhao...

171
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,040
and send them all to hell,

172
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,760
to comfort your departed soul.

173
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,600
Aunt,

174
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
the road to hell is not easy.

175
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,920
Don't worry...

176
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,160
because I'll soon send someone to accompany you.

177
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,800
The funeral ceremony is complete!

178
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
There are bandits!

179
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,520
Master...

180
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Hurry!

181
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Pretend to be dead.

182
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,400
Pretend to be unconscious.

183
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,400
I am the Princecess of Chu.

184
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
Who sent you?

185
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,520
How dare you lay hands on me?

186
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
A princess?

187
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,720
On this mountain, I am the emperor!

188
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,599
You're pretty.

189
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,240
If you serve me well,

190
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,040
I'll make you the empress!

191
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
After her!

192
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Don't run!

193
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Get up.

194
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,720
Lu Zhao has a powerful ally...

195
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,320
behind her.

196
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,760
This way, I can lure out the person behind her.

197
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,880
Keep a close eye on the cliff.

198
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,880
When someone comes to save her,

199
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,440
force them to jump off the cliff.

200
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Master.

201
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,680
There's Jishui Pond at the bottom of Fox Tail Cliff.

202
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,280
Even if they fall,

203
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,120
they might not die.

204
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,479
What if they escape during the chaos?

205
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,760
They can't escape.

206
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,840
I've already put...

207
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,519
the most potent love poison...

208
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,600
in Lu Zhao's pear cake.

209
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,359
Once they jump off the cliff,

210
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,920
report to Prince of Chu to search below the cliff.

211
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,480
Then, with the two of them alone in the wilderness,

212
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,000
in the throes of passion,

213
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,320
that's when we'll catch them red-handed.

214
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,280
Master, you're brilliant.

215
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Why did you stop running?

216
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,320
One more step back,

217
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,920
and you'll be in the abyss.

218
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
How about you...

219
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:56,000
just be my wife?

220
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,040
How dare you!

221
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
How dare you kill my men?

222
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,960
Jump! Why aren't you jumping?

223
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,719
I'm going to make you all die!

224
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,000
- Let's fight our way out. - No.

225
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Do you trust me?

226
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Jump.

227
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Shoot!

228
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Your Highness!

229
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Your Highness, something bad has happened.

230
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Where's Lu Zhao?

231
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:25,879
Why are you the only one who rushed back?

232
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Where's my wife?

233
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,760
The caravan encountered bandits on the roadside cliff.

234
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Her Highness...

235
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,119
was cornered by the bandits...

236
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
and fell off the cliff.

237
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,920
How did you do your job?

238
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,400
I've heard that...

239
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,040
the Lu Clan Chief is on his way to the capital.

240
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,400
If Lu Zhao dies...

241
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,720
at this critical moment,

242
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
I'll kill your whole family!

243
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Your Highness, please calm down.

244
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,216
I heard there's a pond at the bottom of the cliff.

245
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,960
Even if Her Highness falls, she'll be fine.

246
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
I request that Your Highness send men forthwith to search for her.

247
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,480
Pass on my orders at once.

248
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,520
Go down to Fox Tail Cliff...

249
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,040
and search for Lu Zhao.

250
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,760
If you can't find her,

251
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,640
bring your heads to me!

252
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Yes, Your Highness.

253
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
What's wrong with you?

254
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Why is she so hot?

255
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,520
She looks like she's been drugged.

256
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,360
Take off your wet clothes.

257
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,120
I'll light a fire for you.

258
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,200
You've been drugged with love poison.

259
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
It's the Spring Cage Lock.

260
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
How to detoxify?

261
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,240
As long as we...
