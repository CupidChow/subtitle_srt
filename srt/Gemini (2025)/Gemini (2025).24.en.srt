1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
(Gemini)

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
(Episode 24)

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,640
Why are you telling me this now?

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,800
Because I can't bear to lose you.

5
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Fame,

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
wealth,

7
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
even life and death,

8
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
I don't care about any of it.

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Only you.

10
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,440
I want to marry you.

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,880
I want a wedding with you.

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
I want to be with you...

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,360
for the rest of my life.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,680
It's all true.

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Lu Zhao.

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
I...

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,680
The Song family is guilty.

18
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,680
I've wronged the Xiao family.

19
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
I've let Southern Qing down.

20
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,680
I've wronged you.

21
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,040
Take my head to His Majesty,

22
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,240
and he won't punish the Xiao family.

23
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
I only ask...

24
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
that after I die,

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,680
you won't hate me.

26
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,040
Get out!

27
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Father.

28
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
What should I do?

29
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
Why should I swear
to our ancestors...

30
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,760
to keep his identity a secret?

31
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
He doesn't deserve it.

32
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,640
You are the eldest daughter
of the Xiao family,

33
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,760
the future leader of Xuntian Sect.

34
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
How can you be so narrow-minded...

35
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,080
to judge people by their bloodline?

36
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Xiao Ren...

37
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,240
was raised by me.

38
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,440
He grew up in the Xiao family.

39
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
He ate our food,

40
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
learned our principles,

41
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,600
and followed our ways.

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,760
What does that have to do
with his bloodline?

43
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,320
Why are you still here?

44
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Are you waiting for me...

45
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,680
to kill you myself?

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,680
If my death...

47
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,160
can quell the hatred
between our families,

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,760
I'll die with no regrets.

49
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
I won't kill you.

50
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,720
Your identity and bloodline...

51
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
were not your choice.

52
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Bearing this hatred...

53
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,840
isn't what you wish for.

54
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,120
The feud between our elders...

55
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
has nothing to do with you.

56
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Lu Zhao.

57
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,040
Song Lou murdered the commander,

58
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
betrayed the country,
and joined the enemy.

59
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,520
He is the Xiao family's sworn enemy.

60
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
One day,

61
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,920
I will kill him with my own hands...

62
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
to avenge the bloodshed.

63
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
When that day comes,

64
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
if you dare to stop me,

65
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
I will kill you.

66
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,720
I will not stop you
from seeking revenge.

67
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Don't worry.

68
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,720
I will not disgrace the Xiao family.

69
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,960
I will go to the palace now...

70
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
and tell His Majesty the truth.

71
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
I will accept his judgment.

72
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,000
Have you thought this through?

73
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
I am willing to forgive you,

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
but His Majesty may not.

75
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
You might not return...

76
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,720
from this journey.

77
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Lu Zhao.

78
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,480
Since I bear this bloodline,

79
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
I must bear this responsibility.

80
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,360
It's just a pity.
Tomorrow is our wedding day.

81
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,480
I've ruined everything.

82
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,040
You still remember that tomorrow
is our wedding day.

83
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,320
If you leave now,

84
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,600
Situ Xing Yuan will
become suspicious.

85
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Stay here.

86
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,840
The wedding will proceed as planned.

87
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Lu Zhao.

88
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,800
I am the son of a traitor.

89
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
The Song family's crime...

90
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
implicates the entire clan.

91
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,040
Are you sure you want to marry me?

92
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,600
I've made up my mind.

93
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,280
I will not blame you.

94
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Tomorrow,

95
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,640
we will perform the wedding rites...

96
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,160
and drink the nuptial wine.

97
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,520
After our wedding ceremony,

98
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,000
as your wife,

99
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
I will go to the palace with you.

100
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,400
If His Majesty insists
on executing you,

101
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,920
I will follow you to the afterlife.

102
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,800
As husband and wife...

103
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,920
We'll live and die together.

104
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
What is this about?

105
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,480
It's their wedding night,

106
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
but they're not here.

107
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,920
They made us
take their places in here.

108
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Quiet. Just shut up.

109
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,640
Walls have ears.

110
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,960
Don't worry, no one will hear.

111
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Even with the help
of three wisemen...

112
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
he'd never expect...

113
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,880
those two to leave
on their wedding night...

114
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
to seek audience with the Emperor.

115
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,960
This mission is secret
and dangerous.

116
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Master trusts us.

117
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
That's why he arranged this.

118
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,120
We cannot be negligent.

119
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,480
Come closer to me.

120
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,920
Why are you so far away?

121
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,360
Don't give us away.

122
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Okay.

123
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
What are you waiting for?

124
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Come closer.

125
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,280
We're newlyweds now.

126
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Ling Su,

127
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,960
why is your face so red?

128
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Is it?

129
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,680
Perhaps, it's too hot.

130
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
It's the middle of winter.

131
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
How is it hot?

132
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Behave yourself.

133
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,400
We're still on a mission.

134
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
I know.

135
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,680
You've come here
to confess everything...

136
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,360
without any fear of death.

137
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,200
For that, I am deeply gratified.

138
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
You may rise.

139
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
Your Majesty.

140
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
Now that it's come to this,

141
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,840
there are some matters...

142
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,800
I should tell you.

143
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Xiao Ren,

144
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,720
I have long known...

145
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,360
about your true identity.

146
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,240
Speaking of which,

147
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,840
it all started with that great war.

148
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,840
Back then,
Situ Xian's maternal clan...

149
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,080
embezzled military supplies,

150
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,120
leading to a great defeat
at the border.

151
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,720
Southern Qinging lost
five cities in a row.

152
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,560
Hundreds of thousands of civilians
and soldiers were massacred.

153
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,480
That battle...

154
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,160
resulted in horrific casualties.

155
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,120
By the end of the war,

156
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,960
General Xiao and his strategist,
Song Lou,

157
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
were at their wits' end.

158
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,120
General, hang in there.

159
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,520
The Five-City Defense Chart
has fallen into enemy hands.

160
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,680
We must find a way to send
the message back.

161
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,280
The Qiang pursuers are upon us.

162
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,680
I cannot leave.

163
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,880
But this old life of mine...

164
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
still has one last use.

165
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Strategist.

166
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:55,720
- Yes!
- We must protect the people.

167
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,120
There is only one way now.

168
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,960
You must kill me...

169
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,600
and feign surrender.

170
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Infiltrate the enemies!

171
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
No.

172
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
General!

173
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,720
If anyone must die, it should be me.

174
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,920
I am but a scholar.
My death is of no consequence.

175
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,880
The Xiao family has guarded
the border...

176
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
for four generations.

177
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,200
We have fought the Qiang people
for generations.

178
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
If I surrender,

179
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,120
they will not believe me.

180
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,040
But it's different for you.

181
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Song Lou,

182
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,080
you are clever and cautious.

183
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Your strategies are exceptional.

184
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,320
They do not know your true identity.

185
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
You must...

186
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
General!

187
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,000
You must...

188
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,280
retrieve the Defense Chart...

189
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,640
and reclaim the five border cities!

190
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,560
- General...
- This is...

191
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,440
my final military command.

192
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Hurry.

193
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,800
General, please reconsider!

194
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Kill me.

195
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
General...

196
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,040
General, please reconsider!

197
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,840
Do it!

198
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,040
I, Song Lou,

199
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,880
shall do as you command!

200
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,840
In his personal armor,
General Xiao had carved...

201
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,800
his command for Song Lou
to feign surrender.

202
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
That had relayed the message.

203
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,880
Inside the armor was Song Lou's
blood vow and a jade token...

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,360
of love with Madam Song.

205
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,400
He said he didn't fear death...

206
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,440
but only asked
that I save his family.

207
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,920
I, Song Lou personally killed
the commander myself...

208
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,280
to prove my defection.

209
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,800
I pledge allegiance to Qiang.

210
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,760
I'll offer my service to Qiang.

211
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,800
I pledge allegiance to Qiang.

212
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,440
I'll offer my service to Qiang.

213
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,560
I pledge allegiance to Qiang.

214
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,360
I'll offer my service to Qiang.

215
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
General Xiao,

216
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,080
I, Song Lou, hereby swear,

217
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
if I don't reclaim the five cities
of Southern Qing in this life,

218
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,120
I'd rather be a beast than man!
