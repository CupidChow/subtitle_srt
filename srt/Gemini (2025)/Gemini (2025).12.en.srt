1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,320
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 12)

3
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,360
(Dyehouse)

4
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,440
Thank you, Ninth Uncle.

5
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
You have to dye...

6
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,200
all these fabrics.

7
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,840
For your training here
in Pilan Palace,

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,400
cultivation of virtue is paramount.

9
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,640
Only by personally experiencing
the people's hardships...

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,440
can you truly empathize with them...

11
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,200
and nurture a heart that loves them
as your own children.

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,120
I will heed Ninth Uncle's teachings.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Good.

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,240
This Ninth Uncle,

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,880
who exactly is he?

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
You wretched woman!

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,000
You caused me to receive 50 lashes.

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,040
Today, I will slash your face!

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Shall I kill him?

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,520
I am the Heir-Prince of Ru'nan!

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,920
How dare you harm me?

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
If you cut him down now,

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,200
his blood will stain
my newly dyed fabric.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
I do not like it.

25
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,199
Kill him with poison.

26
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,280
As you command.

27
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
Open up.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,919
Die now or die later?

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,400
I will let you choose.

30
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,919
What poison did you give me?

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,960
Seven orifice poison.

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
In one year,

33
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,120
you will bleed to death
from all seven orifices.

34
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Princess of Chu,

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
I was wrong.

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
I dare not do it again.

37
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,320
Please give me the antidote.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I promise.

39
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,120
I will not bother you again.

40
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,680
I just heard someone wanted
to slash my face.

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Someone did say that.

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Was it you?

43
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Your Highness.

44
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,200
I was blind and did not know better.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,280
Please, Your Highness, spare me.

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
I...

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,080
I dare not do it again.

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,560
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,680
Given your sincerity,

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
I will spare you.

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
After you return,

52
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,479
build 10 charity halls...

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,199
to provide congee daily
and help the people.

54
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
After one year,
I will give you the antidote.

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,999
Certainly, I will go back now...

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to arrange
for the charity halls to be built.

57
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,039
What pill did you give him?

58
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,200
A soothing and nourishing pill.

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
I thought...

60
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,800
you were usually indifferent
to such rumors.

61
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,560
Why are you so angry today?

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Because he got you lashed 20 times.

63
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Your Highness.

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,080
Pilan Palace strictly forbids
entry and exit at will.

65
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,760
Moreover, I am an outsider.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,319
If our actions...

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
are discovered,

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
I am afraid it would be improper.

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,599
You are the Lu Clan Chief
of Jiangnan,

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
and my father-in-law
just passed away.

71
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,640
Consider it a solace
to the Princess Consort.

72
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Yes.

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,320
Your Highness,
Her Highness's chambers are ahead.

74
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,519
So you got angry...

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
because of me?

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,720
So what if I was?

77
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Lu Zhao.

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
You like me.

79
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,760
Master Xiao,
you have crossed the line.

80
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
So,

81
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,320
is the line between us gone now?

82
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Your Highness.

83
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,240
Lu Zhao.

84
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Your Highness.

85
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Why are you here?

86
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,120
I know you are suffering here.

87
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,800
I have missed you greatly.

88
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,080
So I came to visit you.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,320
Thank you for your concern.

90
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,120
I am doing well.

91
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Who is this?

92
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
This is...

93
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,040
the Lu Clan Chief of Jiangnan.

94
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

95
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,279
Please rise, Clan Chief.

96
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

97
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,720
I heard you are training
at Pilan Palace.

98
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,159
It is inconvenient for you
to be out in public.

99
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,919
After discussing it
with His Highness,

100
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,120
I brought the draft
of the documents here.

101
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,120
Please take a look.

102
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,599
(The land located
in the northern village...)

103
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,080
(Management of land use...)

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,480
Clan Chief,
you are truly thoughtful.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,520
You have solved
a big problem for me.

106
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,119
Now, I can be...

107
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,240
as one with you.

108
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Lu Zhao.

109
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,640
To have you as my wife...

110
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
is truly...

111
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
the greatest blessing of my life.

112
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,520
(Lu Zhao)

113
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Lu Zhao.

114
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Here you go.

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,999
After you hand over the inheritance,

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,880
you will die.

117
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,000
You covet my things?

118
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
I am afraid
you will not live to take them.

119
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,400
Just press your thumbprint on it.

120
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
All right.

121
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,520
(Lu Zhao)

122
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,080
(Lu Zhao)

123
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Lu Zhao.

124
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,440
You are now training
at Pilan Palace.

125
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,040
When your training is over,

126
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,920
I will personally take you home.

127
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,480
All right?

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
Thank you for your kindness.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No matter how hard it is for me,

130
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,800
I will gladly endure it.

131
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Then,

132
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
I will return home first.

133
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Take care, Your Highness.

134
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I am leaving.

135
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,679
What are you doing here?

136
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,679
Master,
Situ Xian is here with his men.

137
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
They are almost at the door.

138
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Go quickly.

139
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Too late.

140
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,960
When Situ Xian gets
your family's wealth,

141
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
he will remake weapons.

142
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,680
But he no longer dared to recruit
people from the Southern Qing.

143
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
When the time comes,

144
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,160
I am afraid he will have
to work with the Qiang people.

145
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,640
We must catch him in the act.

146
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,479
The Northern Qiang
and Southern Qing...

147
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,840
have a blood feud between them.

148
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,559
As an imperial member,

149
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,040
he dares to collude
with the Qiang people?

150
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Back then,

151
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
the traitor Song Lou...

152
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
marched with General Xiao into
battle against the Northern Qiang.

153
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,120
Did he not swear loudly
of his loyalty and righteousness?

154
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Yet in the end,

155
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,879
he slew General Xiao
with his own hand...

156
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,960
and became a traitor to his state.

157
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,400
Once people harbor illicit desires,

158
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
they will stop at nothing.

159
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
He thought he got
the Lu family's fortune.

160
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,160
But he did not know it was
a life-threatening talisman.

161
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
It is time...

162
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
to end this farce.

163
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Yes.

164
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,320
How is Liu Ying Xue doing?

165
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,800
She has already stopped pretending,

166
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,680
acting as though she is
the rightful princess consort.

167
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,119
She is so obsessed
with preserving the pregnancy...

168
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
that she grows more deranged
and sensitive.

169
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,679
It is time...

170
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,839
I return home to visit...

171
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,560
that poor cousin of mine.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,080
I have an important matter.

173
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,440
I would like to see Ninth Uncle.

174
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
What is it?

175
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
My family is gravely ill.

176
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,120
I am worried sick.

177
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
That is why I overstepped.

178
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,559
Please, Ninth Uncle,

179
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,240
allow me to return and visit her.

180
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,760
You know the rules of Pilan Palace.

181
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,800
During training,
you are not allowed to leave.

182
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I just received a letter
from my family.

183
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,760
They said my cousin is bedridden.

184
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,480
She has been ill for days.

185
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,640
If my cousin were
to pass away with regrets,

186
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,880
and I did not visit her in time,

187
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,480
I would be heartbroken.

188
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
And I would be letting down...

189
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,160
my aunt in the afterlife.

190
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,320
Ninth Uncle has always taught me
to prioritize virtue.

191
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,519
If my loved ones
are at death's door...

192
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,760
and I turn a blind eye,

193
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,160
how can I speak
of filial piety and virtue?

194
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,319
If Ninth Uncle worries
that I might lie in disgrace...

195
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,679
and never return,

196
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,840
then I boldly ask...

197
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
that Ninth Uncle...

198
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,480
accompany and oversee me.

199
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,000
If that is the case,

200
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,040
I will go with you.

201
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Wait.

202
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Your Highness.

203
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,960
Is this the medicine for Xue Er?

204
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Yes.

205
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,160
It is the medicine for Ms. Liu.

206
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
I will deliver it to her.

207
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,880
Your Highness.

208
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,280
Staying in bed to protect
the pregnancy is really boring.

209
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,240
Can you keep me company every day?

210
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,320
Have I not...

211
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,360
always been by your side?

212
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,440
This plum is sweet and sour.
It is really delicious.

213
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,640
Sour for a boy, spicy for a girl.

214
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Our baby...

215
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,560
must be a boy.

216
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,120
Then,

217
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
from now on,

218
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:18,520
you have to feed me
medicine every day.

219
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,360
And talk with our son.

220
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,520
Of course.

221
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,120
(Lofty manner and admirable grace)

222
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Who is it?

223
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:37,960
Which presumptuous servant is it?

224
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Ninth Uncle.

225
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Why are you...
