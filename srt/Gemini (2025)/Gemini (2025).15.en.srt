1
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,440
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 15)

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,960
Do not come closer!

4
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
I will not...

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,760
I will not let you touch my savior!

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
Savior?

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,560
I am going to kill you!

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You wench!

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,880
How dare you kill your husband?

10
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,600
Xue Lian, fear not.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,040
If the good do not contend,

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,080
they will only yield
the way to the wicked.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you fear him,

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,720
you will be forced to kill yourself.

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
If you are not afraid,

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,240
then he is nothing.

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Look.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Fighting back...

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
is not that hard.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
You wench!

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,480
What do you want?

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,600
Are you really going to kill me?

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,320
I will gut you!

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,800
You are right.

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,760
I want to kill you!

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
For the past seven years,

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,560
you forced me to go out every day
to earn money for you.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,760
When things did not go well,
you hit me and scolded me.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,320
And you even sold me off
to be humiliated.

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,440
An animal like you...

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,520
deserves to die!

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
He is dead.

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,800
I killed him myself.

34
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
My savior.

35
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,200
Thank you for bringing me back
and freeing me.

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
I was able to get my revenge.

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
That wench must have escaped home.

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,960
- Come on, search the place!
- Search the place!

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
They are here to silence me.

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,879
You should go.
I do not want to drag you down.

41
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,360
Stay here. I will deal with them.

42
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
- My savior...
- Stay put.

43
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Come out!

44
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,720
Where is she? Speak!

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
I do not know. Please spare me.

46
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
How dare you?

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Who gave you the guts...

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
to set up a private brothel...

49
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
and disregard human lives?

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you have a death wish?

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Tell me.

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Who is your master?

53
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,960
He is no ordinary fighter.

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,680
He hid poison in his teeth.
He is a suicide warrior.

55
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,720
How did you end up provoking him?

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,040
When I was buying hairpins,

57
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,280
I noticed that my seeds of longing
had fallen off.

58
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,080
Since you were buying
sweet glutinous rice balls,

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
I went to look for it.

60
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,999
In the end, I bumped into a girl...

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,080
who escaped from a secret brothel.

62
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
And at the very end,

63
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,840
it is as you see.

64
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,520
You are not mad, are you?

65
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Sorry to keep you waiting.

66
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,079
Next time you encounter
something like this,

67
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
just tell me.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Eat it while it is hot.

69
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
It will get cold soon.

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,320
I will clear up these bodies.

71
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
All right.

72
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,760
After I was sold off,

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,040
I was blindfolded
by the human broker.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,320
They took me
on a long carriage ride.

75
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,560
I even walked a long way
through a secret passage.

76
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
When I got out
of the secret passage,

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,520
I found myself
in an underground secret brothel.

78
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,160
I could not bear such humiliation.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,280
When the guards were not looking,

80
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,960
I hid beneath the carriage
where the bodies were hidden.

81
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
That is how I escaped.

82
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Do you remember...

83
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,120
what was above the secret brothel?

84
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
I do not remember.

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,080
I hid beneath the carriage.

86
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
I did not dare to speak,

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,320
much less look around.

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
However,

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,440
I vaguely glimpsed
through the cracks...

90
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,000
and saw a few rows
of big red lanterns.

91
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,000
Big red lanterns?

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Jifang House.

93
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,480
That is the Qiang people's
favorite teahouse.

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
There is something off...

95
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
about these Qiang people.

96
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,720
I will send my men there now.

97
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
We will surround and wipe them out.

98
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
No.

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,560
I heard from those inside...

100
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,120
that the secret brothel
was filled with explosives...

101
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
and full of traps.

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
If you force your way in,

103
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,359
the mechanisms
will trigger automatically,

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,720
and it will be blown
to pieces at once.

105
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,479
You are not thinking
of sneaking in there...

106
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,800
and rescuing them yourself, are you?

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
My savior.

108
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,800
It is very dangerous in there.

109
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I am familiar with the brothel.

110
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
If anyone has to go,
it should be me.

111
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Master Xiao.

112
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
What should we do then?

113
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
I will go with you.

114
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
Master, a girl escaped
from the pavilion today.

115
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
I have sent men
to pursue and kill her.

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
So useless!

117
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,400
If this happens again,

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,400
you will have to pay
for it with your life.

119
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Yes.

120
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Arrange for a new batch of girls.

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,160
Make sure our guests
have a good time.

122
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Yes.

123
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Chief.

124
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
We found the human broker.

125
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
The black market sent word...

126
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,480
that they are sending in
new girls tonight.

127
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
Prepare some rouge
and embroidery work.

128
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Move!

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hurry up!

130
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Get moving!

131
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Faster!

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Move!

133
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,840
Faster!

134
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,120
There are beauties.

135
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,280
I have a lot of money.

136
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
I want to buy all of them.

137
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Get lost!

138
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Do not get yourself killed.

139
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,000
If you know what is good for you,
scram!

140
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,760
Sir, I failed to recognize
your standing.

141
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,760
I will leave now. At once.

142
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
The carriage is coming.

143
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Check their blindfolds again.

144
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,919
One, two, three, four, five,

145
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,080
- Wear your blindfolds properly!
- six, seven,

146
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
- Behave!
- eight, nine, ten, eleven,

147
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
twelve.

148
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,920
I remember I caught 10 girls.

149
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,600
Why is it 12 now?

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,480
Two more people
mean two more payments.

151
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Move out!

152
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Keep up and move faster!

153
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Go.

154
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,960
Move, hurry up.

155
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Hurry up. I'm talking to you.

156
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,440
- Behave!
- Move your feet.

157
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Get moving!

158
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,440
Why is this path so familiar?

159
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
- Go!
- Come on.

160
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Hurry up!

161
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
And this smell...

162
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,520
Could this place be...

163
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Zhaoyue Pavilion?

164
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
- Stay close!
- Faster.

165
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,320
Later,
when our honored guest comes,

166
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,080
you must treat him well.

167
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,560
If our honored guest
is even the slightest dissatisfied,

168
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,040
I will tear your face off.

169
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Do you understand?

170
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
My little beauty.

171
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,640
My little beauty.

172
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
Stop hiding.

173
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,080
Come out and play with me.

174
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Come on out,

175
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,160
little beauty.

176
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,560
Where are you?

177
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,960
If I catch you,

178
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,280
I will punish you, yes?

179
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
- This way.
- My little beauty.

180
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,040
My little beauty, where are you?

181
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,880
Are you playing
hide-and-seek with me?

182
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,400
Do not let me catch you later.

183
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Hush.

184
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Hush.

185
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,880
Do not laugh.
If you do, I will kiss you.

186
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
So this is the Qiang leader
hiding in Ying.

187
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,560
He must be today's honored guest.

188
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,800
You cannot kill him here.

189
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,239
- My little beauty.
- Otherwise,

190
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
we cannot interrogate him.

191
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
- You are still laughing?
- Where are you?

192
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,840
I will stall him here.

193
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
You go find the gunpowder.

194
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
You?

195
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,240
- What? Can't I?
- My little beauty.

196
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,320
- Okay.
- If I find you,

197
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,119
there will be a punishment.

198
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
I am going.

199
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,240
Come out, my little beauty.

200
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Honored guest.

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,440
Are you looking for me?

202
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
So tasty!

203
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,280
They really picked
a tasty one for me this time.

204
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,959
- Beauty.
- Hush.

205
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,760
Do not be nice to me.

206
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Honored guest,

207
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
slow down.

208
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
All right.

209
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,640
Come here, my little beauty.

210
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,080
- Very well.
- Good wine goes well with beauties.

211
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Do not run!

212
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Hey, pretty lady.

213
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,880
We all call the madam
of the secret brothel...

214
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
"Mother."

215
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,440
If any of the new girls
refused to take clients,

216
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,040
she would hand them over
to her men...

217
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
to be abused and killed.

218
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,640
She likes to drink
when she checks the books.

219
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,960
She also has
a special enamel wine set.

220
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,480
There are guards
stationed on her floor.

221
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Why are you so slow?

222
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,800
- Mother is getting impatient.
- Forgive me, I am useless.

223
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,360
Mother asked me
to bring her a jar of wine.

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,280
- Go upstairs.
- Yes.

225
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Mother.

226
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,960
I have brought you some wine.

227
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Come in.

228
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Mother.

229
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,240
Where did you hide the gunpowder?

230
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Who sent you?

231
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,240
You do not deserve to know.

232
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,760
Then no one will be there
to bury you!

233
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,040
If you dare make a sound,

234
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,840
I will pierce your throat.

235
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,760
Can you tell me now...

236
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,360
where the gunpowder is hidden?

237
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,400
I will tell you.

238
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,640
The gunpowder
is hidden behind this wall.

239
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,200
That candlestick is the trigger.

240
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,840
The gunpowder is hidden in the room.

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,759
Are you not afraid of blowing
yourself up if it goes off?

242
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,159
My master hired a specialist
to design the secret room.

243
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,720
As long as it is not forced,

244
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
it will not go off accidentally.

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
How do we destroy the mechanism
controlling the gunpowder?

246
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,000
The candlestick's wick is
the fuse for the explosives.

247
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
All you have to do...

248
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,480
is pull it out.

249
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Who is your master?

250
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,160
I... I really do not know.

251
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,760
He always wears a mask
when he comes.

252
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,600
I have never seen his real face.

253
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
You do not know?

254
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Then you are useless.

255
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,560
I was right.

256
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,520
My goodness.

257
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,240
No way.
