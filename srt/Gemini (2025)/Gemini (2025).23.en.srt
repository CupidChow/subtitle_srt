1
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,360
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,520
(Episode 23)

3
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,960
"Zhaoyue Pavilion."

4
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Your Highness,

5
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,920
you truly foresaw it.

6
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,360
Lu Zhao really did notice
something unusual.

7
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,680
I have already reminded her...

8
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
as you instructed.

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,720
She was in charge
of the Xuntian Sect for so long.

10
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,079
If she did not notice
that Xiao Ren was acting strangely,

11
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
that would be truly odd.

12
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Your Highness is wise.

13
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
This is what you wanted.

14
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,520
Our deal is done.

15
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,000
I hope you, Ninth Uncle,
will keep your promise.

16
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,880
How do I know
if this map is real or fake?

17
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,359
Your wife...

18
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,800
is naturally sharp and vigilant.

19
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,799
Master Xiao, why not tell us...

20
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,960
how you got it?

21
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,320
Lu Zhao and I are already married.

22
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,800
Naturally,
she keeps nothing from me.

23
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
What is wrong?

24
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
The Empress Dowager's birthday
is approaching.

25
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,760
I have to personally arrange
the imperial city's defenses.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,359
When is a good time for you...

27
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,240
to draw up the defense map
for my reference?

28
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,800
I have already drawn it.

29
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,159
It is on that bookshelf,

30
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,879
in the box on the second row.

31
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,360
Just take it.

32
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,040
Sleep a little longer.

33
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Lu Zhao.

34
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
I am sorry.

35
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,639
Master Xiao is truly heartless.

36
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,119
Newly wed,

37
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,839
and yet you can bear...

38
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
to deceive your wife.

39
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,360
The deal is done.

40
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,200
I hope you will not bother me again.

41
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,400
Why is Master Xiao in such a hurry?

42
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,640
To show my gratitude,

43
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,360
I have specially prepared...

44
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
a surprise for you.

45
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Lu Zhao.

46
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,000
Why are you here?

47
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,440
Naturally, to conspire with me...

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,240
in a grand design.

49
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,399
I will not believe...

50
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
a single word he says.

51
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
I know.

52
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,280
There must be something
you cannot tell me.

53
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,400
As long as you tell me the truth,

54
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
even if it is a tiger's den,

55
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,800
I will fight my way out with you.

56
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Lu Zhao.

57
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Listen to me.

58
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,880
I will explain it to you
when we get back.

59
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,680
We have to get out of here now.

60
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,640
The show has not even begun yet.

61
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,679
How can...

62
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
the main characters leave early?

63
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Watch out!

64
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,719
Situ Xing Yuan.

65
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,760
You are going back on your word!

66
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,280
I never promised...

67
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
to let you get away unscathed.

68
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Xiao Ren.

69
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
At a time like this,

70
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,360
you still refuse
to tell me what happened.

71
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,440
I am afraid he does not have
the courage to tell you the truth.

72
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,800
Then perhaps
I should speak in his stead.

73
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Shut up!

74
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
Xiao Ren.

75
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Lu Zhao.

76
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Look at me.

77
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I...

78
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
I am...

79
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,240
the son of Song Lou.

80
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
What did you say?

81
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,280
Before we got married,

82
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
were you in a daze...

83
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,280
because of this?

84
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Yes.

85
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,479
So,

86
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,960
you knew
about your true identity all along,

87
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
but you deliberately hid it...

88
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
to trick me into marrying you.

89
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Yes.

90
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,440
You compromised
with Situ Xing Yuan...

91
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,640
and tricked me
into drawing the defense map.

92
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I am sorry.

93
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Why?

94
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Lu Zhao.

95
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,240
I want to be with you.

96
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,520
Lu Zhao,
I want to be with you forever.

97
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,640
I want to grow old with you.

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,520
You coward.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
You betrayed me in the name of love.

100
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,880
You colluded
with the one who killed me.

101
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,440
You do not deserve to be my husband!

102
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,560
Lu Zhao.

103
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you really...

104
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,119
want to kill me?

105
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Yes!

106
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
As the Xuntian Sect leader,

107
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,800
you secretly conspired
with the wicked.

108
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,760
That is treachery.

109
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,000
You aided evil,

110
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,640
disregarding the people's lives.

111
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,520
That is inhumanity.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,560
My father raised you to adulthood.

113
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,040
His true heart...

114
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
was fed to a wolf.

115
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,280
That is unfilial.

116
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,640
You and I swore...

117
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,320
never to betray
each other in this life.

118
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,280
Yet you broke your vow.

119
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,920
That is...

120
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,840
unfaithfulness.

121
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Do you really...

122
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,160
hate me that much?

123
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
We...

124
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
are...

125
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
mortal...

126
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
enemies.

127
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Your Highness.

128
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,000
It is time.

129
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,680
It is your turn to take charge.

130
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Lu Zhao.

131
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,240
I was right about you.

132
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,280
I knew you would not disappoint me.

133
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,360
Situ Xing Yuan.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,120
You heartless beast!

135
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,400
I will kill you sooner or later!

136
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,560
Be patient.

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,720
The days ahead are long.

138
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,680
When I return victoriously,

139
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,159
I will have...

140
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,520
a heart-to-heart talk with you.

141
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Stop!

142
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Situ Xing Yuan!

143
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Do you dare...

144
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
fight me to the death today?

145
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Stop!

146
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,720
Stop! Situ Xing Yuan!

147
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,479
Stop right there, you animal!

148
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
You animal!

149
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,600
Get up now.

150
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,879
Come on, tomorrow is the wedding.

151
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,120
We still have a lot to prepare.

152
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
I know.

153
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,640
You have been busy lately.

154
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
If it is because...

155
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,240
of the vow you made
to Father when you were young,

156
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,280
you do not have to blame yourself.

157
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,520
You did not go
against Father's wish.

158
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,480
You have done
a great job protecting...

159
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,240
the Xuntian Sect and me.

160
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,960
Did we not agree?

161
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,640
We will not be siblings anymore.

162
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
Since we are husband and wife,

163
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,520
come hell...

164
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,960
or high water,

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,760
we shall face it together.

166
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,880
If you have something
to say, say it.

167
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,680
I am here with you.

168
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,320
I am the son...

169
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,120
of the traitor Song Lou.

170
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
I am the son...

171
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,680
of Southern Qing's traitor,

172
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,040
the Xiao family's sworn enemy,

173
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Song Lou's...

174
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,640
only legitimate son.

175
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,160
(Song Family Genealogy)

176
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,040
Since you knew about it long ago,

177
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,080
why are you only telling me now?

178
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,640
Because I cannot bear to let you go.
