1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,480
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,560
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Don't come near me.

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,840
It wasn't me.

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,760
I didn't do anything.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,240
I didn't do anything.

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,080
Who's there?

8
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,040
Who's there?

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
Who?

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,440
Who's there?

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Who is it?

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,440
I didn't do anything.

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,680
It really wasn't me.

14
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
A ghost!

15
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
A ghost!

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A ghost!

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,960
The game has already begun.

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,040
You all need to be smart.

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
If you're too stupid,

20
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,480
you might die.

21
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
She's so timid.

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Your Highness!

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,960
Your Highness!

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Lu Zhao...

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,200
Lu Zhao has become an evil spirit!

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,280
She has come back to take our lives!

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,119
Your Highness must believe me!

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm not lying to you!

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,519
She's going to kill all of us!

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
We'll all die!

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Xue Er!

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Your Highness.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,880
Please save me, Your Highness!

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Let's leave.

35
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,536
Let's forget about the Lu family's assets.

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Let's leave now!

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
- Let's leave now! - Liu Ying Xue!

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Calm down.

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,880
Whether she truly lost her memory...

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,480
or is faking it,

41
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
this is our best chance to seize the Lu family's assets.

42
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
The Lu family of Jiangnan...

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,800
is richer than the entire nation.

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,000
That's billions of silver taels!

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,640
Once our great plan succeeds,

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,800
the hardships you are enduring now...

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,120
will not be in vain.

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
I promise you.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
What do you say?

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,040
But I'm really not just throwing a tantrum this time.

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,800
Your Highness must believe me.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,959
After Lu Zhao woke up this time,

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,720
she was like a different person.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,320
She knows martial arts now.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,400
She even killed Du Juan.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
She used to be a weak woman.

57
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:32,720
How could she be so good at killing people now?

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,520
There must be something fishy.

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Your Highness,

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,360
you must be careful of her.

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480
She knows martial arts?

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
If that's the case,

63
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,280
let's go to the Liu manor tomorrow.

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,240
I'll find an assassin...

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,960
to test her.

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,960
(Xuntian Sect)

67
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Stop.

68
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:08,960
I don't want to fight anymore.

69
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Chief.

70
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,400
Has there been progress...

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
with Master?

72
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,600
That Princess of Chu, Lu Zhao,

73
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,440
fell to her death just as I was performing the ritual.

74
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,920
Then, she mysteriously came back to life.

75
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Before my sister died,

76
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,281
she gave her a jade pendant.

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
She promised to help her.

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
They had known each other long before.

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
Most importantly,

80
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,640
- on her body... - Her body?

81
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Where on her body?

82
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,760
You looked at her body?

83
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Anyway, I'm sure...

84
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
that Lu Zhao is my sister.

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,920
When are we going to bring Master back then?

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,120
She doesn't remember anything now.

87
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Tell her then.

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
With her intelligence,

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
would she be afraid of ghosts and spirits?

90
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,920
Besides, to save her,

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
you sacrificed...

92
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Ling Su.

93
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,240
I'm not as selfless as you think.

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,720
Everything I've done...

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,760
was just for my own sake.

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,200
Isn't it even better that she doesn't remember anything?

97
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,280
From now on,

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,280
we're not siblings anymore.

99
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,240
You're crazy.

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm not crazy.

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
From now on,

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,600
our identities won't get between us.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,279
She won't have any reason...

104
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,840
to push me away anymore.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,160
Why can't two people who love each other be together?

106
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,480
I won't give in.

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,320
Let me try one last time.

108
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,960
One last time.

109
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,760
(Liu Manor)

110
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Lu Zhao.

111
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
This...

112
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,840
This is...?

113
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Lu Zhao.

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
Do you really not remember?

115
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,760
Please don't blame me.

116
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,880
After the accident,

117
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
other than my husband,

118
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
I don't remember...

119
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
anyone else.

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
It's fine.

121
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
This time,

122
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,440
I brought you home...

123
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,360
so you can try some familiar dishes.

124
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Then, perhaps...

125
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,680
you'll remember something.

126
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,880
This is your father.

127
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,480
This is your aunt.

128
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,919
And this is your cousin,

129
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Liu Ying Xue.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
So you're my father...

131
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
and my aunt.

132
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Yes.

133
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,959
The two of you...

134
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,280
were sitting so close.

135
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,040
I thought...

136
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,320
you were a married couple.

137
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
It's just that...

138
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,600
my surname is Lu,

139
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,080
but Father's surname is Liu.

140
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Why is that?

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Lu Zhao.

142
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
It's like this.

143
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,080
Your mother's surname is Lu.

144
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Your father...

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,040
married into the Lu family.

146
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,080
That makes sense.

147
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
So Father married into the Lu family.

148
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
All right.

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Your Highness.

150
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:35,760
Let's serve the dishes first.

151
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,136
The dishes will get cold in this cold weather.

152
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Right.

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Quick.

154
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Have a seat.

155
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Hurry, serve the dishes.

156
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
- Hurry. - Be careful.

157
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,520
These are...

158
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,160
Eels are plump in the winter.

159
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,080
It's the best season to eat them.

160
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,960
Lu Zhao, when you were at home,

161
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,039
you loved the eel feasts...

162
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,600
made by our chef.

163
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,080
You're right, Father.

164
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,640
This is Stir-Fried Eel.

165
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,360
This is Stir-fried Eel with Scallions.

166
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,280
This is Oil-drizzled Shredded Eel.

167
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,560
And this is eel soup.

168
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,800
They're all Jiangnan-style dishes.

169
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
I'm sure...

170
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,920
Lu Zhao will love them.

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
That's right, Lu Zhao.

172
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,040
Eels are rare.

173
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,440
You must eat more.

174
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,600
- Okay. - Here.

175
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Lu Zhao's birth mother committed suicide...

176
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:44,641
by jumping into the river.

177
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
When her body was fished out,

178
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
it was dismembered.

179
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,200
It was covered in eels.

180
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Since then,

181
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,479
whenever Lu Zhao saw eels,

182
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,799
she would feel nauseous and vomit.

183
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,080
It was a physiological reaction.

184
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,000
You can't fake that.

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,720
That makes things easier then.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What's the matter?

187
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Lu Zhao.

188
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,960
Don't you usually...

189
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,560
love eating eels the most?

190
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,480
I don't remember.

191
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Thank you, Your Highness,

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,600
for being so thoughtful.

193
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Here.

194
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,520
Try it while it's hot.

195
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Okay.

196
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,880
It's indeed delicious and rich.

197
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,920
How dare you, Liu family!

198
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,480
You're ruthless for riches!

199
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,240
I'll slaughter you all today!

200
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,000
- Be careful, my dear! - Your Highness!

201
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Guards!

202
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Catch this criminal!

203
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,800
Lu Zhao!

204
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
Why did you take the blade for me?

205
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,760
As long as...

206
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
you're safe and sound...

207
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
I...

208
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,600
don't want anything else.

209
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Lu Zhao!

210
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
Lu Zhao!

211
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Lu Zhao!

212
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Summon the physician!

213
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,520
Summon the physician! Hurry!

214
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Your Highness!

215
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Your Highness!

216
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,560
Xue Er.

217
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Lu Zhao!

218
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Lu Zhao.

219
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,840
There's something...

220
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,240
you must listen to carefully.

221
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
This is not the time.

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,096
Staying alive is more important.

223
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Stay still.

224
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:46,480
Let me see your injury.

225
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
My dear.

226
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,520
I heard from the servants...

227
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,440
that my grandfather...

228
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,160
is the richest man in Jiangnan,

229
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,920
And I...

230
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
am the only heir of the Lu family.

231
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,040
If anything happens,

232
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,080
I don't want to see...

233
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,080
all the Lu family's assets...

234
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,680
go to other branches of the clan.

235
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
My dear,

236
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,800
what do you...

237
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,400
mean by that?

238
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Your Highness,

239
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,560
I've written a letter...

240
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,640
addressed to my clan elders in Jiangnan.

241
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
All the Lu family's assets shall be transferred...

242
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
to your manor.

243
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,400
You'll be in charge of it.

244
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
It's just that...

245
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,280
the elders of Jiangnan...

246
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,800
will only believe it...

247
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,400
if I confirm it myself.

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,120
When the time comes,

249
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
you can...

250
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,639
- Lu Zhao. - ...take this letter...

251
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Lu Zhao!

252
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,240
Your Highness, this is our physician.

253
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,080
Check her pulse. Hurry!

254
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,376
There are too many people here.

255
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,560
The turbid air is disturbing.

256
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,200
Please leave.

257
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,400
I'll do my best to treat Her Highness.

258
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,920
Do your best to treat her.

259
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
When she recovers,

260
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,520
I'll promote you to the head steward of my manor.

261
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,200
If anything happens to her,

262
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,520
I'll bury you with her!

263
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Yes, Your Highness.

264
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,279
I'm a spy from the Xuntian Sect.

265
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Greetings, Ms. Lu.

266
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,560
Are you injured?

267
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,200
It's just a pack of chicken blood.

268
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,520
Do you not trust...

269
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
your master's aim?

270
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,600
Do you trust me that much?

271
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
Situ Xian is already suspicious about your amnesia.

272
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
He hired an assassin...

273
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,080
to test you at the Liu family dinner.

274
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,880
Remember not to expose yourself.

275
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
If he wants to test me,

276
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,320
why don't I just play along with him...

277
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,440
so that he won't suspect me again?

278
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,480
I need an insider.

279
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,999
The female physician of the Liu manor...

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,520
has been my spy for years.

281
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,560
She can be of use to you.

282
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
That's perfect.

283
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Of course.

284
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,840
Someone who's part of the Xuntian Sect...

285
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,320
wouldn't be some petty criminal.

286
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Don't worry.

287
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,200
I will protect you no matter what.

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,040
That's enough, Xue Er.

289
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,760
What's the use of crying?

290
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,280
Mother.

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,640
There's really something wrong with her.

292
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,320
You have to believe me.

293
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,400
She's just pretending to have lost her memory.

294
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Go back first.

295
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Tomorrow,

296
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,840
I'll find a way to expose that wench.

297
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Your Highness.

298
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,560
How is the Princess's injury?

299
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,880
I just sent someone to ask.

300
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,696
She didn't injure any vital organs.

301
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,920
It's just a superficial wound.

302
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,880
She should recover by tomorrow morning.

303
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,520
She took the blade for me.

304
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I don't think...

305
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,400
she's faking it.

306
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,840
I heard from the female physician...

307
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
that if the assassin's sword was one inch off,

308
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,840
it would have pierced her heart.

309
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,560
Hurry up and take this letter to Jiangnan.

310
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,576
Bring the chief of the Lu clan...

311
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
to Ying.

312
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
During this time,

313
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Lu Zhao...

314
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,079
must not suffer any mishaps.

315
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Yes.

316
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,880
Does she really not remember anything?

317
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,520
Didn't you say you'd take me to His Highness?

318
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,480
Why did you bring me here?

319
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
His Highness is here.

320
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:31,280
You can go by yourself.

321
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Aunt.

322
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,040
What are you doing?

323
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Lu Zhao.

324
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,000
Come and take a look at who this is.

325
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Pull her up.

326
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,480
Nanny?

327
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,480
This old woman is a thief.

328
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,160
She stole from the manor.

329
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,640
Of course, she has to suffer.

330
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
Aunt.

331
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,160
This is the Prince of Chu's manor.

332
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,480
You shouldn't kill a servant like this.

333
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
I'm afraid it's inappropriate, Aunt.

334
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
So Your Highness remembers this old woman?

335
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,600
You want to save her life?

336
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
If Your Highness recognizes her,

337
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,360
then for Your Highness's sake,

338
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll spare her life.

339
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,200
But...

340
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,600
if Your Highness doesn't recognize her either,

341
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,640
then I'll drown her immediately...

342
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,600
as a warning to the others.

343
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,280
You can fool His Highness,

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,600
but you can't fool me.

345
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,360
If you don't admit to faking your memory loss...

346
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,000
and setting up this trap,

347
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,040
I'll kill this vile servant!

348
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,440
How dare you try to test me?
