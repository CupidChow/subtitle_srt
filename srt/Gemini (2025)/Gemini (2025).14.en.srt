1
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,160
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,280
(Episode 14)

3
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,520
Ling Su. Come and take a look.

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,400
How did Shao Yao bandage my wound?
It's oozing blood again.

5
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,520
Come here.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Chief.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,920
No wonder you can't get a girl.

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,840
At a time like this,
you have to scheme to gain sympathy.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,800
Here. I'll make your wound
a little bigger.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,400
I don't believe
she won't notice it then.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Are you crazy?

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,040
I just can't feel pain. I'll still
die if I lose too much blood.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,800
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,399
Besides, I've already sent someone
to tell Ms. Lu...

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,880
you're critically injured
and dying soon.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,680
When she gets here,
just start the performance.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,880
No. When did you tell her?

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Just now.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,960
She should be here soon.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,680
Are you crazy?

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Chief!

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,120
You can't die!

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Chief!

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,320
Chief!

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Does it hurt?

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Yes.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Chief!

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,960
You have to hang in there!

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Chief!

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,440
I thought you didn't feel pain.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,640
I have work to do
at the Xuntian Sect.

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
I have to go back and feed the dogs.

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
What?

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Ling Su, you...

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Get up now.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
I can't take it anymore.

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,160
I really didn't mean to.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,800
I just wanted you to visit me more.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,520
If you're really that angry,

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
then stab me.

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,959
But after you stab me,

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,080
this matter will all be over.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
You can't ignore me.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
You lied,

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
and you want to pay with your life.

46
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,600
Master is indeed generous.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
If I really die by your hand,

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,040
I'll have no regrets.

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Even if you can't feel pain,

50
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,960
you must protect yourself.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,080
If the wound is too big
and you lose too much blood,

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,400
you won't even know how you died.

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,280
How can you protect me
for the rest of my life?

54
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,360
Actually, this whole thing
was Ling Su's...

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
What did you just say?

56
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
I said...

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I like you.

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm willing to take a gamble on you.

59
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
I'm willing to risk my heart
one more time.

60
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
What's wrong?

61
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,720
I'd already planned it all out.

62
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I said...

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,680
I'd deal with Situ Xian first.

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,400
Then I'd buy you a big mansion.

65
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,840
Then I'd fill it with flowers.

66
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,080
Then I'd properly confess
my love to you.

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm not prepared for
what you've just said.

68
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,160
Turn around and let me see you.

69
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Look at me.

70
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
I know.

71
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
I know about everything you've done.

72
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,600
I've noticed it all.

73
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Thank you.

74
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,800
Let's be together from now on.

75
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Okay?

76
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Lu Zhao.

77
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
From now on,

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
I won't let you lose again.

79
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Okay.

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,920
Don't push me away.

81
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Lu Zhao.

82
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,160
After we deal with Situ Xian,

83
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,960
marry me.

84
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Okay?

85
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Okay.

86
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,800
- Hurry up.
- What are you doing?

87
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,199
- Hurry up!
- Ms. Lu may believe your lie,

88
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,160
but I don't. There's nothing wrong
with Master.

89
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
It wasn't a big deal before.

90
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,200
But I'm afraid he's truly
in danger now.

91
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm doomed.

92
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,960
I'm afraid I'm the one...

93
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
who's in danger this time.

94
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,320
You sure know
how to pick a good time!

95
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Are you doing it again?

96
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Well...

97
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Right.

98
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
How is the situation with Situ Xian?

99
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
He's too patient.

100
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,799
Since he got the Lu family's assets,

101
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,960
he hasn't stepped out
of his residence.

102
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,279
Those Qiang people seem to be doing
nothing out of the ordinary...

103
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,360
besides drinking tea and talking
business at the teahouse.

104
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Don't worry.

105
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
He's a fox.

106
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
He'll show his tail eventually.

107
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,320
We'll definitely expose him.

108
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
We definitely will.

109
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,079
- Your Highness.
- Speak.

110
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,440
I've investigated it.

111
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,680
Shao Yao is from the Xuntian Sect.

112
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,960
The guard you sent to Pilan Palace
to monitor Lu Zhao...

113
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,520
was also killed long ago.

114
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,000
The one who truly followed was...

115
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Xiao Ren.

116
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Xiao Ren.

117
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,920
Xuntian Sect.

118
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,680
You just wait and see!

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Your Highness.

120
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Speak!

121
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:02,879
Ms. Liu refuses to take
her medicine and go to sleep.

122
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,200
She's making a fuss and demanding
that you go and accompany her.

123
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,199
Did you not know that we are
discussing official matters...

124
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
right now?

125
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Tell her...

126
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,720
she shouldn't be arrogant
because I spoil her.

127
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Get out.

128
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Understood.

129
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Continue keeping an eye on Lu Zhao
and the Xuntian Sect.

130
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
I'll go check on her.

131
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
If anything happens,

132
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
report to me at any time.

133
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Understood.

134
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,680
I didn't expect you...

135
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
to know how to arrange flowers.

136
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Why is that surprising?

137
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,120
Women can wear armor.

138
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,480
Why can't men arrange flowers?

139
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,280
I enjoy these refined activities.

140
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
This is the first time I've heard...

141
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,920
you say,,,

142
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
what you like.

143
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,480
From now on, the flowers
in this manor...

144
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
are your responsibility.

145
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
I've received your orders.

146
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
After leaving
the Prince of Chu's manor,

147
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,520
the world feels vast.

148
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,600
The world is so big.

149
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,639
Why should women be forced...

150
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,360
to stay in a small courtyard...

151
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,600
for their entire lives?

152
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,880
You're right.

153
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,360
I believe that one day,

154
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
everyone in this world...

155
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,400
will be able to live freely.

156
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,439
- Candied haws!
- Do you want some candied haws?

157
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,759
Sweet and round candied haws!

158
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Shopkeeper!

159
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Two candied haws, please.

160
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Coming!

161
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Here.

162
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Let me.

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Sir.

164
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,600
This is the Ruyi Hairpin
that's in trend right now.

165
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,120
Wear it for everything to go well.

166
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,360
Quickly buy one for your wife!

167
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,880
- I'm not his...
- You're right.

168
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,800
My wife deserves a blessed life.

169
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,560
You are so good to your wife.

170
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,520
What a rare and blessed match!

171
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Only when both of us are blessed...

172
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,760
can we be together forever.

173
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
The shopkeeper is watching.

174
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,039
You two are truly a loving couple.

175
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
A match made in heaven!

176
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Well said!

177
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Here's a reward!

178
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,240
Thank you, sir! Thank you, ma'am!

179
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Where else would you like to go,
my wife?

180
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,240
Your husband
will accompany you to the end.

181
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
I want to eat...

182
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,200
the Xizi glutinous rice balls
from the east side of the city.

183
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Xizi glutinous rice balls?

184
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,160
Is the shopkeeper bald?

185
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Yes.

186
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:48,560
Wait for me here.
I'll be right back.

187
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Okay.

188
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Where are my seeds of longing?

189
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
No!

190
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Miss.

191
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
This is your bracelet, right?

192
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Thank you.

193
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Miss.

194
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
What's wrong?

195
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
I'm fine.

196
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,280
This girl is so strange.

197
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Miss!

198
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Miss!

199
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
She took poison?

200
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Miss.

201
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,440
Why did you try to kill yourself?

202
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,440
My husband sold me to a brothel.

203
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,480
Although I've escaped,

204
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,400
where can I go?

205
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,840
I'm no longer chaste.

206
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,720
I'm too ashamed to live.

207
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,680
If they catch me,

208
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,920
I'll die anyway.

209
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Please.

210
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,720
Put me out of my misery.

211
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,840
Why should women pay...

212
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,040
for men's sins?

213
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,640
It was never your fault.

214
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Where do you live?

215
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
I'll take you there.

216
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I'll see who dares to hurt you.

217
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,840
You must not risk yourself for me.

218
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
I'm not worth it.

219
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,560
No one should despise themselves.

220
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Come with me.

221
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Why are you back?

222
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,760
Who's going to make me money
if you come back?

223
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,960
I think you have a death wish!

224
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,160
Where did this wench come from?

225
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
You're interfering in our matters!

226
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,360
Don't come near us!

227
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Don't...

228
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,040
Don't you dare touch my savior!

229
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Savior?

230
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm going to kill you.
