(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,440
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,840
Have you ever regretted...

4
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,800
following me?

5
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,880
Never.

6
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Xue Er.

7
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,960
Xue Er.

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
Xue Er.

9
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,880
Xue Er, do not be afraid.

10
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,280
I will be with you soon.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Xue Er.

12
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,920
In the next life,

13
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
do not meet someone like me again.

14
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,760
(Xuntian Sect)

15
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,360
Chief.

16
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,360
Situ Xian escaped last night.

17
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Escaped?

18
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Where could he have gone?

19
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,439
He seems...

20
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,840
to have gone
towards the Song residence.

21
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,760
The residence
of the traitor Song Lou?

22
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Yes.

23
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,960
But no one has lived there for ages.

24
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
I do not know
what he is doing there.

25
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,000
He could not have
escaped on his own.

26
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
Someone must have helped him escape.

27
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,160
Could it be...

28
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,800
Situ Xing Yuan?

29
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
I was worried I could not catch him,

30
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,200
and he handed me
such a weakness himself.

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,160
Hey, you have not recovered yet.
I will go with you.

32
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
No need.

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Take care of Lu Zhao.

34
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Yes.

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,600
(Song Residence)

36
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,080
I have been waiting for you.

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,680
Situ Xing Yuan let you out, right?

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Where is he?

39
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Xiao Ren.

40
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,680
If it were not for you
and Xiao Jin Yu,

41
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
Xue Er would not have died!

42
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,000
If it were not for you and Lu Zhao,

43
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,199
I would have already ascended...

44
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,920
the supreme throne...

45
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,520
and commanded a realm
of thousands of miles.

46
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,640
You all ruined everything.

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Today,

48
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,520
I will put an end to this
once and for all.

49
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,440
Your good uncle is set on getting
the Imperial Palace Defense Map.

50
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,080
How could he let me die?

51
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,480
He must have already tampered
with your gunpowder.

52
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Situ Xian.

53
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
Think about...

54
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,280
every single incident
that has transpired in the past.

55
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,519
Who was it that orchestrated...

56
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,800
your marriage to Lu Zhao?

57
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,519
And who bewitched you...

58
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,599
to use the Lu family's wealth...

59
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,680
for illicit arms dealing
and collusion with the Qiang?

60
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,759
And now, for whose sake...

61
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
are you taking on these crimes?

62
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
And who...

63
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,720
used you as bait today...

64
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,240
just to lure me here?

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Situ Xian,

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,399
you have been a pawn all your life,

67
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
at the mercy of others.

68
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
Do not let him control you anymore.

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
Tell me where he is.

70
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
I will not kill you.

71
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,480
Using?

72
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,200
By telling me all this now,

73
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,800
are you not also using me?

74
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,520
I know.

75
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,000
I know everything.

76
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
All of you...

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,200
All of you are using me.

78
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,280
I, Situ Xian,

79
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,600
an imperial scion,

80
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
was dragged down
by my own birth mother.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
My whole life
was burdened by my origins,

82
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,480
trapped in a game of chess.

83
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,240
All who treated me sincerely...

84
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,680
were betrayed by me.

85
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,160
And now,

86
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,440
I am ensnared in the cocoon I spun,

87
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,280
foolish beyond measure.

88
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,720
I am coming to find you.

89
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,160
(Song)

90
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Master Xiao.

91
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,439
Look at the Song family crest.

92
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,200
Does it not resemble
the symbol on the jade pendant?

93
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,480
Situ Xing Yuan.

94
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,680
You dare come to see me alone?

95
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Master Xiao,

96
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,680
you have been a part
of the Xiao family for so long.

97
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
Do you not want to know...

98
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,720
who your biological parents are?

99
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
I...

100
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,240
just want to tell you...

101
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,640
who you really are.

102
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
(Song Family Genealogy)

103
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,040
Back then,
Song Lou committed treason,

104
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,400
causing my younger sister
to die tragically in Northern Qiang.

105
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,320
The Emperor sentenced
his entire family to be executed.

106
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
The entire Song family,

107
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:51,760
to preserve their dignity,

108
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
hanged themselves...

109
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,360
the night before the execution.

110
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,560
When I arrived,

111
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,400
only the child
in Lady Song's womb...

112
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,880
and the heirloom jade pendant...

113
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,240
had vanished.

114
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,120
That is to say,

115
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,320
you are a descendant
of the Song family.

116
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,760
Do you think...

117
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
a fake genealogy book...

118
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:20,480
can fool me?

119
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,240
The Song Lou case caused a stir.

120
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,919
His Majesty was furious.

121
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,040
The Three Judicial Offices
held a joint trial.

122
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,880
A genealogy book can be forged,

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
but the official case files...

124
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
could never be falsified.

125
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
If you kill me,

126
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Jin Lin will immediately...

127
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:38,440
expose your background.

128
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
Do you dare to bet with me?

129
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,280
Xiao Ren,

130
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,440
you dare not kill me.

131
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,640
Because you are afraid.

132
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,520
You know the Song family and
the Xiao family are blood enemies.

133
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,520
You are afraid
that if your background is exposed,

134
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,280
Xiao Jin Yu
will hate you to the bone,

135
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
crush your bones,
and scatter your ashes.

136
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,880
All that you desire in life...

137
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,760
will turn to dust.

138
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,440
As for growing old together
in harmony,

139
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,400
that is just a pipe dream.

140
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,160
I was born and raised
in the Xiao family.

141
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,719
The blood flowing in my veins...

142
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,400
is that of the Xiao family.

143
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
I am not a Song!

144
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Look closely.

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,480
You are a Song.

146
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,400
The blood of the Song family
runs in your veins.

147
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,200
Once His Majesty learns of this,

148
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,000
the entire Xiao family
will be implicated.

149
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,279
This is...

150
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,480
a dead end.

151
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,960
What exactly do you want?

152
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,880
Give me
the Imperial Palace Defense Map.

153
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,360
I will keep your true identity
a secret forever.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,440
You want me to commit treason?

155
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Ninth Prince,

156
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
you are wrong.

157
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,640
I have another solution.

158
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Have you forgotten?

159
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,800
I am a Xiao.

160
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,120
We, the Xiao family, would...

161
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
rather...

162
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,520
die...

163
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
than...

164
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
betray.

165
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,840
Betray the country?

166
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,720
No.

167
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,480
My sister was tortured to death
by the Qiang people.

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I have a blood feud with the Qiang.

169
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
I would never commit treason
for glory.

170
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,559
If I ascend the throne,

171
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,480
I will never allow Southern Qing
to be humiliated.

172
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,040
I will fight with the Qiang kingdom
to the bitter end.

173
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,040
In fact, I have already made
all the necessary preparations.

174
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,600
I can purge the palace with blood
and ascend the throne at any time.

175
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,760
The reason I want
the Imperial Palace Defense Map...

176
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
is simply to avoid
harming innocent lives.

177
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,520
What have the palace guards
done wrong?

178
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,360
What have the people
of the capital done wrong?

179
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
A foolish emperor sits
on the throne.

180
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,920
Your identity exposed.

181
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
Innocent people slain.

182
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,760
Is this the outcome you want?

183
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,560
I promise you,

184
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,000
I will never slaughter the innocent.

185
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,960
And I will treat
the former emperor well,

186
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,360
allowing him to live out his days
as the Taishang Huang.

187
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,999
I will also...

188
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
personally issue a decree...

189
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
to bestow marriage
upon you and Lu Zhao.

190
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,360
This collaboration...

191
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
will benefit you,
me,

192
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,160
and the people of the world.

193
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,160
It brings only benefits,
without a single harm.

194
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,720
I will give you time to consider.

195
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
You are a smart person.

196
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,240
You know how to choose.

197
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,840
Situ Xian...

198
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,960
is my token of sincerity to you.

199
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,240
I hope you will show
your sincerity as well.

200
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,000
Do not disappoint me.

202
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,720
(Song Lou Treason Case)

203
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
In the ninth year of Shuntai,

204
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,960
Song Lou committed treason.

205
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,440
His family was executed
and nearly wiped out.

206
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,720
However,
the Song family's newborn heir...

207
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,400
and the Song family heirloom jade...

208
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,120
were secretly sent away
by Lady Song...

209
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,360
and disappeared without a trace.

210
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,800
(Song)

211
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,480
How utterly ridiculous.
