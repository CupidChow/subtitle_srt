1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
(Gemini)

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
(Episode 28)

3
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
I'll play this one.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then I'll play this one.

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
I won.

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,440
I lost again.

7
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,656
Lu Zhao lost and I took the punishment for her.

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,440
That's because she's my wife.

9
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Shao Yao lost.
Who are you to take her punishment?

10
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,576
That's right. Who are you to do that?

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
Because...

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,800
Because...

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
Who are you to do that?

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,720
Can't you see why?

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Ling Su.

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
You...

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,040
You brat!

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Ling Su.

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Look.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,440
Let's play with this.

21
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,920
Let's make a wish together.

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,400
Okay. Then let's wish...

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,919
that we get everything we wish for.

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,440
And that we have ample time ahead!

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
- Happy New Year's Eve! - Happy New Year!

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,520
Peace and prosperity!

27
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
We'll have ample time ahead.

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Plenty of time.

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,480
- What's your name? - Xiao Ren.

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
"Xiao" as in Xiao Jin Yu.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,720
"Ren," the word for blade.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,040
I like women who are wise and brave in this world.

33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,480
Apart from my sister,

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,439
Ms. Lu is considered...

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,560
the best in the world.

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Lu Zhao, you like me?

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,960
If there's anywhere you want to go,

38
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,960
or anything you want to do, just do it boldly.

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Xiao Ren.

40
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
If it weren't for you,

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,720
I wouldn't dare to think...

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,160
when I'd be able to step right back under the sun.

43
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Lu Zhao.

44
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,359
I'll take you home.

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Xiao Ren.

46
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
From now on,

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,680
there will be no more...

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,080
barriers between us.

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
Were you thinking about Father just now?

50
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,240
I just received a confidential letter.

51
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,480
Our spies have gotten in touch with him.

52
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
But he's in a high position.

53
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,040
I'm afraid he can't make it out so easily.

54
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,079
One day,

55
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,200
we'll be reunited.

56
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
By the way,

57
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,679
Shao Yao said...

58
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,719
that your body...

59
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,200
has fully recovered.

60
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,000
That's all thanks to my virtuous wife.

61
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,000
She takes such good care of me every day.

62
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,599
Then I ask that my husband...

63
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,799
takes good care of himself.

64
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Don't make your wife worry anymore.

65
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Of course.

66
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
However,

67
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,240
since you've taken such good care of me,

68
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,480
give me a chance to repay you.

69
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
What are you doing?

70
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
What are you doing?

71
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
Put me down.

72
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,560
You've just recovered.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,199
All the more reason to have fun while we can.

74
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
Put me down.

75
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
My dear, stop it.

76
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
I want to sleep more.

77
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Stop sleeping.

78
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Wake up.

79
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
Master! Bad news!

80
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Something happened!

81
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Go.

82
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Hurry.

83
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Go on.

84
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Master.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,296
Master, this confidential letter was delivered this morning.

86
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,160
It concerns Master Song. I dared not delay it.

87
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
I've brought it over right away.

88
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,280
What's wrong? What happened?

89
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,600
A coup d'état in Northern Qiang.

90
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,680
To cover up for the spies we left behind,

91
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,200
Father is now imprisoned.

92
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,240
Lu Zhao, I have to save him.

93
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
I'll go with you.

94
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,160
Xiao Ren, rescuing Song Lou...

95
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,600
won't be an easy feat.

96
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Your lives will be at stake.

97
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,720
Are you sure about this?

98
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
I've made up my mind.

99
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
I'll risk my life for this.

100
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,080
I hope Your Majesty will allow me.

101
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,040
In the 29th year of the Shuntai reign,

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,200
Prince of Huai, Situ Xing Yuan, seized the throne.

103
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,200
Xuntian Sect Master, Xiao Ren protected the Emperor with his life.

104
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,480
He died from severe injuries.

105
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
His wife, Lu Zhao, committed suicide.

106
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,560
The Emperor, overcome with grief,

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,520
decreed a grand burial.

108
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Just see me off here.

109
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
I have a secret mission ahead.

110
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,800
I can no longer walk the world with my true identity.

111
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,880
From now on,

112
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,840
Xuntian Sect will be entrusted to you.

113
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,080
Yes, I'll safeguard your badge...

114
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,400
and await your return.

115
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Once you leave,

116
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,720
I don't know when we'll meet again.

117
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,839
Once we've rescued him,

118
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,160
we'll return as soon as possible.

119
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,560
You must take good care.

120
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Don't worry.

121
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,840
I'll keep her safe.

122
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,280
Let me take you somewhere.

123
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,616
Young Master, Madam is waiting for you in the main hall.

124
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
Go quickly. I'll get back to work.

125
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,319
Uncle, please don't tell my mother...

126
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,400
that I'm out playing.

127
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Otherwise, she'll spank me.

128
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Let's go!

129
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
Mine is for the Second Madam.

130
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,200
She just found out she's pregnant. This is perfect for her.

131
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Xiao Ren.

132
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,680
Your uncle insists on getting drunk with you today.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm going to buy your favorite dogwood wine now.

134
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Wait for me.

135
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,599
- I won! - So what if you're strong?

136
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,736
I dare you to compete in the Spring Imperial Exam next year?

137
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Why wouldn't I dare?

138
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
The top scholar will be me.

139
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,080
I will bring glory to the entire Song family.

140
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Xiao Ren,

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
you're back.

142
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Come here quickly.

143
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
What's wrong?

144
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Nothing.

145
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,760
I remember Situ Xian blew this place up.

146
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,960
While you were unconscious,

147
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,640
I had someone renovate this mansion.

148
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
But General Song hasn't returned yet.

149
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Fearing suspicion,

150
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
I didn't dare to attract too much attention.

151
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,360
When we bring Father back,

152
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,040
the Song family's name will then be cleared.

153
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Thank you.

154
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Let's head out.

155
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Let's go.

156
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,120
Let's bring Father home now.

157
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,960
Ancestors, rest assured.

158
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,920
Lu Zhao and I will surely bring Father back.

159
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,519
Are you ready?

160
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Of course.

161
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
(Rescue Song Lou)

162
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
(Thanks for watching.)

163
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
(Behind the scenes!)

164
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,999
Get ready. A bit more.

165
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,840
One, two, three, go.

166
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
- I can't hold any longer. - Okay.

167
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:34,000
Situ Xing Yuan, do you dare...

168
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Finish your line!

169
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,400
- This is a real girlfriend. - Okay...

170
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,359
Flames are ablaze in your eyes.

171
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,359
Then prance.

172
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,320
How should I handle this scene?

173
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,440
Look at me...

174
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
What are you doing?

175
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,320
- All right, go on. - Okay, get ready.

176
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Let's have a baby.

177
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,880
Your master is...

178
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,720
You should lose some weight.

179
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,079
Olt's time to do some training.

180
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,719
Then here he comes.

181
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,679
Who is your master?

182
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,920
Be careful.

183
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,239
Can you get into the mood?

184
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
You even whined.

185
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,999
You have to start somewhere.

186
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,919
- Choose a pivot point. - If we take this whole part...

187
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,000
- Isn't this a but messy? - This part is...

188
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Change this part.

189
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
(The crew remains dutiful till the end)

190
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,479
This part doesn't affect it.

191
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,319
(They stay at their posts all day and night)

192
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,999
Found it.

193
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,160
Okay, go.

194
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Walk faster.

195
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Another take.

196
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,720
Be careful not to hurt the legs.

197
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
- Blood and... - Again, do it again.

198
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,119
Slow down, it's too much.

199
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,919
You assisted the evil deeds.

200
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,759
You put the people's lives...

201
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
(Saying out the lyrics and doing the actions repeatedly)
Putting the people's lives at risk.

202
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:06,840
Why would you slide off? I already saved two spaces.

203
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,239
(Getting into character again and again)

204
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Again.

205
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,079
Okay, again.

206
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,120
Keep the emotions flowing.

207
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,159
Cut. Again.

208
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,200
A bit more. Again.

209
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
(Long nights)
On the bridge...

210
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:25,319
(The hearts of the artists remain awake)

211
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,919
Okay, push.

212
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,680
(From night to dawn)

213
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,480
(It's like a long expedition for passion)

214
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,160
Get this down. Go.

215
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,999
- All right. - So this is about it.

216
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Should we do this?

217
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,999
That's too much. This is okay.

218
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's rehearse it.

219
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,080
Why? Who are you to do this?

220
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,999
(They have to be the best answers)

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,359
I'll kill you sooner or later!

222
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,639
Stop right there! Stop, Situ Xing Yuan!

223
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Okay, good.

224
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,040
So much for being clever.

225
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,920
But that's just a page.

226
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,200
What? You can't fool me. I won't fall for it.

227
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,199
As Xuntian Sect's Master,

228
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,639
yet you colluded with villains.

229
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,639
Do you really think praying to the gods...

230
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,520
will ensure a safe childbirth?

231
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,600
Gemini...

232
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,159
It's a wrap.

233
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,520
And great ratings!

234
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,999
I'll be the next male lead.

235
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I hope all your wishes comes true and be happy.

236
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
I'm clocking out!

237
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,079
Goodbye, Gemini!

238
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
(Thanks for your hard work)

239
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:17,560
It's a wrap, Gemini! Here's to great ratings!

240
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
(The End)
