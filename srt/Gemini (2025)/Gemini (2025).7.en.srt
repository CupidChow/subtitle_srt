1
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,240
(Gemini)

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,560
(Episode 7)

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,840
You may have fooled His Highness,

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
but you can't fool me.

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Today,

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,000
if you refuse to admit you're pretending...

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,360
to have amnesia,

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,640
I'll kill this servant.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,840
How dare you test me?

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Lu Zhao!

11
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:00,016
How dare you start a fight here?

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,080
Why wouldn't I?

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,359
I only wanted to take my time playing this little game...

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,160
of cat and mouse with you.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,360
But I've changed my mind.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Aunt.

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,440
Go to hell.

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
She's...

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,080
She's dead?

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
Lu Zhao.

21
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:54,936
Hhow will you explain this to them?

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,119
Nanny, don't be afraid.

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
I know what to do.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
I'll get you out of here.

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Your Highness.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
You're going on a killing spree here in the manor.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
What are you going to do...

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
about the bodies?

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,080
I know what to do.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
I know you do.

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,559
If we join forces,

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,240
we can achieve our goal without bloodshed.

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Isn't that better?

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
The Xuntian Sect...

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
There's an assassination at King of Chu's manor.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,160
The Xuntian Sect then takes the chance to investigate the manor.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,480
Is this what you mean...

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,080
by "joining forces"?

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Don't worry.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,800
I'll take care of the aftermath.

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I won't let you lose.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Hurry, Your Highness!

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Come with me!

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Xue Er.

45
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
We're at the manor.

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Mind your behavior.

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Your Highness.

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Just come with me.

49
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,000
Mother!

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,360
Mother!

51
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
Aunt?

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,000
What happened to Aunt?

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,920
She died in the back garden...

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,040
an hour ago.

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
What happened?

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Aunt.

57
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Aunt!

58
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
You wench!

59
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,880
You have the nerve to ask that.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,400
How dare you?

61
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Enough!

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Ying Xue.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,040
Your mother passed away.

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,840
Why are you hitting me over her death?

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,960
Mother told me...

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,320
she was meeting you in private today.

67
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,840
But now she's dead.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
It's you.

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
You killed my mother.

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
It's you!

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Ying Xue!

72
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,600
I understand your grief.

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,280
Aunt's sudden passing...

74
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,520
saddens me too.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,919
But Aunt was my family.

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,799
If she wanted to see me, she could have just said so.

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,720
Why would she want to meet in private?

78
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
-You... -That's enough.

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Lu Zhao.

80
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,400
I've already investigated...

81
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
everyone...

82
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
in the manor.

83
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Everyone has an alibi.

84
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,760
You're the only exception.

85
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Your Highness.

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,640
How can you suspect me?

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Not to mention,

88
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,200
I have no reason to harm Aunt.

89
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Furthermore,

90
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
I am but a woman.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,520
How could I do such a thing, Your Highness?

92
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,040
Of course, I wouldn't suspect you, my dear.

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
However,

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,720
where were you...

95
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
an hour ago?

96
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
Is there someone...

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
who can prove it?

98
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,400
Your Highness, I...

99
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Your Highness.

100
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,736
Xiao Ren, Master of the Xuntian Sect,

101
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,056
has forced his way into the manor with a sword.

102
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
What did you say?

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,320
I forced my way in, you say?

104
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,000
I heard there was a murder at King of Chu's manor.

105
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,800
I was too eager to help.

106
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,560
What a grand display!

107
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
What's this?

108
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,240
Barging into the manor?

109
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Xiao Ren.

110
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,280
Are you rebelling?

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,760
There's a murder in the Prince’s manor under the Emperor’s nose.

112
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,680
Can't the Xuntian Sect look into it?

113
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,280
But this is...

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,960
family business.

115
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,320
The royal family’s business...

116
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,520
is the nation’s business.

117
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,480
The murderer hasn't been caught yet.

118
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,576
The crisis in the manor hasn't been resolved.

119
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,040
No one is allowed to leave.

120
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,960
Seal off the manor.

121
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,200
Search every inch.

122
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Get a move on.

123
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Xiao Ren!

124
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Don't you dare.

125
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,399
Oversee all officials.

126
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Guard the royal family.

127
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,479
By imperial decree,

128
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,200
execute first, report later.

129
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,000
Those are the Xuntian Sect's duties. Why wouldn't I dare?

130
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
But Your Highness,

131
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
why are you so afraid we'd investigate?

132
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
Could it be...

133
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,119
you're afraid...

134
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll uncover some disgraceful secret in the manor?

135
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,679
We've looked into it.

136
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
She's the murderer!

137
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,839
My mother only met her before she died.

138
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
It must be her.

139
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
I didn't do it.

140
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
I didn't.

141
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
I didn't.

142
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
I didn't do it.

143
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
You are...

144
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,520
a suspect?

145
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
If that's the case,

146
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
why don't I...

147
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
take her with me,

148
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,480
and I'll interrogate her properly?

149
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Xiao Ren.

150
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,880
She is my wife.

151
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,600
How dare you touch her?

152
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,960
This is the Princess of Chu?

153
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
My apologies.

154
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,920
I just thought that...

155
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,416
this lady with the beautiful clothes...

156
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,480
was the Princess instead.

157
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,280
If I may be so bold,

158
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
who are you?

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,120
I am Her Highness' cousin.

160
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,160
You accused Her Highness of obstructing official duties.

161
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
Ling Su.

162
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Take her away.

163
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm not going!

164
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Your Highness!

165
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:58,880
Your Highness, save me!

166
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Report!

167
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,279
Madam Fang's bodyguards...

168
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
and housekeeper...

169
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
have been found.

170
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Bring them here.

171
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
They are all dead.

172
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,839
Judging by the knife wounds,

173
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,280
it was the work of the Xuntian Sect.

174
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,280
You wretched woman.

175
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,520
You will die with my mother!

176
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Watch your mouth.

177
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Your mother...

178
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,160
fell into the pond and drowned.

179
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,960
How dare you slander Her Highness?

180
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Your Highness!

181
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
A servant reported...

182
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,560
that Madam Fang had too much to drink,

183
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,480
and she fell into the water and drowned.

184
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,920
She is just a commoner.

185
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Master Xiao.

186
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,680
Are you going to...

187
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,760
seal off my manor...

188
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,960
and take away my wife because of this?

189
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,680
If word gets out,

190
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,560
aren't you afraid of gossip?

191
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,400
You're right, Your Highness.

192
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,839
Since this is their family matter,

193
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
it is not appropriate for the Xuntian Sect...

194
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:16,320
to get involved.

195
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
However,

196
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Your Highness,

197
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,961
you have committed too many evil deeds.

198
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
You should watch out for retribution.

199
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
I'll take my leave.

200
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
By the way,

201
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,200
there's no need to rush, Your Highness.

202
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm taking my time as well.

203
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,760
Let's play this game slowly.

204
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,280
Thank you for protecting me, Your Highness.

205
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Actually,

206
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:00,999
the truth will speak for itself.

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,240
I could've gone to the Xuntian Sect with them.

208
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,040
It's not as simple as you think.

209
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Jin Lin.

210
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:10,041
Take the Princess back to her room.

211
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Your Highness.

212
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Go.

213
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,120
Please come this way, Your Highness.

214
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Why?

215
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,640
Why do you treat me like this?

216
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,640
Why do you treat me like this?

217
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,440
It was my mother who died.

218
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,040
It was my mother.

219
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,840
Didn't I tell you...

220
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,880
not to cause any more trouble?

221
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,120
You colluded with your mother...

222
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,920
to make things difficult for Lu Zhao.

223
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,520
But you ended up attracting those Xuntian Sect mad dogs.

224
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,720
Fang Yuan Rou is nothing.

225
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,440
Lu Zhao killed her, you say?

226
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
What a joke.

227
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,200
The guards and women with her...

228
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,320
were all killed by the Xuntian Sect.

229
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,040
Do you know that?

230
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Xue Er.

231
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,080
The Xuntian Sect has been after me.

232
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,880
They killed your mother...

233
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,160
so that they can search my manor...

234
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,520
under the guise of an investigation.

235
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,440
If they succeed,

236
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
me,

237
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
you,

238
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,480
and over 300 lives in the manor...

239
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,640
will all go to hell...

240
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
with your stupid mother.

241
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Your Highness.

242
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,840
I was wrong.

243
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,200
I won't cause trouble again.

244
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

245
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
I'll be obedient from now on.

246
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

247
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,800
You're grounded from now on.

248
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,120
Without my permission,

249
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,840
you can't go anywhere.

250
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,920
Your Highness!

251
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Chief.

252
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,960
Why are you dressed so extravagantly?

253
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
You wouldn't understand.

254
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
You're here.

255
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

256
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,280
I've been watching Situ Xian.

257
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Did he believe it?

258
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Yes.

259
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,680
He buried the guards and the madam hastily.

260
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,760
This was to confirm they fell into the water and died.

261
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
What happened today...

262
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
was all thanks to you.

263
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Thank you.

264
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
We're allies.

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No need to thank me.

266
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,280
Then in the future,

267
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
what if...

268
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,440
I want to kill someone else?

269
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
In that case,

270
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
I will surely...

271
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,560
pass you a good knife.

272
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
What's this?

273
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,296
This is the roast goose from the imperial kitchen.

274
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,640
I just...

275
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
brought it with me.

276
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Try it.

277
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is it good?

278
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,400
If it's good, I'll grab some for you next time.

279
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,360
It's the middle of winter.

280
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,959
Freshly roasted goose...

281
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,240
gets cold quickly.

282
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,319
No matter how good the skill,

283
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,560
it's bound to taste fishy.

284
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,080
From the palace to Prince of Chu's manor,

285
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,176
even a fast horse needs an hour to travel the distance.

286
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,760
However, this roast goose is still hot.

287
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,880
How did you manage to "just bring it" with you?

288
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,079
You must have specially brought it here.

289
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,320
You rode fast on a swift horse,

290
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,360
and you used a charcoal stove to keep it warm.

291
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,080
The plate is still hot to touch.

292
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,000
Master Xiao, you sure are attentive.

293
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,400
Could it be...

294
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,360
that you like me?

295
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,600
What if I say yes?

296
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
What will you do?
