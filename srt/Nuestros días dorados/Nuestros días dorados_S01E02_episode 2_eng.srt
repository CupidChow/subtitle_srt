1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,010
 I found her. 

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,180
You found her?

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,030
Are you sure?

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,400
Send me a photo first.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,470
And send the address and occupation.

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,850
I'll hear about the rest when we meet.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,010
It's not something to talk about over the phone.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,470
Bring confirmed documents,
statements, and audio recordings.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,050
I'll send you where and when to meet.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,050
 

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,010
I told you to text instead of calling.

12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,300
Stay there.

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,850
Is it uncomfortable? What is?

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,370
Do you need something?

15
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,570
Don't you have food and clothes? How about AC?

16
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,970
Don't you know why you should be hiding?

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
 

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,540
Ji Wan can use my room when I move out.

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,910
It'd be nice to rent out the
side unit like we used to.

20
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,330
Why would you worry about that? Huh?

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,680
I'm still able to make money.

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,560
Ji Hyeok, if you meet someone you like later,

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,350
you'd want to get married.

24
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,900
I know. That's what I'm saying.

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,650
Why bother getting your own place?

26
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,300
You'll be losing money the moment you move out.

27
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,820
And you've been too invested in your hobbies.

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,460
Father, Mother,

29
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,970
I really have no interest in getting married.

30
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,760
Why? Are you one of those people?

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,630
I heard young people these days

32
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,550
give up on everything because
it's tough, including marriage.

33
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,370
It's not giving up. It can be a matter of choice.

34
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,350
My generation is like that.

35
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,280
What kind of choice is that?
It's giving up in advance.

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,950
You think we got married because
we were making a good living?

37
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,440
It's about the mindset. The mindset.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,180
You can do anything when you're young.

39
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,270
You're a man, but you can't even
support a woman you love?

40
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,380
You just need to be able-bodied.

41
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,790
Yes, Father. That's what I'm saying.

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,660
And you try to move out recklessly,
saying you won't get married?

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,420
You can forget about saving money
the moment you move out.

44
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,780
If you meet a nice woman later,

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,730
you'll beat yourself up later.

46
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,350
You'll say, "Why did I do that?"

47
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,470
By chance, do you...

48
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,790
do you want to buy a house before you get married?

49
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,410
Hey, I took care of your sick grandfather

50
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,870
and raised the three of you.

51
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,960
Do you understand?

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,760
Yes.

53
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,950
I understand your position. Enjoy your meal.

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,720
Geez.

55
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,270
Hyung, will you really not get married?

56
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,980
Ji Hyeok, will you really not get married?

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,270
- I won't.
- Daebak.

58
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,550
He doesn't want to when I'm dying to.

59
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,000
Are you moving out, then?

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,700
I'm looking for a place.

61
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,350
Why were you just listening to them, then?
As if you'd do what they say.

62
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,420
I listened because they voiced their opinions.

63
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,520
I get it.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,350
Ji Hyeok, you'll move out
even if they're against it.

65
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,910
They won't approve, anyway.

66
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,600
Hyung, how could you do this?

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,110
You should've made yourself clear.
Why didn't you say anything?

68
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,780
I don't need approval to become independent at 33.

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,310
That's true.

70
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,700
It's impossible to make Mom, Dad,
and especially Grandma understand.

71
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,260
You should be independent
if you don't plan to get married.

72
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,230
But I really don't understand.

73
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,350
You have a good job, a good salary,

74
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,520
a nice body, a working father,
and you're always dating.

75
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,200
Why won't you marry, then?

76
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Why do you sound like Mom and Dad?

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,940
There are more people who aren't
getting married these days.

78
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,570
Hey, they want to, but they can't.

79
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,140
- Because they can't afford a house.
- Whatever.

80
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,410
Ji Hyeok, when will you move out, then?

81
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,500
Once I sign a contract.

82
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,160
So, don't butt in with my business.

83
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,280
I won't even if you told me to.

84
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,100
I hate getting involved in people's business.

85
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,800
I won't, either.

86
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,590
It's your life. Go for it if you've decided. Do it.

87
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,240
It'd be impossible to convince
Mom and Dad, anyway.

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,170
- Get going.
- Okay.

89
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,690
Bye.

90
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,100
Hyung, then,

91
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,620
I can get married first, right?

92
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,670
- Can you afford to?
- Of course.

93
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,850
I have a woman I love to death,
and a healthy body!

94
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,260
I can get married!

95
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,490
 Even tomorrow! 

96
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,690
I got scared when Ji Hyeok said he'll move out.

97
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,530
I thought he'd get married and move out.

98
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,840
I really don't understand the kids these days.

99
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,410
How could we understand them?

100
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,130
My mom didn't understand when I married you, too.

101
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,040
She kept saying, "Kids these days."

102
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,030
She raised me to become a teacher,
so I won't live like her.

103
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,710
But I wanted to get married first.

104
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,050
Right.

105
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,090
Our first home was
a semi-basement studio apartment.

106
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,900
But did I find it uncomfortable?

107
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,810
I was just happy. Because I could be with you.

108
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,140
We set a bucket under a leaking ceiling

109
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,890
and was entertained
by the sound of the water drop.

110
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,800
It was so funny.

111
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,580
I never thought Ji Hyeok would be this immature.

112
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,820
It's because he hasn't been in true love.

113
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,560
How do you know that?

114
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,230
I've never seen him going out all the time or

115
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,590
being glued to his phone.

116
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,430
He was totally different from Ji Wan and Su Bin.

117
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,030
Right.

118
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,500
A man would do anything it takes to live

119
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,580
with the woman he loves.

120
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,050
Was it just our generation?

121
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,730
People really don't get married,
according to the news these days.

122
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,870
Do they not love each other
enough to share hardships?

123
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,820
It's not love if all you want to do is
enjoy only good things together.

124
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,080
That means you think of love as business.

125
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,300
But I'm glad Ji Hyeok understood us.

126
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,120
He's capable of understanding.
He's just got some silly ideas.

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,450
 

128
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,030
You're a certified scuba and surfing instructor.

129
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,290
You must like water.

130
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,300
I like sports in general.

131
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,520
I enjoy doing triathlons, too.

132
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,310
You must have a large lung capacity, then.

133
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,650
Should we start, then?

134
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,710
Once you're done with this,

135
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,480
could you change the
light bulbs for the track light?

136
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,970
I want it a little less bright.

137
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,050
Okay.

138
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,140
- Thank you.
- Gosh, you're hanging the pendant light.

139
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,450
It's so pretty.

140
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,880
You came.

141
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,510
Manager Ji, you're that type,
according to people these days.

142
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,910
Tsundere.*
(Cold outside, but warm inside)

143
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,130
Tsundere?

144
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,210
You acted as if you wouldn't
tolerate my request at all

145
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,510
but you tried to grind the ceiling yourself.

146
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,270
I only got it started.

147
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,920
It's all thanks to the paint department chief.

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,590
That's not all.

149
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,520
She even increased the electricity
capacity by 1.5 times.

150
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,090
See? See? You're tsundere.

151
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,790
I'm so moved.

152
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,450
I'll fix the track light now.

153
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,810
- Okay. I'll be right there.
- Okay.

154
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,810
By the way, I was moved, too.

155
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,280
You paid the paint department
chief a generous bonus.

156
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,900
I have conscience, too.

157
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,390
Thank you so much.

158
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,730
I'm grateful for your acknowledgment.

159
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,900
Gosh.

160
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,850
Why are you back inside?

161
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,120
Why? Did something happen?

162
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,410
You were coughing and
didn't sleep well last night.

163
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,300
I didn't want you to drive.

164
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,500
- Let's drive together.
- Gosh, seriously.

165
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,200
I need to use my car because
I travel often for Yeong Ra's show.

166
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,440
Then, I'll send a car with Mr. Oh.
Tell him to drive you.

167
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,340
Here we go again.

168
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,860
Using the company car makes me look bad.

169
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,920
Why should your wife use the company's car?

170
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,960
I don't want you to be criticized.

171
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,770
You can be stubborn sometimes.

172
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,390
It's actually pretty fun to drive, Honey.

173
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,880
You made sure to schedule an appointment, right?

174
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,320
Okay.

175
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,580
Be on standby and let me know when you leave.

176
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,700
 

177
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,740
Secretary Go, it's me.

178
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,680
Let's call it a day.

179
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,000
Wait, Director Park.

180
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,340
Please look over this.

181
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,310
The first quarter sales went up a bit.

182
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,750
Yes, they went up by 11%.

183
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,580
How do you feel?

184
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,890
- Pardon?
- You must feel a certain way.

185
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,200
You might feel excited or disappointed
that you couldn't do more.

186
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,830
I did what I was supposed to do.

187
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,750
You're no fun at all.

188
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,790
I'll get going now.

189
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,310
 
 Why should I tell you if Ji Hyeok 

190
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,560
broke up with his girlfriend?

191
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,350
Come on now.

192
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,980
You already know.

193
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,420
That's a separate issue.

194
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,900
You've liked Ji Hyeok for a very long time.

195
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,280
But how could this...

196
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,690
benefit me in any way?

197
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,010
This isn't like you at all.

198
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,540
This isn't how Director Park is.

199
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,360
You misjudged me.

200
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,240
I'm a businessman who knows how to calculate.

201
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,100
Is this what they call give-and-take?

202
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,600
Okay, I'll do you a favor, too.

203
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,170
Okay, deal.

204
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,410
What favor do you want to ask?

205
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,130
I'll ask you...

206
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,100
when the time comes.

207
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,070
But...

208
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,700
you have to tell me this time.

209
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,050
Hello.

210
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,130
Eun Oh,

211
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,530
you need to take me to a movie.

212
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,170
A movie?

213
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,940
Well...

214
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,620
you asked me to let you know
when Ji Hyeok breaks up

215
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,590
with his girlfriend.

216
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,320
Did they break up?

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,090
Well, probably.

218
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,410
What do you mean, probably?

219
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,190
Ji Hyeok broke up.

220
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,880
- Really?
- I'm here.

221
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,720
Seong Jae, you were here.

222
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,790
I'll go to the restroom.

223
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,190
W-What brings you here?

224
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,360
I have a client meeting.

225
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,550
What brings you here at this hour?

226
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,790
I have a bit of a headache.

227
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,660
I was on a walk.

228
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,810
Iced Americano, right?

229
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,160
Wait just half an hour. It's a short meeting.

230
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,780
- Why? Do you want to have lunch with me?
- No.

231
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,380
I need to use you for something.

232
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,340
We'll eat afterward.

233
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,810
Okay.

234
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,930
- What's wrong, Eun Oh?
- Huh?

235
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,240
What brings you here, Ji Hyeok?

236
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,040
What?

237
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,990
Am I not allowed to ask you that?

238
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,570
You saw me just now.

239
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,210
Come here, Eun Oh.

240
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,160
W-Why?

241
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,340
You don't have a fever.

242
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,070
What are you doing?

243
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,780
Su Jeong, do we have Colombian beans left?

244
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,810
Gosh, I thought I had seen it all.

245
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,650
Right here. Come this way.

246
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,990
Yes, hello?

247
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,350
Yes, I'm Ji Eun Oh of Eunoh-ism.

248
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,180
You would like a quote?

249
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,510
Yes, I can help you.

250
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,710
Where are you located?

251
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,830
Although it's a bit pricey,

252
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,010
I recommend a hardwood floor.

253
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,540
Maroon black or blonde oak is nice.

254
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,390
Which color do you prefer?

255
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,320
I like the blonde...

256
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,470
 

257
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,470
Yes, I've decided.

258
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,550
- You have?
- Yes.

259
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,540
Italy, Spain, and France.

260
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,144
They're key European countries.

261
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,160
For how long?

262
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,240
We might as well make it a month.

263
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,250
When will I be able to go to Europe again?

264
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,640
Let's go, go, go.

265
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,890
Kim Da Jeong, maintain composure.

266
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,200
I won't. I won't. Composure?

267
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,930
Why should I care about that? I'm 58 now.

268
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,150
At 58, I'd be a little more
than halfway through 100.

269
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,520
I'm still young.

270
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,650
Gosh, you'll only look old then.

271
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,730
Right?

272
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,990
I was pretty bubbly and cute
before I got married in my 20s.

273
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,830
I was a good dancer, too.

274
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,100
Yes.

275
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,180
Europe is making you young.

276
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,770
Okay, good.

277
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,890
When should we go and turn back the clock?

278
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,480
As soon as possible.

279
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,140
When Su Bin gets back,
I'll have her call the agent.

280
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,170
She has backpacked through Europe.

281
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,500
As soon as possible?

282
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,110
 Manager Lee. 

283
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,070
 No, I should call you Advisor Lee now. 

284
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,900
 Let's grab dinner after the retirement ceremony. 

285
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,350
 You can start in about two months. 

286
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,640
What are you doing? Aren't you listening?

287
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,100
H-Hold on. I need to talk to Mr. Choi first.

288
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,230
I need to schedule a meeting before we leave.

289
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,890
Okay.

290
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,260
 Yes, this is CEO Choi's wife. 

291
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,900
P-Pardon?

292
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,240
Oh, Yes. This is Lee Sang Cheol.

293
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,600
I planned to meet with Mr. Choi.

294
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,810
 Yes, I know who you are. But... 

295
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,940
 my husband is at a hospital right now. 

296
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,180
Pardon? H-Hospital?

297
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,590
You'll let me sleep over once a month, right?

298
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,460
You must have a single bed.
Where would I sleep, then?

299
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,310
You'll sleep on the floor or on the sofa.

300
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,430
Sofa?

301
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,770
Oh, hey.

302
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,230
- I'll gift you a sofa.
- No.

303
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,110
A home theater. I have one in mind.

304
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,110
I can watch sports on the big screen loudly now.

305
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,830
Gosh, I'm jealous for some reason.

306
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,010
Get married. Then you can move-

307
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,490
Hey, you made a good point.
Don't try to read me. It's unlike you.

308
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,440
Sorry, I got too excited.

309
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,020
It's okay.

310
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,230
It's nice to see you smile for once.

311
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,780
Really? Let's go shopping then.

312
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,770
L-Late stage pancreatic cancer?

313
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,800
I talked to him early last week.

314
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,890
He passed out and came
to the hospital last weekend.

315
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,510
We didn't know until then.

316
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,130
But how...

317
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,760
How could this happen?

318
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,020
Gosh, t-thank you.

319
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,040
Former Manager Lee
from Gyengseong T and C, right?

320
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,980
My father told me about you.

321
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,110
Yes.

322
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,080
Mr. Choi told me a lot about you, too.

323
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,210
That you're working hard to learn the ropes.

324
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,920
I'm Director Choi Min Shik.

325
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,966
 

326
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,310
Oh, yes, yes.

327
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,990
D-Director Choi Min Shik.

328
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,650
I thought my father's condition
must make you feel anxious.

329
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,430
That's why I wanted to chat with you.

330
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,350
No. Mr. Choi's health comes first.

331
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,260
- After he gets surgery-
- He's not getting surgery.

332
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,320
It will be pointless at this point.

333
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,640
The doctor agrees with us, too.

334
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,600
So, we won't be able to keep the promise

335
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,920
my father made to you.

336
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,180
I know he wanted to hire you as an advisor.

337
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,800
But I'll become the CEO and...

338
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,570
I think differently.

339
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,690
Well...

340
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,470
I had accepted the offer for an advisor position

341
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,640
more than six months ago.

342
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,580
Did you have anyone else...

343
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,910
to work for six months ago besides us?

344
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,310
You were just lucky.

345
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,330
I don't believe we prevented you

346
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,850
from pursuing other options by hiring you.

347
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,470
Did you ask me to come in to introduce him to me?

348
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,780
I told you during the consultation
when you signed up last time.

349
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,110
That it's hard to meet a five-star man.

350
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,430
So, you want me to date an old man
who's 17 years older?

351
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,720
He's...

352
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,930
a bit older, but...

353
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,250
He looks like he's in
his mid- or late-30s in person.

354
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,770
Try meeting him.

355
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,940
The men with the qualifications you want

356
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,050
won't choose you. What can you do?

357
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,280
At least, we got this one man.

358
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,480
He wants someone pretty and
young more than anything.

359
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,050
That's why he wants to meet you.

360
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,310
He's a wealthy businessman.

361
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,860
He's rich.

362
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,040
I'll meet him for experience.

363
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,190
And I'll end up with 100,000 subscribers.

364
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,200
I don't just want...

365
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,660
a man with only money.

366
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,850
 If you just switch the purse, 

367
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,810
 you can look different. 

368
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,770
I'm young, pretty, educated,
and have independent parents.

369
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,650
She treats me like this
because I don't have a stable job?

370
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,300
Wait and see. I'll become a hit YouTuber.

371
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,220
How?

372
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,890
You stopped at 13,500 subscribers. How annoying.

373
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,110
What do you think the reason is?

374
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,720
I said you should just film in a swimsuit.

375
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,940
A lot of YouTubers do that.
They strip and dress casually.

376
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,950
It looks nice and natural.

377
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,910
No. I can't do stuff like that.

378
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,020
Don't you know already?

379
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,540
Okay.

380
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,950
Let's fix the money issue first.

381
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,900
In our joint account,

382
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,910
we have 153,000 won left.
But to upload the next video,

383
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,220
we need to buy clothes and
rent a studio space, too.

384
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,920
What do we do?

385
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,060
I'll ask Dad for help.

386
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,430
Should I give another private lesson?

387
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,660
I hate giving private lessons as is.

388
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,400
The next shoot is the issue.

389
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,000
Should we shoot outside instead of in a studio?

390
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,200
It's fine. It's okay.

391
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,460
There are other places besides Seongil Textile.

392
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,380
What a ridiculous and rude bastard.

393
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,370
He's nowhere near his father.

394
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,540
I didn't get any other offers,

395
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:52,010
but I could've been hired
in those six months, punk.

396
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,000
You're back.

397
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,500
Honey, we should buy clothes for the trip.

398
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,490
Especially you. You don't have casual clothes.

399
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,850
How's Mr. Choi?

400
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,290
What's his condition?

401
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,060
I-It's nothing.

402
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:26,110
By the way, how about we leave at the end of May?

403
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,590
It would start getting hot around then.

404
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,580
I-Is that so?

405
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,130
How strange. You wanted to leave early.

406
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,200
Maybe it's because I just retired.

407
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,570
I still feel unsettled.

408
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,870
That's not why.

409
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,580
Tell me the truth.

410
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,620
No, it's nothing. I said it's nothing.

411
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,620
You can't fool me.

412
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,840
Are you a mind reader? Come on, let go.

413
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,110
Did something happen to Mr. Choi?

414
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,470
That's it. What happened?

415
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,780
I said it's nothing...

416
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,480
Hold on.

417
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,800
 This is Director Choi from Seongil Textile. 

418
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,420
 I'm reaching out since I feel bad
about the sudden notice. 

419
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,410
 After discussing with my father, 

420
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,710
 I would like to compensate you
for this unfortunate situation. 

421
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,430
 Please send me your bank account number. 

422
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,790
T-This crazy bastard.

423
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,270
What's this bastard saying right now?

424
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,110
What's he talking about?

425
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,130
Well...

426
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,720
Mr. Choi has late-stage pancreatic cancer.

427
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,660
His son is taking over the company.

428
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,930
So, they are taking back the job offer. Happy?

429
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,710
He's not even 40. What did he say?

430
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,060
Compensate? Bank account number?

431
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,740
Who does he think I am?

432
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,710
Seriously.

433
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,000
He's ignoring me.

434
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,430
What should we do?

435
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,300
We should pay him to avoid issues later.

436
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,990
Sunbae,

437
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,040
I like you.

438
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,070
So, let's go out.

439
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,800
We'd make a pretty good couple.

440
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,980
What's she doing in that corner?

441
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,970
You must be surprised, but...

442
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,910
So, Sunbae...

443
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,310
Don't date other women.

444
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,400
- Go out with me.
- Hey!

445
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,880
You've lost your mind.

446
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,480
You said you won't seduce someone else's man.

447
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,250
No!

448
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,970
They apparently broke up.

449
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,470
So, are you rehearsing right now?

450
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:55,080
Gosh, why did you come out?

451
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,480
Geez, you left your phone inside.

452
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,460
I answered it because your mom kept calling.

453
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,970
Kkang Oh, right?

454
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,700
The office across the street
suddenly made a group reservation.

455
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,530
He wants you to come.

456
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,680
Really?

457
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,250
I'll ask if one of the guys wants a part-time job.

458
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,590
I already called Hae Na.

459
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,790
Thank you.

460
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,010
You are the best, Su Jeong.

461
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,850
I haven't gone there for over a month
because of the construction.

462
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,420
Thank you. Thank you.

463
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,980
Thank you.

464
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,050
I'll go. Thank you.

465
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,160
- Geez.
- Shit!

466
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,100
You're not even wearing an apron. Nice job.

467
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,340
It's your fault.

468
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,110
I wouldn't be doing this
if you didn't quit your job.

469
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,880
I spent my four-year salary to get you this shop.

470
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,010
So, you and Mom could make a living.

471
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,280
You think I should be
working at a place like this?

472
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,090
- You little...
- Don't.

473
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,950
- Don't. Don't!
- Of course.

474
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,340
Geez.

475
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,630
Put on an apron and help Mom.

476
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,690
I'm going easy on you because
I'm in a good mood today.

477
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,560
Why are you in a good mood?
You can't even make money.

478
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,930
How much do you make after
quitting that International company?

479
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,200
Do you make a 10th of it?

480
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,870
I don't make money because I started
my business only a year ago.

481
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,420
Gosh, you didn't have to come.

482
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,860
What did they order for the reservation?
What about the side dishes?

483
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,290
I already made most of them.

484
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,680
I'll go home after the group leaves
since Noona is here.

485
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,760
That little...

486
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,320
White kimchi?

487
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,150
- Should I get you more jeotgal?
- Thank you.

488
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,780
Kkang Oh, for table 2...

489
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,330
- You must be tired.
- Not at all.

490
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,970
You're so strong.

491
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,690
What time will Kkang Oh come home tonight?

492
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,240
Right, Mom. I got a quote request
for an apartment.

493
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,680
Really?

494
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,850
That's great.

495
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,670
Gosh. Look at this.

496
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,930
My goodness.

497
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,610
Geez.

498
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,980
She needs to sleep comfortably to recharge.

499
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,940
Let's see.

500
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,680
Oh, my gosh!

501
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,780
Ouch. Gosh, my head.

502
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,800
Gosh. What's this?

503
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,060
- Mom.
- Hey.

504
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,720
What did you do?

505
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,820
I was going to move you to the bed.

506
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,020
- Me?
- Yes.

507
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,480
- You're so funny.
- What in the world.

508
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,190
- Mom, you thought you could carry me?
- Yes.

509
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,460
You're so unbelievable.

510
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,980
Gosh, are you okay?

511
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,620
My gosh. I'm sorry.

512
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,350
Oh, no. Sorry, sorry. Gosh.

513
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,030
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

514
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,700
All done, right?

515
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,760
Email me the quote when you have it.

516
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,300
Okay, I will.

517
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,380
By the way,

518
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,400
you won't have enough storage
if you remove the veranda.

519
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,130
You can place small furniture
without expanding the kitchen.

520
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,080
I noticed that this wall
in the small room is not structural.

521
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,190
I guess the previous owner expanded it.

522
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,060
I'm just asking for a quote, not a consultation.

523
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,160
Yes, of course.

524
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,420
I'm just sharing information since I'm here.

525
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,850
Okay.

526
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,620
- Gosh.
- Diabetes...

527
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,030
I'm low in blood sugar. Please help.

528
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,460
Low in blood sugar?

529
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,160
Just one second.

530
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,780
Here's chocolate. Eat it.

531
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,020
Would you be able to stand up?

532
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,730
Are you feeling okay?

533
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,250
I'm okay.

534
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,120
Thank you.

535
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,670
Should you go to the hospital?

536
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,470
Or contact your family...

537
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,080
I took the chocolate medicine.

538
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,550
I carry that for emergencies, too.

539
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,430
And water, too.

540
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,710
If you're okay,

541
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,150
I'll get going now.

542
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,010
No, no. It's okay.

543
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,240
Hold on to me.

544
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,300
Thank you, young lady.

545
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,660
Don't mention it. Safe travels.

546
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,250
H-Hold on.

547
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,240
She gave me too much money.

548
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,405
 

549
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:44,420
 

550
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,020
I've sent you 3 million won.

551
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,820
- I got it.
- Okay, great.

552
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,410
You can send the balance
of 27 million won when you move in.

553
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,300
The rent is 1.2 million, right? All right...

554
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,470
- All done.
- Thank you.

555
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,170
Thank you.

556
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,540
 

557
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,270
 

558
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,640
 

559
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,320
Do it. Why can't you?

560
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,500
This is about work.

561
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,490
 

562
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,380
W-What are you doing here?

563
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,920
You told me to come.

564
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,950
When did I?

565
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,560
 

566
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,110
I was calling about signing off
on the volunteer work expenses.

567
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,570
I came just as you were about to say that, right?

568
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,610
Let's go inside to sign, then.

569
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,900
Let's eat first.

570
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm not hungry yet.

571
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,070
It's time to eat. There's no way you're not hungry.

572
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,770
- Let's go. I'm hungry.
- Wait, I need to tell Su Jeong.

573
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,510
How do you think I learned
you were coming to the cafe just now?

574
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,920
What are you doing? It's unlike you.

575
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,940
What do you mean?

576
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,720
Why did you order soup and rice separately?

577
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,960
Just do it as you usually do.

578
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,740
Here.

579
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,730
Eat up.

580
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,100
That's Ji Eun Oh.

581
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,690
You always...

582
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,880
have to eat rice soup with me, right?

583
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,870
You said it's your favorite food.

584
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,360
If I like something else,

585
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,140
would you eat it with me on the weekend?

586
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,960
Regardless of what you like,
you have to eat. Don't skip meals.

587
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,680
Geez. Didn't you hear what I said?

588
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,360
You wanted to go get something tasty.

589
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,630
Why do you change the subject without answering?

590
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,230
Don't you have anyone to eat with?

591
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,540
I'm busy on the weekend.

592
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,920
Are you busy this weekend, too?

593
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,300
Is the cafe doing that poorly?

594
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,810
So much so that you don't have to be there?

595
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,730
- No, but-
- Do you get paid as a manager?

596
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,580
Of course. I get plenty.

597
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,040
Is it sufficient?

598
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,240
- It covers living expenses.
- Like what, exactly?

599
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,190
Transportation, food,

600
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,000
miscellaneous expenses, and snacks?

601
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,000
I heard you only get paid 50%.

602
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,310
Hyeon Su told me that. She thinks you're funny.

603
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,190
How could I let Hyeon Su pay me
in full as a cafe manager?

604
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,170
She already invested so much into the cafe.

605
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,170
And she let me do the interior design.

606
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,250
She let me register my own business.

607
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,130
She let me use it as my office.
She pays me as a manager.

608
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,450
And she lets me do construction
work when I need to.

609
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,150
How amazing.

610
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,330
- It's totally amazing.
- Hey.

611
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,400
She didn't invest in the cafe because of you.

612
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,270
She moved it so Hangyeol Value
could continue to exist.

613
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,440
She needed someone to run the cafe,
and preferred a junior from the club.

614
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,400
Which means you are necessary for her to invest.

615
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,620
The cafe interior design?

616
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,240
She spent the bare minimum because you did it.

617
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,420
Letting you register your business
and providing the office space?

618
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,580
That wasn't hard as a landlord
and a successful architect.

619
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,300
You just need to feel thankful for her.

620
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,560
It's not your place to demand only half a salary.

621
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,740
Did you say it's not my place?

622
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,020
What do you think is my place?

623
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,360
I don't think you should be saving face.

624
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,410
Eun Oh, don't confuse this with pride.

625
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,450
Geez. Here's annoying self again.

626
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,050
I found it amusing that I hadn't
seen this side of you in a while.

627
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,060
Geez.

628
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,570
Wait. Well, hey...

629
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,700
Hey, hey! Wait...

630
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,430
Geez.

631
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,180
I should've said she takes the full salary first.

632
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,110
So, all you did was eat rice soup?

633
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,900
I couldn't even finish it.

634
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,200
I should've chugged the broth to feel satisfied.

635
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,500
It looks like you and the prickly
Ji Hyeok are meant to be.

636
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,620
Confessing your love wouldn't
be enough, but you argued instead?

637
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,400
I forgot that I was supposed to do that.

638
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,640
There's a hurdle after another.

639
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,410
Ms. Ji, don't get the wrong idea.

640
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,700
You've never overcome a hurdle.

641
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,660
Just confess over a drink.

642
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,760
Ask him for a drink, saying
you're stressed about a site.

643
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,030
No.

644
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:36,270
I'd drink all the alcohol at the bar,
be carried on his back,

645
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,930
and throw up on his back again.

646
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,070
Again?

647
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,650
I did it twice in college.

648
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,600
I did that every time I broke up
with my boyfriends.

649
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,370
You're right.

650
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,390
You two have always been like siblings.

651
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,850
Should I send him an email?

652
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:55,440
That's it. I could email him
without looking at his face.

653
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,260
 

654
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,150
 

655
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,920
 

656
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,550
 

657
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,060
Ji Eun Oh!

658
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,410
Ji Eun Oh,

659
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,120
someone hacked your email.

660
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,980
Someone sent something weird using your email.

661
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,200
No way...

662
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,710
Geez. You're crazy.

663
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,490
Do you sleepwalk?

664
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,220
What kind of nonsense is this?

665
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,150
I can't email him. No.

666
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,830
Just don't tell him, then.

667
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,100
- Give up.
- What?

668
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,430
To be honest, everyone knows he's anti-marriage.

669
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,840
You're 30. What comes after if he says yes?

670
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,240
Love.

671
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,900
Just love.

672
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,770
Were you anti-marriage, too?

673
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,530
Do you have to get married if you love someone?

674
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,720
Wow. I thought you were hoping to

675
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,590
change his mind while dating him,
and then marry him.

676
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,470
No.

677
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,190
I just want to tell him because I like him,

678
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,650
and I want him to be my special someone.

679
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,400
 

680
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,600
 

681
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,150
No, Mother.

682
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,740
No, Mother.

683
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,140
You have bad joints. You can't do stuff like this.

684
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,110
I'm being careful.

685
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,820
Leave it there.

686
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,910
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm okay.

687
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,760
- Gosh, Mother.
- Seriously.

688
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,940
Have a seat here.

689
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,110
It'd be bad if you hurt your legs doing that.

690
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,180
While walking down the stairs last fall,

691
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,090
you fell because one leg got weak.

692
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,620
Sit here. I'll hang the rest.

693
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,760
It's because I feel embarrassed.

694
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,010
Pardon?

695
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:46,850
I only use my hands when I eat

696
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,390
and when I wipe my butt.

697
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,910
You sometimes clean bean sprouts.

698
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,710
That's an unnecessary task.

699
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:02,060
The bean sprout ends peel right off
if you just wash them these days.

700
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,000
You refuse to go to the senior center.

701
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,410
Would you like to try a church?

702
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,790
What would I do there?

703
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,150
- Pray to God to hurry up and take me?
- Mother...

704
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,850
I didn't mean it like that.

705
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,930
I won't. I won't. Don't worry.

706
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,330
I...

707
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:34,090
won't pray to God or Buddha.

708
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,380
Your father-in-law was always sick

709
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,910
and injured over and over again.

710
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,950
I begged them to take him away

711
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,370
to stop making my son and daughter-in-law suffer.

712
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,880
I prayed until my palms wore out.

713
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:59,330
- Mother.
- Gosh, seriously.

714
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,490
Aigoo.

715
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:07,070
But he ended up dying at 90.

716
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,670
What a rotten old man.

717
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,780
Gosh, you're saying what you don't mean again.

718
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,260
After he passed away,

719
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,430
your pillow case was always wet with tears.

720
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,010
 Aigoo. 

721
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,480
- Gosh.
- You're here already.

722
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,780
Yes, Mr. Kim. Have a seat.

723
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,610
I've been wanting to see you before you retired.

724
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,740
But you never made time for me.

725
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,680
Since I was facing retirement,

726
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,390
I had a lot of work and meetings to catch up on.

727
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,240
Right.

728
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,960
When are you starting at Seongil Textile?

729
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,020
T-The thing is...

730
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:05,000
Someone sent fruit to Sang Cheol.

731
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,140
They sent it like this rather than in a package.

732
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,440
Someone must have sent a retirement gift.

733
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,980
Yes.

734
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,810
I'll answer the phone, Mother.

735
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,560
- Please check who sent it.
- Okay.

736
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,640
Aigoo, so pretty.

737
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,770
How pretty.

738
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,920
They are apples.

739
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,060
What's this?

740
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,010
I-It's money.

741
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,460
Mother, who's it from?

742
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,120
Look, Da Jeong.

743
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,960
I-It's money.

744
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,060
What money...

745
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,250
What's this...

746
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,710
 

747
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,460
 I'm sorry, Manager Lee. 

748
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,100
 We don't have a position for you. 

749
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,820
 The economy is so bad these days. 

750
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,550
When I heard you were joining Seongil Textile,

751
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:48,120
I thought you were so lucky.

752
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,800
Lucky?

753
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,540
I was lucky?

754
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:19,490
Ji Hyeok has a lot of things for his hobbies.

755
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:22,950
Is he taking all this when he moves out?

756
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:28,450
I think we could shoot with all these.

757
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,100
I'm home!

758
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,950
Why are you outside, Honey?

759
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,270
Gosh.

760
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,540
What's this?

761
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,390
Honey, the thing is...

762
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:56,150
Looks like Mr. Choi's family sent it.

763
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,690
Why would you accept this?

764
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,790
Can't you read Korean?

765
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,150
It says, "Choi Sang Hee and
Choi Min Shik of Seongil Textile."

766
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,630
But you opened it?

767
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:25,070
And you checked the money envelope inside, too?

768
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,800
You shouldn't have accepted it.

769
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,230
 Even if you got it, we could've returned it. 

770
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,460
 But you opened it. 

771
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,570
Aigoo, what do I do?

772
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,800
What are you thinking, exactly?

773
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,500
You want to turn me into a guy who gladly accepted

774
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,060
money for losing a job?

775
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,930
What are you thinking, exactly?

776
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,390
I'm sorry.

777
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,450
I thought it was for me
because I ordered something.

778
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:53,010
I opened it without thinking.

779
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:59,290
I'm so sorry. I made a huge mistake.

780
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,100
Bring it inside before the kids come home.

781
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,710
- All the opened pieces, too. Hurry.
- Okay.

782
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,310
Geez. Move.

783
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,520
Pick up all the scattered pieces.

784
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,710
Oh, no, Dad...

785
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,140
It's Ji Hyeok.

786
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,740
Oppa, Oppa, did you hear?

787
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,040
Lower your voice. I heard it.

788
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:53,440
Is he no longer working as
an advisor for Seongil Textile?

789
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,060
This happens all the time.

790
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:59,160
Poor Dad...

791
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,450
Let's wait to go inside.

792
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,730
Why did they take it back?

793
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,330
Can they just do that?

794
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,650
That's how the working world is.

795
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,220
Dad was just lucky.

796
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,300
What do we do?

797
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,480
Should we comfort him?

798
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,950
Didn't you hear him just now?

799
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,430
Play ignorant.

800
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,250
He'll tell us.

801
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,590
What will happen to him, then?

802
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,730
Ji Hyeok, shouldn't we provide living expenses?

803
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,380
I'm sure he'll find a solution.

804
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:00,040
I don't know why he was letting it out on Mom.

805
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,320
 

806
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,410
Ji Hyeok, did you sign a lease contract?

807
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,490
Yes.

808
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,300
Today was the day.

809
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,040
Will you tell them inside later?

810
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,350
I can't tell them I'm moving out now.

811
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,970
Will you not, then?

812
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:24,790
You should move out if you signed a contract.

813
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,450
I didn't say I won't.

814
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,610
I can't tell them today.

815
00:51:39,053 --> 00:51:42,870
 Ji Hyeok, you'll have to empty this room. 

816
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:43,879
 

817
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,000
 

818
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,040
 

819
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,800
Dad, you want me to empty the room?

820
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,640
Mom.

821
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,470
Ji Hyeok, the thing is...

822
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,350
The grandparents are coming from Tongyeong,

823
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,540
and they'll be living with us.

824
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,830
But since Grandpa can't walk well,

825
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,520
he'll use this room on the first floor.

826
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,670
You can take Ji Wan's room on the second floor.

827
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,410
What about Ji Wan?

828
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,970
Our renters will be moving out.

829
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,540
He can use their room.

830
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,360
Why do we have to live with our grandparents?

831
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,790
Grandpa switched to a bigger hospital in Seoul.

832
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:27,420
How about all this?

833
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,200
I'm sorry, Ji Hyeok.

834
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,860
We need to remove this and redo the wallpaper.

835
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,900
D-Don't apologize.

836
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,770
Why should you apologize for this?

837
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,950
A room is just a room.

838
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,100
 

839
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,310
 Guys, I was hired as an advisor
for Seongil Textile. 

840
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:20,920
 I already got a new job in the same field 

841
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,050
 right before retiring. 

842
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,910
 You want to turn me into a guy
who gladly accepted 

843
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,600
 money for losing a job? 

844
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,480
No wonder. I knew things were going

845
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,640
unusually well for our family.

846
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,970
 My family always lets me down. 

847
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:08,920
I'm sorry for calling late.

848
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,200
I won't be able to move into the apartment.

849
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,250
I'll cancel the lease contract.

850
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,900
 Gosh, why? 

851
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,450
 You lose 3 million in contract fee. 

852
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,000
I'm aware.

853
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,180
Send me the account number.
I'll pay the brokerage fee.

854
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,580
Okay.

855
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,750
Oppa.

856
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,570
Hey, babe.

857
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:02,190
What's with the outfit? Is today a special day?

858
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,770
Get in.

859
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,980
You said we need at least

860
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,220
a two-bedroom apartment to get married, right?

861
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:22,810
Yes.

862
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,090
- In Seoul.
- Yes.

863
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:28,200
- In Seoul.
- That's why I told you to save up.

864
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,540
We will only be dating until then.

865
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,300
You said that when I proposed to you a year ago.

866
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,630
I told you not to bring that up until you're ready.

867
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:37,410
No. The situation has changed.

868
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,840
You have three options, Hong Mi.

869
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
Three?

870
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,300
One. We live on the second floor of our house.

871
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,160
There are two bedrooms. We'll be using both.

872
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,950
It's basically separate.

873
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,260
Once my brother moves out,

874
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,690
Su Bin can move to my room.

875
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,790
Option Two.

876
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,900
We'll get a studio apartment
with help from my dad,

877
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,230
borrow my brother's marriage fund
and open a personal training gym.

878
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,730
I'll become a business owner.

879
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:04,370
Three. Get a two-bedroom apartment by borrowing

880
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,430
my brother's marriage fund.

881
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,860
I know...

882
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,930
all three options aren't inadequate for you.

883
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,950
But I have an incredible love

884
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:24,230
for you...

885
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:26,320
that no one else can give.

886
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,690
Okay.

887
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,860
Which one will you choose?

888
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,000
I'll give you an answer next time.

889
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,610
- Really?
- Yes.

890
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,790
Let's order a dessert now.

891
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,360
I'll have the truffle vanilla ice cream.

892
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,510
Excuse me, two truffle vanilla ice cream, please.

893
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,180
Okay.

894
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,970
 

895
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,010
 

896
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:31,696
 

897
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,520
 Did you leave? 

898
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,680
Mom, Mom, Mom...

899
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:41,970
Someone's back there. There's someone there.

900
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,860
What do I do? What do I do?

901
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,060
What do I do?

902
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,740
 Be calm. 

903
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,550
 I'll send in Mr. Jeong. Come out with him. 

904
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,530
He doesn't drive on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

905
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:21,440
 ♫ After a long time passed ♫ 

906
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:33,820
 ♫ Warm breeze is blowing next to me ♫ 

907
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:39,540
 ♫ At the end of deep darkness ♫ 

908
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,360
 ♫ I'm looking at you, my light ♫ 

909
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:53,990
 ♫ Light up my heart like the
warm spring sunshine ♫ 

910
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:59,180
 ♫ Under the quiet night sky ♫ 

911
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,760
 ♫ Looking at the moon shining brightly ♫ 

912
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:15,600
 ♫ I take a step forward slowly,
hoping to reach you ♫ 

913
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,060
Gosh!

914
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,840
Ji Eun Oh.

915
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,320
What's the deal with you?

916
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,540
Huh?

917
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:39,900
What a coincidence.

918
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,240
That sounds kind of weird.

919
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,070
Yes, very weird.

920
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:50,270
You've been to my neighborhood many times.

921
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:52,380
Oh, right.

922
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,830
I have.

923
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:56,940
I've been here a few times.

924
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,670
Is something going on?

925
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,940
Like what?

926
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,000
You followed me...

927
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,270
for no reason?

928
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:08,340
That can't be.

929
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,380
I need to tell you something.

930
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,080
Tell me what?

931
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:21,120
Sunbae, I heard you broke up.

932
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,650
How...

933
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,700
did you know that?

934
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:33,370
You probably don't have a new girlfriend yet.

935
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,600
Since you broke up recently.

936
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,530
- Ji Eun Oh.
- Take what I'm about to say

937
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:42,870
100% seriously.

938
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:45,430
Sunbae,

939
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:49,120
go out with me.

940
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,120
Hey, stop joking.

941
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,420
I'm not joking.

942
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,920
I'm suggesting we date, not get married.

943
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,940
We just ran into each other.
How can I believe you?

944
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,150
Let's go. I'll get you a taxi.

945
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,950
Sunbae,

946
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,840
you knew.

947
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,670
That I like you.

948
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,690
I knew it.

949
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,960
I suspected it.

950
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,590
What are you talking about?

951
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,860
What did you know?

952
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:30,260
I find this flustering, shocking, and unbelievable.

953
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,900
Did they invent alcohol that doesn't smell?

954
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,660
You're talking a lot.

955
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,740
It's unlike you.

956
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,870
I'm about to get angry.

957
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,770
I like you.

958
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:49,170
- You had to go there.
- I really like you.

959
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,480
Follow me.

960
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,500
Listen carefully.

961
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,690
I won't repeat myself.

962
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,920
I've liked you and waited for you for a long time.

963
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,630
- So, you need to give me a chance.
- No.

964
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:28,420
I'll pretend I didn't hear you.

965
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,110
Which means I'm saying no.

966
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:33,650
But you can't treat me differently.

967
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,080
Why would you say no without giving me a chance?

968
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,620
That's unlike you.

969
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,920
You always went out with
any club member who asked you out.

970
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,900
I didn't always.

971
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,590
I only went out with certain ones.

972
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,350
But why are you rejecting me?

973
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:52,850
Should a man explain why he's rejecting a woman?

974
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:55,290
Since when were we a man and a woman?

975
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,640
I know. I don't see you as a woman.

976
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,670
That's the most predictable answer.

977
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,130
You can see me as a woman once you start dating me.

978
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:09,510
Why would I date someone
I don't even see as a woman?

979
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,450
Because I'm Ji Eun Oh.

980
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:12,570
What?

981
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:16,330
Sunbae, I'm not just some woman.

982
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:17,990
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

983
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,790
I know I shouldn't be rejected so easily.

984
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:27,000
"I only think of you as a junior.
Never thought of you as a woman.

985
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,500
I get sick of people easily. I don't want
our breakup to ruin our friendship."

986
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,970
Saying stuff like that won't work.

987
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,860
I didn't know you could be smart like this.

988
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:40,970
So, if you won't give me a chance,

989
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:44,070
and not even give it a try,

990
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,400
you need to convince me.

991
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:54,170
You don't date because you're in love.

992
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,440
You dated someone fun who shares the same hobby.

993
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,730
Do you think I don't even know that?

994
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:01,430
- Eun Oh-
- The woman you liked the most is

995
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,690
Eun Ju, whom you broke up with in your third year.

996
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,500
You didn't know I'd know
how you feel so well, did you?

997
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,820
Eun Oh, what you're doing now...

998
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:19,260
your emotions...

999
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,000
It's nothing.

1000
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,910
Don't scare me as if you're serious.

1001
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:25,630
I understand how I feel.

1002
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,620
Don't you think I understand how I feel, too?

1003
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:29,550
Am I really...

1004
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,300
not even your candidate for dating?

1005
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:39,460
You'll never marry, yet even in your love life,

1006
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,190
there's no room for me?

1007
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,260
Bingo. That's it.

1008
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,310
Enough is enough.

1009
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:49,950
- What?
- Unless you want to cut ties with me,

1010
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,980
don't take this so lightly.

1011
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,910
Stop goofing around and feel bad, even a tiny bit.

1012
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,580
I'm sorry.

1013
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,660
No.

1014
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:22,130
Don't be sorry.

1015
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:23,890
If so,

1016
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:27,280
I'd have to accept your rejection.

1017
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,640
Eun Oh,

1018
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,390
you can't...

1019
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:34,310
force things like this.

1020
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:38,180
I'm not forcing it. I just don't understand.

1021
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:48,120
Is that so?

1022
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,020
If so,

1023
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,630
I'll give you the real reason.

1024
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,710
You and I...

1025
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,130
aren't compatible.

1026
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,600
What did you say?

1027
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,760
We are incompatible.

1028
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,800
You and I.

1029
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,380
I don't get...

1030
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,790
What do you mean-

1031
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,960
I thought you were cute since
you're a hardworking junior.

1032
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:27,140
Don't get smart with me.

1033
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,910
Not anymore.

1034
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,500
We aren't compatible?

1035
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,000
I don't have to give you
a chance when I don't think

1036
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,240
you're compatible with me.

1037
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:41,130
Right, Ji Eun Oh?

1038
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:13,200
 ♫ Your bright presence shines in the dark night ♫ 

1039
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:21,800
 ♫ As blindingly bright as the stars ♫ 

1040
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:29,110
 ♫ After a long time passed ♫ 

1041
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:32,910
 ♫ Warm breeze is blowing ♫ 

1042
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:36,140
 

1043
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,340
 He's so cruel. 

1044
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,260
 Can't you see Eun Oh is having a hard time? 

1045
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,500
 You told Eun Oh, didn't you? 

1046
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,960
 I know you like her! 

1047
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,940
 You never let me confess my love. 

1048
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,590
 Eun Oh. 

1049
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:49,060
 - Did you know?
- I'll return it. 

1050
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,520
 Don't carry it to them like this. 

1051
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,220
 Mr. Lee Ji Hyeok! 

1052
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,250
 What are you doing? Don't you have any manners? 

1053
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,910
 Other companies will be the same,
even if you quit here. 

1054
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:00,270
 Did you have a plan before you quit? 

1055
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:04,190
 There's no reason to reject a loveless marriage.
