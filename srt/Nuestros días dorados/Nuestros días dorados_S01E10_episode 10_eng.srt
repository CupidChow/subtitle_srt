1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,620
 

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,430
What's this?

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,700
Are you here as the CEO
since it's the first project?

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,150
No.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,820
- What is it, then?
- I'm here as a laborer today.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,370
Laborer?

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,560
You need a laborer on the first demo day.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,100
I'm that laborer.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,730
So, you'll be working here?

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,310
Yes. Right here.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,270
Are you joking right now?

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,840
The demo team and the laborer were predetermined.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,160
Before you took the job as a coordinator.

14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,140
Is that so? Okay.

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,870
I'll tolerate just today.

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,440
I just need to do that, right?

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,960
I'd like to be the laborer when one is needed.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,220
I get to hire the contractors.

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,990
I need to make money.

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,880
I need living expenses.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,390
I won't do it every day.

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,850
I'll only work when a laborer is needed.

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,650
I get to learn the work and check the site.

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,450
I get paid for the day, too.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,660
Why are you doing this to me?

26
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,360
You'll start in the morning
since you're a coordinator.

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,320
You'll decide if you'll come during lunch or not.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,870
We'll see each other at most three times a day.

29
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,460
But I'm a laborer first.

30
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,290
Shouldn't you just think of me as one?

31
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,190
No, Manager Ji?

32
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,420
Mr. Lee Ji Hyeok.

33
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,040
Okay. Fire me if you don't like it.

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,570
But...

35
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,240
you can't avoid seeing me.

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,750
As the CEO of Custom Homes,

37
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,390
I'll come often to monitor the first project.

38
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,100
You'll come as the CEO?

39
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,040
 Is this it? 

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,100
Gosh, Mr. Lee.

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,380
Hello.

42
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

43
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,010
Hello.

44
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,310
- You came early.
- Yes.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,020
To make it clear, everything here
will be demolished.

46
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,040
The bathroom tiles are so old that
they need to be removed, too.

47
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,730
Demolish everything
but the cabinet in the veranda.

48
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,920
And since we'll be painting the walls,

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,740
remove the wallpaper thoroughly.

50
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,670
Okay, got it.

51
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,270
Let's get started, then.

52
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,480
Let's get started.

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,330
- Okay.
- Okay.

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,420
You can leave now, Ms. Ji.

55
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,500
I know.

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,410
I'll avoid the dust bomb
and come back during lunch.

57
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,730
Thank you in advance.

58
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,260
Sure.

59
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,890
He wants to work as a day laborer?

60
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,220
He's so unpredictable.

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,710
 

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,130
Thank you.

63
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,820
You managed to add everything
despite the tight budget.

64
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,190
It's my job to find the solution.

65
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,130
You compromised on the materials, too.

66
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,990
I'm so excited.

67
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,560
Me, too.

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,920
Even though it's not your home?

69
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,370
When the space changes, the person changes, too.

70
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,520
It's more fun to cook in the kitchen,

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,700
and you feel better when you shower, too.

72
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,530
Your family gathers in the
living room more often, too.

73
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,980
I imagine that while designing.

74
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,060
And as I see the construction progress

75
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,010
and notice how things change,

76
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,240
it's so thrilling.

77
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,090
You really love your job.

78
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,870
These are the lighting and fabric
images that I thought you'd like.

79
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,190
We'll go through the materials together.

80
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,480
People often don't think
about the lighting and fabric

81
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,960
and panic about it later.

82
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,280
Oh, I see.

83
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,910
Thank you.

84
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,210
I'll get going now.

85
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,060
Okay. I'll prepare well
and start the construction.

86
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,300
Okay.

87
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,600
Wow. The coordinator's job is pretty good.

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,190
You just need to go in the morning and evening.

89
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,250
You hire the contractors based
on the schedule and get materials.

90
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,290
I don't have to design the details.

91
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,800
But I need to manage the workflow.

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,560
I'll stop by the site.

93
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,850
- You go in the afternoon, too?
- Yes.

94
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,320
I will, since it's the first day.

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,860
You'll come back and go back when the work ends?

96
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,380
I'll work at a cafe nearby

97
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,690
and see them finish off today.

98
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,080
Do that.

99
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,720
It's cheaper to get a coffee than pay bus fares.

100
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,420
I'll be back.

101
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,100
I think she needs a car.

102
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,200
Geez, that Gang Oh.

103
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,850
Mr. Lee, didn't you know you get paid for lunch?

104
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,090
- I know.
- Why are you eating cup ramen, then?

105
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,190
Didn't the demo manager order you food?

106
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,860
I'll take the money instead of getting the food.

107
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,340
Why? Are you bothered that I'm eating cup ramen?

108
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,000
I am. Very much so.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,700
You can't use muscles after eating that.

110
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,210
I know how much you eat.

111
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,430
You know how much a stranger eats, Manager Ji?

112
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,150
How are you a stranger?

113
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,460
You're a laborer at my job site.

114
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,830
You're right. I was Manager Ji's laborer.

115
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,840
Seriously.

116
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,950
My goodness. Mr. Lee is here, too.

117
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,750
Are you here because it's the first day?

118
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,470
Hello.

119
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,750
It's because this is our first project.

120
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,050
I'll work and check on things, too.

121
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,580
You'll work?

122
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,340
The schedule mentions the days with a laborer.

123
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,460
I'll be that laborer on those days.

124
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,880
But not for free.

125
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,790
You need to pay me for the day.

126
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,970
The CEO has a great mindset.

127
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,750
I love it. It's reassuring.

128
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,100
The demo team needs to leave.
As per my earlier text,

129
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,090
make payments to the manager and him.

130
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,480
Okay.

131
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,020
And lunch.

132
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,620
He ate lunch on his own.

133
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,030
Please add 10,000 won for lunch as well.

134
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,450
Okay.

135
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,010
You don't want to ride with me, right?

136
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,360
I was here earlier.

137
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,250
- Hey, how was today?
- Hold on.

138
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,000
The storage man is back, right?

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,910
The storage man?

140
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,510
 

141
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,730
Mr. Lee, be sure to get in line. Don't cut.

142
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,960
I should get on the bus first
if I were at the bus stop first.

143
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,590
I wanted to minimize the time you see me.

144
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,290
First-come, first-served.

145
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,540
Thank you.

146
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,330
What's going on with you two?

147
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,950
He came to work as a laborer at my job site.

148
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,720
Ji Hyeok did?

149
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,310
That's why you looked so upset.

150
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,290
He says he needs money.

151
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,570
How does he run a business if he has no money?

152
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,400
That's what I'm saying.

153
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,260
Why didn't you say anything when you came?

154
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,450
Because I thought I'd flip out if I said anything.

155
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,300
Su Jeong, I'm starving. I'll stop
by the convenience store.

156
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,900
Okay.

157
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,060
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

158
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,120
Hey, hey. Triangle gimbap again?

159
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,400
Hold on. What's this smell?

160
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,500
- It smells like ramen.
- Does it?

161
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,440
I guess I smell it a bit.

162
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,290
Oh, Ji Hyeok must be eating cup ramen again.

163
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,820
What?

164
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,640
I even gave him a note telling him
not to eat ramen in the storage.

165
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,770
 The bride must be walking a bit slowly. 

166
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,460
 Please come out, Bride. 

167
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,710
 I already know you're a shitty person. 

168
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,330
 Don't deny it, so you can pretend
to be a good person now. 

169
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,440
 It's not like you. 

170
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,610
 No. 

171
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,130
 This was Lee Ji Hyeok. 

172
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,400
 I didn't know. I had the wrong impression. 

173
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,740
 "Ji Eun Oh, since you're too poor, 

174
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,860
 you don't meet my criteria.
So, don't even look at me." 

175
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,490
 If you were honest like that,
I would've understood easily. 

176
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,690
 But until the end, you acted
like you were something. 

177
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,920
 "I don't have to share my thoughts.
You figure it out." 

178
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,930
 You gave me nonsensical, ridiculous excuses 

179
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,110
 and acted superior until the end. 

180
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,670
 What you wanted in the end
was getting comfortable, 

181
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,230
 upgrading your status, and getting rich
without an ounce of love. 

182
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,980
 That was it. 

183
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,660
 But you acted as if it wasn't. 

184
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,140
 As if you care about the weak and justice. 

185
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,410
 As if you weren't getting married to live freely. 

186
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,030
 I'm angry that you've been deceiving me like that. 

187
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,700
 It makes me so angry. Terribly angry. 

188
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,050
 Our relationship is over now. 

189
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,750
 We aren't sunbae, hoobae, or anything. 

190
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,330
 Got it? 

191
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,420
 Okay. 

192
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,630
I'm almost done cleaning.

193
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,840
Aigoo.

194
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,710
Ha Eun.

195
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,410
This is enough room, right?

196
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,850
It's a bit tight.

197
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,550
- But it works.
- Really?

198
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,790
Okay, okay.

199
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,260
Okay.

200
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,750
We can use this as a studio if we clear this.

201
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,480
What about the washer?

202
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,310
That? We don't have to move it.

203
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,760
- Hey, I got a great idea.
- What?

204
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,710
We'll take out one outfit at a time.
What do you say?

205
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,810
What do you say?

206
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,880
I must be a genius.

207
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,640
Here.

208
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,300
Relax and enjoy.

209
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,600
I'll eat when Dad comes home.

210
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,370
Eat a lot, Ha Eun.

211
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,710
Okay, ma'am. Thank you.

212
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,370
What's with my mom today?

213
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,840
Looks good.

214
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,200
She's such a good cook.

215
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,270
It's delicious. My gosh.

216
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,080
Let me check the response.

217
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,900
It's similar to yesterday.

218
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,620
 His face is blurry, but I can
sense his strong aura. 

219
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,250
 Where do I find a man like this? 

220
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,370
 He's a model, not a boyfriend. 

221
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,650
 He has so much chemistry with Bini. 

222
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,650
 I don't know what he's like, 

223
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,000
 but his physique and style are perfect. 

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,350
He's even more perfect in real life.
He's a chaebol heir.

225
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,600
No one's asking when our video will post.

226
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,540
 Bini, will he be in your next video again? 

227
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,680
 Can I have a blind date with him
if he's not your boyfriend? 

228
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,300
Dream on, guys.

229
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,630
He studied abroad, and he's sweet.
He's perfect. He's got everything.

230
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,820
Perfect?

231
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,780
Eun Oh, what are you doing here?

232
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,600
Oh, um...

233
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,810
I wanted to get out of Agit.

234
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,600
Really?

235
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,670
You felt that way about Agit?

236
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,050
I feel like I could understand, but then, I can't.

237
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,680
I'm uncomfortable because he's so different.

238
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,400
No, I guess it's because I can't understand.

239
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,300
The fact that he's starting a business
suddenly and coming back to our cafe.

240
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,010
The way he behaves, too.

241
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,600
I find everything unusual and strange.

242
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,650
Do I feel uncomfortable because
I can't tell what he's trying to do?

243
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,270
I can't pull all-nighters
at the cafe because of him.

244
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,300
Isn't he crossing the line
by barging into the job site?

245
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,030
- He is.
- Right?

246
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,540
But Eun Oh,

247
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,400
this is what I think.

248
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,300
What you need right now is a business mindset.

249
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,330
Business mindset?

250
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,630
I understand your feelings.

251
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,490
But you said you wanted to cut ties with him.

252
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,540
That means you want to move
on from the past relationship.

253
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,600
Then, maybe you just need to stop
thinking of him as an acquaintance.

254
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,850
Although I'm not sure what would come next.

255
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,090
You already share a space.
But you don't want him to say hello.

256
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,600
You want to treat each other
as if you didn't exist.

257
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,680
That looks like you still have a lot of feelings.

258
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,000
I no longer have feelings like that.

259
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,220
You were disappointed in him
as a person. You felt angry.

260
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,820
I understand that's why you don't
want to see him again.

261
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,400
I would've felt the same.

262
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,000
But you're already sharing a space.
You can't change that.

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,640
But if he helps your business,

264
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,020
you can still work with him.

265
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:15,000
I guess perhaps I couldn't separate work and life.

266
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,360
I'm just telling you not to waste your feelings.

267
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,220
 Perfect? 

268
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,070
 Yes. He's definitely perfect. 

269
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,780
 Someone we can't dare look at. 

270
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,460
I can look at him plenty.

271
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,120
He's my brother's best friend.

272
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,820
Yes, Seong Jae.

273
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,550
He's handsome, nice, and comes
from a great family.

274
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,650
He's educated, has a good job,

275
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,320
and he's rich, too?

276
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,870
It's him. It's Seong Jae.

277
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,240
That's right. Why didn't I think of that?

278
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,360
What's this?

279
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,050
 Su Bin, cheer up. 

280
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,360
 Fighting, my daughter. 

281
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,150
Mom.

282
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,240
Aren't you going to bed?

283
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,440
Aren't you tired?

284
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,310
I run half marathons every year.

285
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,180
You've been working every day, including weekends.

286
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,500
Studying is nice, but you should
rest for at least a day.

287
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,240
After I pass the written test first.

288
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,330
 Hi, Honey. 

289
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,270
 Let's push back today's lunch by 20 minutes. 

290
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,570
CEO Min Tae Wu of Hyeonyu Fashion
suddenly wants to stop by at 11.

291
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,180
I can't attend the scholarship ceremony, either.

292
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,400
For business?

293
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,780
 Yes. 

294
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,510
They're planning to launch a new line.

295
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,070
He said he suddenly thought of our shoes.

296
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,740
He's suggesting a collaboration.

297
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,000
He's suddenly suggesting something so major?

298
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,410
He's known for that.

299
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,240
His nickname is "Suddenly" because he's so hasty.

300
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,430
Let's just reschedule our lunch, then.

301
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,860
The conversation might take longer.

302
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,030
I feel so bad for you, though.

303
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,480
Come on. Don't say that.

304
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,770
I'll see you at home this evening.

305
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,750
- Yes, Mom.
 - Yeong Ra. 

306
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,600
Have lunch with Dad today.

307
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,050
Why?

308
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,380
It's a surprise.

309
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,390
 
We'll now start

310
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,720
the scholarship ceremony
for the second half of the year 2025

311
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,530
for Heerim, Dayun, Seongshil Girls,
and Haesang High Schools.

312
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,490
We'll start with the Director's welcome speech.

313
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,410
Hello, I'm Ko Seong Hui, the director
of Gaon Foundation.

314
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,290
I'll keep this short.

315
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:04,210
Because this event is for these students
who came on behalf of

316
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,940
all scholarship recipients, not me.

317
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,980
Thank you so much for focusing
on your studies despite challenges.

318
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,440
I hope you continue to head toward your dreams.

319
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,970
We'll start the scholarship award ceremony.

320
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,840
I'll take one now.

321
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,750
Let's smile.

322
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,410
Congratulations. Well done.

323
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,900
Thank you.

324
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,500
Ms. Ko, take them to the restaurant we reserved.

325
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,800
I'll take one with just students.

326
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,860
I asked you not to come because I'm embarrassed.

327
00:21:53,860 --> 00:22:00,000
There aren't many foundations
that do events this quietly.

328
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,240
It's not a big deal for a corporation
to sponsor students, Reporter Oh.

329
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,300
Where's the site?

330
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,800
I'll head over there.

331
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,180
Let's have lunch together.

332
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,520
 I'm working in the office today. 

333
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,070
I know the characteristics of stalkers.

334
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,120
Because I have experience.

335
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,120
A serious stalker doesn't back down easily.

336
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,790
He waits a long time looking for the right moment.

337
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,480
How dare he go after Park Yeong Ra?

338
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,150
No chance! I'll protect Park Yeong Ra!

339
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,110
Because I'm Oppa!

340
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,183
 

341
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,940
Yes, this is Lee Ji Wan.

342
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,800
 Pick up Yeong Ra at 11:30 at her studio. 

343
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,200
 - Please be punctual. 
- Yes, ma'am.

344
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,070
This wasn't part of her schedule today.

345
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,070
She never tells me why.

346
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,530
Only I don't know.

347
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,620
I just need to drive. Geez.

348
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,580
Why are you going to your father's office?

349
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,750
Mom told me to have lunch with him.

350
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,460
All of a sudden?

351
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,070
Yes.

352
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,760
Why?

353
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,600
I don't know.

354
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,080
Do you go out for lunch if you're told to?

355
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,420
Yes.

356
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,520
 

357
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,920
Dad, it's me.

358
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,880
I saw your office building
after meeting with a friend.

359
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,450
So, I thought of having lunch with you.

360
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,110
Is that so?

361
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,280
Yes. Come, Yeong Ra.

362
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,950
Okay.

363
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,450
Yes. What would you like to eat?

364
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,680
It'll take an hour and a half.

365
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,130
Okay. I'll be eating nearby.

366
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,270
You were here.

367
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,890
What got into you today?

368
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,110
Hello.

369
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,190
Yes, this is my friend.

370
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,560
He's CEO Min Tae Wu of Hyeonyu Fashion.

371
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,060
- This is my daughter.
- Is that so?

372
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,140
I'm Park Yeong Ra.

373
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,840
Gosh. You're more beautiful than what people say.

374
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,220
- Is she?
- Yes.

375
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,290
I thought she was only pretty to my eye.

376
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,750
Gosh, no way.

377
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,300
Geez. I'm starving.

378
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,740
What should I eat?

379
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,720
Huh?

380
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,260
Seong Jae.

381
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,700
Hey.

382
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,170
Huh?

383
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,030
Welcome.

384
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,420
Let's talk while we eat.

385
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,200
I need to eat quickly and go back.
I have a lot to do.

386
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,550
Say what you need to say.
I'll listen while eating.

387
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,240
I wish you'd speak.

388
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,520
About what?

389
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,890
Hey.

390
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,430
Before and after you came to Seoul,

391
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,440
you never said you're planning
to start a business.

392
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,830
You never discussed it with me.

393
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,890
I couldn't afford to talk, discuss,
or explain everything to you.

394
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,700
I didn't have the time.

395
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,330
You think that makes any sense?

396
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,420
Not everyone thinks the same way.

397
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,720
Different situations change things.

398
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,880
Just let it go, Seong Jae.

399
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,340
Is that why you decided
to use the storage as an office?

400
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,810
Yes.

401
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:18,380
Ji Hyeok, let's get you
a proper office. I'll invest.

402
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,860
- No, thanks.
- Why?

403
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,710
Because I'm fine now.

404
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,530
The image of a business is quite important.

405
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,820
And this isn't just about you.

406
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,780
How many years have we been friends?
And not just any friends.

407
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,910
My friend is starting a business.
Why shouldn't I invest in you to start?

408
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,420
It won't take a fortune.

409
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,560
It's okay because it doesn't take a fortune.

410
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,170
"Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous
will your future be." Don't you know?

411
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,900
Hey.

412
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,200
Aren't you being too cruel?

413
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,330
I know it's a business,

414
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,850
but I don't think you should let her
see you there every day.

415
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,000
I already discussed this with Eun Oh.

416
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,630
- I bet it was a notice.
- Are you siding with her?

417
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,200
It's not about siding with whom.

418
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,900
My investment will fix everything.
It'd be good for you and Eun Oh both.

419
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,960
Seong Jae, I have plans, too.

420
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,680
- I want to do this without anyone's help.
- Fine.

421
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,580
Same with your business.

422
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,090
You started it suddenly, out of nowhere.

423
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,900
Can you start a business in such
a short time? In just a few months?

424
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,630
I spent a day like 10 days and
an hour like 24 hours.

425
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,140
Stop being unreasonable.

426
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,470
You think so little of me, don't you?

427
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,800
Hey, how dare you tell me to move?

428
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,050
I don't know how you became
so close to Eun Oh while I was gone,

429
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,100
but shut your mouth.

430
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,800
Whether it's from you, my parents, or anyone,

431
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,100
I refuse any help. I'll go down if I have to.

432
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,120
Hyung! Hyung!

433
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,730
What happened? Were you in Seoul?

434
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,900
Did you just come to Seoul? When?

435
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,500
- What are you doing in this area?
- You answer me first!

436
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,150
No one is helping me.

437
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,790
Be quiet.

438
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,600
Tell me right now.

439
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,220
Don't tell the family that you saw me.

440
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,880
No! I'll tell them.

441
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,130
Why shouldn't I tell them?

442
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,980
Hyung, aren't you being too selfish?

443
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,680
Mom and Grandma worry about you so much.

444
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,490
- I know.
- If you know,

445
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,590
why don't you come home when you're in Seoul?

446
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,520
You couldn't even call?

447
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,580
Ji Wan, I started a business.

448
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,600
Business?

449
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,880
You remember how I ran away, right?

450
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,440
I do. It was miserable. Unbelievably so.

451
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,630
So, you understand how I'd want to return, right?

452
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,350
How do you want to return?

453
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,900
Don't you understand how I want
to settle down and return?

454
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,520
I understand, but I don't believe you.

455
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,540
It makes no sense. You left months ago.

456
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,770
What business? With what money?

457
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,040
Will you shut up if I show you?

458
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,470
What?

459
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,690
- Yes.
- Follow me.

460
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,390
Hyung, d-did you really start a business?

461
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,600
Lee Ji Hyeok, that troublemaker.

462
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,460
 

463
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,100
Hyung, why are we going into a cafe?
You said you have an office.

464
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,750
Come in.

465
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,200
Wow.

466
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,800
 

467
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,210
So, it was true.

468
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,850
Wow. CEO Lee Ji Hyeok.

469
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,400
I knew you could, Hyung.

470
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,600
Keep your mouth shut.
You'll be in trouble otherwise.

471
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,270
Of course. I know you turn
into Hulk when you're angry.

472
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:43,150
Okay. I won't tell anyone
until you become successful.

473
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,770
Make a glorious return, Hyung.

474
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,000
Gosh. Stop it.

475
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:53,910
Hyung, why are you dressed like this?

476
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,860
Get going already.

477
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,810
I have somewhere to be, too.

478
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,850
Ji Wan,

479
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,070
everyone's well, right?

480
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,470
Our family is strong...

481
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,230
I mean, we're waiting for you,
pretending to be strong.

482
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,920
Because we trust you.

483
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,860
Aigoo, you're having a late lunch.

484
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,330
It's 1,200 won.

485
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,690
I have a lecture to attend.

486
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,570
Have you worked here for a long time?

487
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,100
It's been a month now.

488
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,160
Do you find it difficult at all?

489
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,840
No, not particularly.

490
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,780
- Yes. Thank you.
- Take care.

491
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,760
Yes, thank you.

492
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,890
Hyeok! Ji Hyeok!

493
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,800
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

494
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,500
Gosh, silly me.

495
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,790
He won't even call once.

496
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,670
Come home and find out what I'll do.

497
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,780
 Let's get you a proper office. I'll invest. 

498
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,070
 Can you start a business in just a few months? 

499
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,720
 If you get a call from a job you
applied to, you'll come back, right? 

500
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,340
 You must've applied to a few places. 

501
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
 

502
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,520
You don't believe in me, either, huh?

503
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,720
Just like Eun Oh.

504
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,280
Not you, either.

505
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,830
Business mindset.

506
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,680
Keep work and life separate.

507
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,530
I thought you got a window because it felt stuffy.

508
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,230
Keep the door shut since you made
a hole in a perfectly fine door.

509
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,040
Why are you looking at me like that?

510
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,900
It's so refreshing.

511
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,140
People have many sides.

512
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,780
Pardon?

513
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,430
I'm not angry.

514
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,380
I'm surprised.

515
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,280
You have many hidden talents.

516
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:56,890
You became close friends with Seong Jae, too.

517
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,010
You must've told him you hate me so many times.

518
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:04,470
He got so angry just like you,
because I went to the job site with you.

519
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,250
You have a talent.

520
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,790
What did you mean by that?

521
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,810
I have a talent?

522
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,220
Who do you think I am?

523
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,890
How dare you mock me? I have a talent?

524
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,390
What do you mean by that?

525
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,570
You can hate me all you want,
but give it a rest, Manager Ji Eun Oh.

526
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,690
Give it a rest.

527
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,280
Am I your enemy who sold your family out?

528
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,800
Yes, let's be strangers. Strangers.

529
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,700
- Is that so hard?
- You're the one who barged in here.

530
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,100
Right.

531
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,600
I did that.

532
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,060
You're right.

533
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,200
I feel bad again.

534
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,410
Whoever this place belongs to,
and no matter how poorly I treated you,

535
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,420
you have no right to be snarky with me.
Why are you snarky?

536
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,080
Seong Jae and I've known
each other for nine years, too.

537
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,000
I see. Got it.

538
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,730
I apologized. Should we stop now?

539
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,330
I won't leave the door open again.

540
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,970
 ♫ A tiring day has passed ♫ 

541
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,700
 ♫ Yet in the same spot ♫ 

542
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,500
 ♫ While looking at me quietly ♫ 

543
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,530
 ♫ Just saying, "Thank you for your hard work" ♫ 

544
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,570
 You must've told him you hate me so many times. 

545
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,750
 He got so angry just like you,
because I went to the job site with you. 

546
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,490
 You have a talent. 

547
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,760
Why did I say that?

548
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,770
Why did I have to say that?

549
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,790
They're friends.

550
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,780
You should've held back, Lee Ji Hyeok.

551
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,270
You had no right to talk to Eun Oh like that.

552
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,600
Geez. Seong Jae, that punk.

553
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:22,510
 ♫ Always with you ♫ 

554
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,080
 You passed the first round of Double S Start-up's 

555
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,530
 2025 New Business Competition. 

556
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,010
That's right.

557
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,860
This is how it should be.

558
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,300
This is how Lee Ji Hyeok is.

559
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,000
 I'll never forgive Ji Hyeok. 

560
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,380
I made him give up on studying abroad.

561
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,820
And he studied business to get a job.

562
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:51,290
That's why he decided not to
get married and have children

563
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,700
like everyone else, and did nothing.

564
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,610
That's my fault.

565
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,240
It means I'm a pathetic dad.

566
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,880
That was it.

567
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,080
I was wondering why you were struggling so much.

568
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,540
You've been hurt by your son. That was it.

569
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,920
No, you were more than hurt.

570
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,650
He dismissed my entire life's work.

571
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:22,150
Sang Cheol, that's blowing things
out of proportion.

572
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,100
Isn't it funny? I followed that man.

573
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,700
I thought a stranger was Ji Hyeok.

574
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:35,350
Once our kids mature,
they're difficult and scary, too.

575
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,680
Yes. You start tiptoeing around them.

576
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,880
Yet you act like you don't.

577
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,600
You act like you're a tough dad.

578
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:50,260
I won't do that anymore. Never.

579
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,360
You take classes and work every other day.

580
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,950
- Are you handling it okay?
- Of course.

581
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,690
I still got it. I'm fine.

582
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,010
Are you going out today, too?

583
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,640
Yes, I told you.

584
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,350
I met my hometown friend, Myeong Suk.

585
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:15,260
Her neighborhood's senior center is so nice.

586
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,520
What area is the senior center in Ojeong?

587
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,380
I don't know.

588
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,700
I won't just hang out at the senior center.

589
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,440
I'll go to Myeong Suk's house
and visit other people's houses, too.

590
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,960
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

591
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,940
Talk about being a late bloomer.

592
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,280
She's a homebody, but she's
been going out a lot lately.

593
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,690
 Getting a job with an elementary
school teacher's certificate. 

594
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,890
 In late 50s. 

595
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,660
 

596
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,950
 

597
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,430
 

598
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,630
 You measure the walls when you build cabinets 

599
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,600
and build it flush to the front, not the wall.

600
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,660
So, you fill the gap with caulking inside
or cover it with moulding, right?

601
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,180
Wow. Mr. Lee, you studied a lot.

602
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,280
It's not easy to learn tricks like this.

603
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,050
Mr. Lee, work as a laborer
if you're here for that.

604
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,020
Don't bother the carpenter.

605
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,380
I asked him because he was taking a break.

606
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,430
But you aren't working.

607
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,530
We're about to finish up.
Won't you start cleaning up?

608
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,780
Sir, what's your go-to spot for materials?

609
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,170
I like your stuff. Have you worked
with them for long?

610
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,510
He just won't stop.

611
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,930
Will you keep working with me, Mr. Lee?

612
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,950
I'll tell you, then.

613
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,410
Mr. Cha.

614
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,520
Yes, Manager.

615
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,190
Doesn't the shadow look funny?

616
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,890
It looks perpendicular.

617
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,380
But you can see the shadow bending.

618
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,050
Yes, you're right.

619
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,800
Was the top part of the frame pushed back?

620
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,500
This will be visible under wall lights.

621
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,650
I think the frame will be fine
if you fix this one sheet.

622
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,240
Pretty good.

623
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,310
- Mr. Cha.
- Yes.

624
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,030
Come here for a second.

625
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,880
Do you see this?

626
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,590
What?

627
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,630
I got in first.

628
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,080
Seriously. He never keeps his promises.

629
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,450
Thank you.

630
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,020
Be alert.

631
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,210
Did you talk to me casually just now?

632
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,630
I did. So what?

633
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,410
Get off.

634
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:44,390
Talking to Director Park Seong Jae
about his friend...

635
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,420
I was out of line.

636
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,340
I was out of line for being snarky about it.

637
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,360
I guess we're even, then.

638
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,890
Call it even, huh?

639
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,150
I'm back.

640
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,220
Did you make up? You came back together.

641
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,480
We didn't.

642
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,800
You did. You were just a few steps apart.

643
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,680
Oh, that?

644
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,120
I guess the tenant and I arrived back-to-back.

645
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,020
- Huh?
- How much did we make today?

646
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,250
We made enough.

647
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,830
How are you? Huh?

648
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:46,330
You even paid for the damages
at the cafe because of Gang Oh.

649
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:51,220
I'll think of it as a price to teach him a lesson.

650
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,500
Construction for the Mapo apartment was scheduled.

651
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,130
Keep that in mind.

652
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,860
When is it?

653
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,020
I put the schedule in front of your office.

654
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,020
She's still doing that.

655
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,140
She has no business mindset.

656
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,570
Remove the card.
I'll let you know when it's ready.

657
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,110
Thank you.

658
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,920
Manager Ji, what's this?

659
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,760
My plan not to overlap schedules
for Custom Homes and the Mapo project.

660
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,310
You need to brief me on this...

661
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,910
ma'am.

662
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,150
On the first demo day for Eunoh-ism,

663
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,900
I'll go to the Mapo job site
when the construction starts.

664
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,360
No need to go to Custom Home's site in
the morning. It'd be the second day of painting.

665
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,200
I just need to check the painting
job in the afternoon.

666
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,590
I'll go to Custom Home's job site
on Day 2 of demo day for Mapo.

667
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,300
That's when we do the flooring.

668
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,490
And I'll go to my job site in the afternoon.

669
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,040
I need to inspect since it's the last demo day.

670
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,290
If you look at the dates, you'll see the
Os and Xs for mornings and afternoons.

671
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:30,830
That's to make sure my schedule doesn't overlap

672
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,180
and affect the constructions.

673
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,380
Should I continue?

674
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,670
No, I get it now. I see everything.

675
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,670
Wow, you're so smart.

676
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,020
You used Custom Homes' job schedule

677
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,720
to schedule construction for Mapo.

678
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,740
I did, but...

679
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,350
you're sounding more casual.

680
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:55,710
Huh?

681
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:01,680
Well, no. I'm just impressed, ma'am.

682
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,450
Was she always that smart?

683
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,300
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

684
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,440
Hey.

685
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,850
You're all over the news.

686
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:26,460
Who gets tricked by a fake stock company?

687
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,820
You think I wanted to?

688
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,430
Look at you.

689
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,800
The dating bar almost got scrapped because of you.

690
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,750
Yang Jin Gu happily joined in, thanks to you.

691
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,700
Seo Dong Wu, are you provoking me?

692
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,230
"Are you provoking me?"

693
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,590
Geez, Ji Gang Oh.

694
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,770
Gang Oh, just get 20 million from your family.

695
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,940
I'll make you a business partner, then.

696
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,990
Instead, you have to work at the bar, too.

697
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,310
I'm making you a shareholder
for 20 million because you're good-looking.

698
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,140
2-20 million?

699
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,430
Yes.

700
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,810
Forget it, Gang Oh.

701
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:09,450
Your sister cleaned up your mess.

702
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,670
You have no more money.

703
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,890
How do you know if I have money or not?

704
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,020
I don't, but my mom has some.

705
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,880
 

706
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,910
- Hey, where are you going?
- What's with him?

707
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,160
Gang Oh, we have a lot of customers.

708
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,360
 You said you'd be back soon.
What's taking so long? 

709
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,180
How many customers do you have?

710
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,540
Enough that I want to call Noona.

711
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,250
Okay. I'm going.

712
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,900
He's scared of his sister, but he hasn't
learned his lesson.

713
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,800
That man looks like Dad.

714
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,710
Are you here for No. 702 construction?

715
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,670
Yes, yes, yes.

716
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,680
I'm Lee Sang Cheol, who's starting the job today.

717
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,250
I see. Hello.

718
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,150
- I'm managing the construction.
- I see.

719
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,320
You still had time. Why did you run earlier?

720
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,130
Well, it's my first time at an interior job site.

721
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:57,080
I wanted to look around in advance.

722
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,940
But the security office won't let me in.

723
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,110
Oh, I see.

724
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,040
Ahjussi, show me your hands.

725
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,570
My hands?

726
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:14,960
You've only held pens your whole life.

727
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,050
You have no calluses.

728
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,320
Are your shoulders and back okay?

729
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,710
Of course.

730
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,700
I've never worked at an interior job site,

731
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,670
but I've done loading, unloading, sorting,

732
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,200
and displaying. I've done everything.

733
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,340
I know.

734
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,720
My dad worked all sorts of jobs
when his business failed.

735
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,300
I see.

736
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:43,060
I thought you looked like
my dad for three seconds.

737
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,030
That's why I became so chatty.

738
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,320
Just do what the demo manager tells you to do.

739
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,600
Although it'd be a lot-

740
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,810
Manager Ji.

741
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,630
You made it.

742
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,930
Gosh, thank you for calling me again.
Good to see you.

743
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:02,080
Do a clean job like you did last time.

744
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,210
Of course.

745
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,540
And say hello. This is Mr. Lee Sang Cheol.

746
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,070
This is Manager Gong of the demo team.

747
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:11,050
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

748
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:15,670
We're demolishing everything,
but I marked the walls just in case.

749
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,440
I turned off the heat and water, too.

750
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,400
Gosh, got it.

751
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,630
Give us the drinks and get going.
Before you're covered in dust.

752
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,000
Okay.

753
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,960
Let's go. Let's go inside.

754
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,350
Ahjussi, don't wear a normal mask.

755
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,430
You need a dust mask.

756
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,440
Okay, okay.

757
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,370
Yes, we're doing work at No. 702.

758
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,050
Let's go.

759
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,550
Hey, I said you don't have to come in.

760
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:49,300
I'll stay only a bit. I have a client meeting.

761
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,010
I marked the walls.

762
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,240
Okay, got it.

763
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,960
I'll get going now. Thank you.

764
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,870
 - Take care.
- Bye. 

765
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,280
Director Ko.

766
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,500
Long time no see, Manager Ji.

767
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,590
I've been too negligent, haven't I?

768
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,930
No, you said you've been busy.

769
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,250
I've been working, too.

770
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,240
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

771
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,530
Good to see you.

772
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,190
Likewise.

773
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,110
I've decided, thanks to the
four versions you created.

774
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,930
What did you decide?

775
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:59,680
Our studio will, of course, have two painters,

776
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,050
and one stationary or houseware designer.

777
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,580
I'm thinking about having three people.

778
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,340
Metal smithing is cool, but it'd be noisy.

779
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,510
More than three might feel too crowded.

780
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:15,600
Not just artists, but people
in general need space.

781
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,250
Yes.

782
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,740
We can use the walls for displaying
with two painters, right?

783
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,190
Of course.

784
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:28,160
How about you open up the
studio space for the artists?

785
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,960
Even with glass partitions,

786
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,910
being able to see them working
would be interesting.

787
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,870
We should ask the candidates first.

788
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,700
They may find it distracting.

789
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,420
But keeping the stationery and
houseware design space open might work.

790
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,370
We should choose the artist sponsors first, then.

791
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:52,480
Should we explore the studio aesthetics first?

792
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,210
I saw this space in a magazine. I like the design.

793
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:04,680
It's uncomplicated, simple, and warm.

794
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,300
That's exactly what I said.

795
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,370
Do you like glass craft?

796
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:41,100
I like the objects that interact with the space.

797
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,860
I know. We got drawn to this.

798
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,100
Yes. It's beautiful.

799
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,980
By the way, let me ask you something.

800
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,190
I mean, let me guess.

801
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,080
Pardon?

802
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,390
I don't think it's work-related.

803
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:05,070
It can't be romance since you aren't dating.

804
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:09,800
Why do your eyes look tired to me?

805
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,710
Or should I say confused?

806
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,890
I sensed that ever since I first met you.

807
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,560
Gosh. I'm sorry.

808
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,520
Maybe I wasn't very focused.

809
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,300
No, no. I'm just saying I sensed that.

810
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,720
Briefly here and there.

811
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,270
It looks like you're blaming yourself.

812
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:41,300
There's someone I dislike.

813
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,880
He wronged me...

814
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,060
and he's exactly the type I dislike.

815
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:53,770
I'm more generous toward people
who are struggling,

816
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:59,240
but I can't do that in this case.
That must bother me.

817
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:06,110
Then, just be generous to him.

818
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,480
If it's hard for you to be harsh with him,

819
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,620
it means you can't hate him completely.

820
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,950
Excuse me.

821
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,750
I'm okay, Director. This is too much.

822
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,400
How do you know if it is?

823
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,180
It didn't even have a price tag on it.

824
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,630
I know this artist.

825
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,120
Really?

826
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,290
I'm glad I bought it.

827
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:42,200
I bought something you love.

828
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,810
I should be praised.

829
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,700
But still, this is...

830
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,460
Does this look like a gift to you, by the way?

831
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,760
Do you think I'm giving you a gift?

832
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,410
What is it, then?

833
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,050
Courage.

834
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,410
I'm giving you courage.

835
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:04,800
I want to tell you to cheer up,
but words have no power.

836
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,740
That's why I'm giving this to you.

837
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:11,980
I want you to be brave and
get back to your old self.

838
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:16,180
That way, you could focus on my project better.

839
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:23,200
A gift brings more joy to the one who gives it.

840
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,800
Here.

841
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,910
I'll accept it, then.

842
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,630
Thank you so much, Director.

843
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:40,910
Enjoy.

844
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,930
Gang Oh, what's with you today?

845
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,820
You can't focus at all.

846
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:53,540
You mistook the table number
and mixed up the to-go order.

847
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,860
Are you sick?

848
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:00,710
Well, my stomach has been hurting since earlier.

849
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,020
Your stomach? Why is that?

850
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,820
- Do you need to see a doctor?
- No, no. I don't.

851
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,080
I should rest at home.

852
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,030
Call the part-timer for the dinner shift, Mom.

853
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,390
You think resting would do?

854
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:14,370
I'll stop by the pharmacy.

855
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:41,180
 Your sister needs to find
someone nice and get married. 

856
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,280
 Women can't get married
without money these days. 

857
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,510
 Of course not. 

858
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,720
Yes. There's one.

859
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,300
Mom has a bank book for Noona.

860
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:57,850
The closet is the secret storage for
homes without a safe or money.

861
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:35,260
The old bank books are here.

862
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,430
The likelihood of it being here is 87.5%.

863
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,260
What's this?

864
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,560
 
From when Dad passed away?

865
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,180
Why does she still have the renunciation
of inheritance form?

866
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,210
Mom is so apprehensive.

867
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:56,170
In case creditors come after her again?

868
00:59:56,170 --> 01:00:00,070
Seriously. She's fragile. Fragile.

869
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,330
 

870
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,720
What's this?

871
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:26,360
 

872
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,200
Aigoo...

873
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,900
The old man...

874
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,800
Sir! My gosh, sir. Oh, no...

875
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,030
Get off now.

876
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,880
Get off right now!

877
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,180
Are you crazy?

878
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,030
Did you see it? Do you have evidence?

879
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,070
It's all on your dash cam. Get off now!

880
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:06,690
Move!

881
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,340
Help! He hit someone!

882
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:12,820
Help! He hit someone! Help!

883
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:16,900
Hey! What are you doing? Move the car over here.

884
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,690
You aren't letting people pass.
What are you doing?

885
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:22,550
An old man is on the ground. It's a hit and run!

886
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,200
This is a hit and run. Get off.

887
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,490
It's a hit and run. Please help.

888
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:27,260
I called the police. Get off first, ahjussi.

889
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,500
- Did you see it?
- I see the old man on the ground.

890
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,500
Hurry. Get off now.

891
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,720
Everyone is watching you now.

892
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:39,980
Get off now.

893
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,840
Right there.

894
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,010
It says "adopted" at the bottom. What's that?

895
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,680
What does it mean?

896
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:04,550
Noona...

897
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,470
Ji Eun Oh wasn't my birth sister?

898
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:19,310
It's obviously a hit and run.

899
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:28,300
Get off now. The old man is on the ground.

900
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,010
Get off now.

901
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,690
Get off.

902
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,910
How pathetic.

903
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,780
I gave birth to a kid like that?

904
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:12,500
 ♫ It's okay not to tell me ♫ 

905
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:18,880
 ♫ Lean on me and close your eyes ♫ 

906
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,900
 ♫ And you'll feel better ♫ 

907
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,170
 It wasn't a normal remarriage. 

908
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,350
 I have nothing to show. 

909
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:31,040
 A tiger without teeth can't eat anything. 

910
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,480
 Why won't your mother tell you?
Aren't you frustrated? 

911
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,420
 Seong Jae? Is he her boyfriend or something? 

912
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,800
 Why did you come so early, ma'am? 

913
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,440
 A coordinator's job is to be responsible
for the beginning and the end. 

914
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,680
 So stubborn. So annoying. 

915
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,670
 She's not your birth daughter! 

916
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:51,530
 You've been bossing me around
when we aren't blood related? 

917
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,750
 Who are you? 

918
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:56,290
 Why should I care about Ji Eun Oh? Read the air.
