1
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,930
 

2
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,460
Come with me for now.

3
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,490
Bo Ah, you keep getting texts.

4
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,130
It's Oh Hui Kyeong.

5
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,710
It's a friend who went to Australia
for a honeymoon a few days ago.

6
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,210
Excuse me for a second.

7
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,630
Give me.

8
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,050
 Bo Ah, I'm in Melbourne. 

9
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,790
 This welder is Seo Jae Wuk, right? 

10
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,560
I'll get going now.

11
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,740
How...

12
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,110
What happened?

13
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,200
Check your texts.

14
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,060
 I'm sorry. I'm going to him. 

15
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,550
 I just found out where he is. 

16
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,560
 I'm sorry, Ji Hyeok. 

17
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,110
Honey, something must be up.

18
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,500
Where are the in-laws going?

19
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,040
Is Bo Ah sick?

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,770
Hey, S-Su Bin, get Ji Wan.

21
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,460
Never mind. Go and find out what's going on. Hurry.

22
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,430
Okay.

23
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,250
I apologize to the guests who came to this wedding.

24
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,910
Today's wedding was canceled
due to a personal reason.

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,080
What are you talking about right now?

26
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,840
CEO Jeong wants to apologize to you.

27
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,940
I think you should go back home now.

28
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,130
You should tell us if the bride is okay.

29
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,470
The wedding suddenly can't happen.

30
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,690
But he said he'll explain later.

31
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,900
But look, we need to explain to our guests.

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Just say the bride has a health issue.

33
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,910
Wait...

34
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,800
What's he talking about?

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,880
Is the bride sick, or is he asking
us to pretend she is?

36
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,180
Su Bin,

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,570
take Ji Hyeok's car and take
Grandma, Mom, and Dad home.

38
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,850
We need to talk to Ji Hyeok.
What happened to Bo Ah?

39
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,710
Hey, the bride ran away.

40
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,900
What?

41
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,740
What are you whispering?

42
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,630
I want to know, too.

43
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,520
No, Grandma.

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,650
So, take Mom and Dad home.

45
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,530
Don't let them be humiliated here.

46
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,330
I need to take care of things
with Seong Jae. So, do that.

47
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,280
- Okay.
- What?

48
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,290
Grandma.

49
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,320
Mom and Dad,

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,480
let's go home.

51
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,060
How could we leave like this?

52
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,140
We need to know why.

53
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,270
We need to go home first. Please, Dad.

54
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,920
We need to know what's going on.

55
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,750
Go ahead and find Ji Hyeok.

56
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,850
He's not here. I'll tell you
on the way home. Please.

57
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,680
Let's find out first.

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
Let's go home.

59
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,820
Let's go.

60
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,550
The bride ran away.

61
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,160
The bride ran away?

62
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,720
I heard while I was out.

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,890
She apparently went back to her ex.

64
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,960
Gosh, my goodness.

65
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,140
I know. How humiliating.

66
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,360
- Call her.
- No, let me try.

67
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,100
- Who are you calling?
- What about Ji Hyeok?

68
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,760
I know.

69
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,840
Everyone,

70
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,850
please make sure to enjoy the meal before you go.

71
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,680
You should rest here.

72
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,930
I'll do some damage control.

73
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,510
I can't believe this.

74
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,500
The bride ran away, then?

75
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,190
Look at you now, Lee Ji Hyeok.

76
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,220
I knew this would happen.

77
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,870
Idiot.

78
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,160
Gosh, so annoying.

79
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,280
Pisses me off.

80
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,150
Su Bin, tell us now.

81
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,100
Why did this happen? Huh?

82
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,250
Well, the thing is...

83
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,550
Su Bin, tell us if you know something.

84
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,640
I guess Bo Ah had someone else.

85
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,030
What?

86
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,570
"I'm sorry, Ji Hyeok. I'm going to him."

87
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,900
She sent a text like that to Ji Hyeok's phone.

88
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,660
Who's she going to?

89
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,410
I have no idea what you're saying.

90
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,350
I don't think they were dating.

91
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,450
He was marrying someone he wasn't dating.

92
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,430
But why?

93
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,240
 

94
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,750
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

95
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,440
 Please call again later. 

96
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,610
You came.

97
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,840
Thank you.

98
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,660
 Hangyeol Value's former and current members 

99
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,530
 will throw him an afterparty. 

100
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,350
Gosh, look at this.

101
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,830
Gosh, seriously.

102
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,910
Eun Oh, you came.

103
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,300
- Hey.
- You came early.

104
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,120
How did you guys come in here?

105
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,940
Su Jeong gave us the passcode.

106
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,090
Yes.

107
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,530
Eun Oh, how many tables should we set?

108
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,000
Well...

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,530
S-Six.

110
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,500
Why did you come so early?

111
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,220
Eun Oh!

112
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

113
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,220
Hello.

114
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,530
Hold on.

115
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,860
You came.

116
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,940
You prepared a lot.

117
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,090
People in their 20s get things done instantly.

118
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,650
- Where? There?
- Yes.

119
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,160
- You came.
- Come this way.

120
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,590
Sunbaenim, should we be doing this today?

121
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,270
Should we throw everything away, then?

122
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,130
I don't think we should be celebrating today.

123
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,750
This is why we love you, right?

124
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,410
No one dislikes you.

125
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,930
Pardon?

126
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,960
But Eun Oh,

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,500
not everyone needs to worry
when someone faces misfortune.

128
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,900
And I'm sure they aren't just worried.

129
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,790
Sometimes, curiosity is bigger than worries.

130
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,830
I'm not sure what you mean.

131
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,940
I'm saying that's just how life is.

132
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,030
It's not a big deal.

133
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,820
- Sunbaenim, hello.
- Hello.

134
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,670
Sit here.

135
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,100
 

136
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,300
 

137
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,500
 

138
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,030
It's so tasty.

139
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,580
Eun Oh, sit here.

140
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,100
Yes, let's drink together. Come.

141
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,140
I'm a manager here. I should work.

142
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,870
Maybe Jeong Bo Ah's dad paid him or something.

143
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,280
The guy disappeared without
a trace about a year ago.

144
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,290
So, she gave up.

145
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,490
Her father pushed the wedding in the meantime.

146
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,010
Eun Oh, you know, right?

147
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,360
How did Ji Hyeok and Bo Ah end up together?

148
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,080
I don't know.

149
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,050
Su Jeong.

150
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,920
So, how do you all know
about Ji Hyeok's runaway bride?

151
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,840
When we were in college, we remodeled

152
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,170
Edel Orphanage, the biggest one in Cheongpo-si.

153
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,580
Six colleges in Seoul worked together.
It was a big project.

154
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,950
And a man from the orphanage hit it off
with Jeong Bo Ah. It was a big deal.

155
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,760
Have Ji Hyeok and Bo Ah been in touch since then?

156
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,970
I don't know.

157
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,900
You know Ji Hyeok doesn't talk about his life.

158
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,340
Gosh, what happened to Ji Hyeok?

159
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,470
Call him.

160
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,740
He's not answering.

161
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,700
The bride had acute appendicitis.
What could we do?

162
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,370
Hey, I'll hang up.

163
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,330
Ji Hyeok, what are you doing right now?

164
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,230
How could you put us in this situation?

165
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,320
Mom and Dad are calling people
to apologize and return money gifts.

166
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,410
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,200
 Yes, I'm sorry. 

168
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,770
Give me your account number first.

169
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,890
No, no. We don't know when
we'll have another wedding.

170
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,720
Ji Hyeok is here.

171
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,880
Okay. Text me, then.

172
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,840
You bastard.

173
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,100
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,490
I put you two in a difficult position. I'm sorry.

175
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,990
Difficult?

176
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,030
Did you say difficult just now?

177
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,270
Honey, let's hear his explanation.

178
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,600
Sit, Ji Hyeok.

179
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,550
Is it true that she went to her ex?

180
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,560
Were you not dating?

181
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,230
No.

182
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,010
My goodness.

183
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,460
I-If so...

184
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,590
I-If so, why did you try to get married?

185
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,820
Because we both needed this marriage.

186
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,070
Needed?

187
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,700
Needed what?

188
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,470
Looks like she tried to forget her ex.

189
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,530
How about you? Why did you need her?

190
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,320
Because she's Haneul Construction's daughter.

191
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,740
What? Because she's Haneul
Construction's daughter?

192
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,360
My gosh.

193
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,980
What do you mean by that?

194
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,090
So, because she's from a rich family,

195
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,360
you wanted to marry her because of her background?

196
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,570
With a woman you weren't even dating or liked?

197
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,900
I think marriage is a matter of necessity.

198
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,360
Ji Hyeok.

199
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,360
 You crazy bastard! 

200
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,670
He should beg for forgiveness.

201
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,700
What's he doing? Gosh...

202
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,570
Is he home?

203
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,850
What about the venue? What happened?

204
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,590
I wrapped things up with Seong Jae.

205
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,410
This bastard is totally out of his mind.

206
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,950
Are you serious right now?

207
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,970
Are you out of your mind?

208
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,090
How could a man try to marry for status?

209
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,120
You always bring up being a man,

210
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,990
but men can't necessarily
be the breadwinners anymore.

211
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,410
The time has changed.

212
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,110
Our generation doesn't think
you need to marry someone you love

213
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,400
or it's necessary to marry.

214
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,380
Here we go again. Are you blaming the era again?

215
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,720
You think we were well off back then?

216
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,640
We struggled thousands of times more than you.

217
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,390
I want to live a comfortable life.

218
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,720
Living a lifetime with someone you love?

219
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,500
Sacrificing as the head of the family?

220
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,670
I grew up while barely able to support myself,

221
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,390
those things sound so distant to me.

222
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,080
That's why I didn't want to get married.

223
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,260
Because I don't have to feel
small when it's just me.

224
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,670
But I came across an opportunity.

225
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,430
That's why I made that decision.

226
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,540
A-Are you seriously...

227
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,430
blaming us because you weren't
born with a silver spoon?

228
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,670
That's not what I'm saying!

229
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,040
What's the difference, exactly?

230
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,430
Fine. How impressive you are.

231
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,950
Because you wanted to pamper your kids,

232
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,750
you tried to marry for money and assets?

233
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,240
Yes. That's what I wanted.

234
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,690
I didn't want to live feeling small,

235
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,830
and I didn't want my children to feel small.

236
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,290
Not being able to give them what they want,

237
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,200
moving from one rental to another,

238
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,250
worrying about the children's
education costs and rent,

239
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,440
and feeling anxious about
getting fired. I didn't want that.

240
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,940
That's the same thing.

241
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,450
You're blaming me right now.

242
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,210
I'm not blaming. That's just how I lived.

243
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,920
Yes.

244
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,770
I know you did the best you could.

245
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,360
With your meager salary,

246
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,860
you took care of sick Grandpa for 20 years and

247
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,810
Grandma's hospital and living
expenses due to dementia.

248
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:18,020
And you raised the three of us.
I know you went through a lot.

249
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,890
But I...

250
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,950
I didn't want to live like that.

251
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,920
That's how I felt.

252
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,340
So, please...

253
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,390
don't ask me why I don't live like you.

254
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,040
Because...

255
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,030
you don't understand my generation.

256
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,220
Like me? Like me?

257
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,010
Who told you to live like me?

258
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,890
If you didn't want to live like me,

259
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,500
you should've kept insisting on anti-marriage.

260
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,140
You shouldn't have sold yourself to money, then.

261
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,010
Honey, you're going too far.

262
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,860
No, I'm not.

263
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,570
Any other excuses?

264
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,340
Choice.

265
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,460
What?

266
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,100
My choice.

267
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,870
I greatly inconvenienced you
because things went wrong today.

268
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,170
I'm really sorry. I'm truly, truly sorry.

269
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,970
But...

270
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,050
if I get an opportunity like this again,

271
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,870
I'd make the same choice.

272
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,260
Lee Ji Hyeok,

273
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,460
how did you end up this way?

274
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,150
I don't think I raised you this way.

275
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,050
If you think you have lived correctly,

276
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,930
keep believing so.

277
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,070
Don't force your children to agree.

278
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,110
W-What did you say, you bastard?

279
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,470
We just have different values from your generation.

280
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,240
Since you aren't active in this generation,

281
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,710
you two would never...

282
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,170
understand my decision.

283
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,800
 You still insist you did the
right thing! You still insist! 

284
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,250
Is Hyung seriously out of his mind?

285
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,490
I understand his position.
That's the reality these days.

286
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,870
What?

287
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,120
I don't want to live desperately, either.

288
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,090
I want to live with dignity.

289
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,900
Doesn't everyone want to live the life others envy?

290
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,160
Hey, he's less than human to me.

291
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,400
I'm so disappointed.

292
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,480
Shouldn't we understand him?

293
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,740
Ji Hyeok is the victim right now.

294
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,530
What have you done for him
that you're disappointed?

295
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,060
Don't you remember when we were kids?

296
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,940
He gave us pocket money from his part-time job

297
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,750
and he still did after getting a job.

298
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,020
I don't want to side with him because of that.

299
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,020
He flipped the whole house upside down.

300
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,890
Do you have anything else to say?

301
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,880
What else could I say?
It'd only be a waste of breath.

302
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,720
Our impressive son put us in this situation,

303
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,420
but he has no regrets at all.

304
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,850
Ji Hyeok,

305
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,880
what are you planning to do from now on?

306
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,100
Looks like you quit your job, too.

307
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,030
I'll be away for a while, Mom.

308
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,700
Of course, you should be.

309
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Were you going to live here after what you've done?

310
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,300
- Don't you have any shame?
- Honey.

311
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,640
I was going to kick you out
even if you wanted to stay.

312
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,470
I'll go inside now.

313
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,440
Grandma, let's go to your room.

314
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,450
 Get out now! 

315
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,480
Ji Hyeok, you can't leave after saying all that.

316
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,220
What was I supposed to say, then?

317
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,140
Is there a clear answer in this situation?

318
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,900
You mean, asking for forgiveness?

319
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,020
Of course, you should.

320
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,300
I apologized.

321
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,090
Because I felt bad that they were humiliated.

322
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,140
That's all I can say.

323
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,750
I can't say I did the wrong thing.

324
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,500
You got humiliated after trying
to marry for money.

325
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,040
You can't say you're sorry?

326
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,890
I'll get changed. Please leave.

327
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,610
Hyung!

328
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,250
Get out, I said.

329
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,870
Let's go.

330
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,400
Mom, Dad, Ji Hyeok packed his stuff and left.

331
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,200
It's obvious. You didn't have to tell me.
I told him to leave.

332
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,820
Mom, is Dad going to bring Ji Hyeok back?

333
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,430
Hello.

334
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,720
 If you think you have lived correctly, 

335
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,510
 keep believing so. 

336
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,560
 Don't force your children to agree. 

337
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,260
 I want to live a comfortable life. 

338
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,260
Earliest ride to anywhere, please.

339
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,930
 It feels wrong to know. 

340
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,810
 There's a club afterparty. 

341
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,590
 The sunbaes from way back
invited all of their hoobaes. 

342
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,080
 - I'm happy.
- He's laughing. 

343
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,840
She's really something, Ji Eun Oh.

344
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,030
She won't drink a drop of alcohol.

345
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,500
You're the best. The best.

346
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,330
We, the old ones, should leave quietly.

347
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,160
- Yes, we drank enough. Let's go.
- Let's go.

348
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,450
Are you leaving?

349
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,890
No, no. Sit down.

350
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,710
Are you leaving?

351
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,940
- Take care.
- Bye.

352
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,170
Bye.

353
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,760
Take care.

354
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,570
Okay, let's wrap things up.

355
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,400
Hey, we have alcohol left.

356
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,780
It's getting late.

357
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,160
Let's just hear from Eun Oh and leave.

358
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,750
- Yes, yes.
- Ji Eun Oh, come here.

359
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,800
Why?

360
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,790
Hey. Tell us Ji Hyeok's story.

361
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,870
You guys are close.

362
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,500
You know his phone number.

363
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,440
Ask him directly. You look cowardly.

364
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,890
What?

365
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,470
Have you not relieved your stress yet?

366
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,000
Looks like Lee Ji Hyeok got pulverized
and blown away like dust.

367
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,120
No, no. It's not because I don't like Ji Hyeok-

368
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,760
- Gosh. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- I could ask, you know...

369
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,440
Okay, let's go home.

370
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,320
Jun Yeong, Seong Ho, clean up now.

371
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,990
Sunbae, that's enough.

372
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,520
- My gosh!
- Sunbae, Sunbae,

373
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,230
should I give you Ji Hyeok's number?

374
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,900
Yes. Do you have it?

375
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,510
Why?

376
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,590
Come on.

377
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,030
- Imagine how hard it is for him.
- Stop, Sunbaenim.

378
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,160
I hope you understand, Eun Oh.

379
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,630
Bye.

380
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,900
That's enough.

381
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,800
I got it. Bye now.

382
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,150
We can't keep the door open all night.

383
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,650
What do we do with the smell?

384
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,420
What's this smell?

385
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,050
It's filled with a strange odor.

386
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,430
Director, what happened?

387
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,910
What brings you here?

388
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,680
I thought you'd be curious.

389
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,350
You must've been quite shocked, too.

390
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,340
I'm curious, but I don't want to know.

391
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,750
I'm dying to know.

392
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,940
We're cleaning. I think you should leave.

393
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,860
Hey, let's drink just the three of us.

394
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,270
You said you were thirsty.

395
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,950
Yes, Eun Oh. A light drink.

396
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,310
You two can drink.

397
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,770
I'm exhausted today.

398
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,270
What's wrong, Eun Oh?

399
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,000
Did I do something wrong to you, by chance?

400
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,200
No. I just don't want to hear anything
from Lee Ji Hyeok's friend.

401
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,860
Oh, really?

402
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,580
Su Jeong, the rest of the disinfectants
are in the storage, right?

403
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,400
I should wipe the tables again.

404
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:12,250
 I just don't want to hear anything
from Lee Ji Hyeok's friend. 

405
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,010
 

406
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,240
 

407
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,820
Hey, Lee Sang Cheol!

408
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,570
Why don't you answer my call?

409
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,950
I-Is that you?

410
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,090
Of course, it's me.

411
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,220
I searched the whole neighborhood.

412
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,420
I was going to come halfway up just to make sure

413
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,470
and saw the light up here. So, I called.

414
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,200
I-I'm sorry for making you worry.

415
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,720
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

416
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,240
Did you drink all this?

417
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,690
I guess I did.

418
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,050
Were you trying to kill yourself?

419
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,350
You're not a ghost, right?

420
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,870
You're Lee Sang Cheol and alive, right?

421
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,000
Honey.

422
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,530
Da Jeong,

423
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:04,020
I thought he'd say, "I'm sorry, Father."

424
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,660
I thought he'd say, "I wasn't thinking clearly."

425
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,170
He couldn't because he was embarrassed.

426
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:25,570
If he said "I'm sorry, Father,"

427
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,860
I was going to slap his back twice and hug him.

428
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,080
Why did he make such a mistake?

429
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,210
He must've felt so small.

430
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,820
He must've been struggling so much.

431
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,280
I was going to say stuff like that doesn't matter.

432
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,210
I was going to say it's nothing.

433
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,370
Bastard. What a bastard.

434
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,500
My goodness.

435
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,880
Are you crying?

436
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,120
Lee Sang Cheol is crying?

437
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,720
Don't cry, Honey.

438
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,690
I'll teach that bastard a thing or two.

439
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,840
What a jerk.

440
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,350
 

441
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,920
 

442
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,320
 

443
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,390
Is there a room?

444
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,680
How long will you stay?

445
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,330
Three days.

446
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,170
I woke up again today.

447
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,980
I ended up waking up again today.

448
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,300
Mother.

449
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,440
Starving for a few days won't kill me.

450
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,580
I don't want to eat.

451
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,820
Mother, you need to eat.

452
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,680
Could you eat for Sang Cheol's sake?

453
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:16,170
It's been three days,
but we haven't heard from him.

454
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:20,050
Don't worry if he's dead or alive.

455
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,930
He's the eldest son of the family.

456
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,130
You can't say such a thing,
no matter how angry you are.

457
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:32,140
Mother, Ji Wan is our eldest son starting today.

458
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,110
It never should've happened.

459
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,070
It's unacceptable.

460
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,000
But he left arrogantly.

461
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,030
I'll never let him in this house again.

462
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,960
So, you should relax, Mother.

463
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,080
Da Jeong and you guys should
get on with your lives, too.

464
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,050
Don't worry about something that's not worth it.

465
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,740
Let's eat, Mother.

466
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,970
 

467
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,360
Hello! Hello!

468
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,760
See? I was right.

469
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,660
I think it smells, too. That rotten bastard.

470
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,530
Open it now. Open it.

471
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,970
Aigoo!

472
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,510
God, Father, Buddha, and the divine spirit.

473
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,350
What's this about?

474
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,860
Gosh. My goodness. This man is totally fine.

475
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,930
You haven't eaten for two days and three nights.

476
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,880
I thought you committed suicide.

477
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,720
You can't do this at someone's business.

478
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,800
Suicide?

479
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,740
Look at him now.

480
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,890
See how dead his eyes look.

481
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,390
This is no good.

482
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,850
How could you not order a bowl of jjajangmyeon?

483
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,090
Get out now.

484
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,060
You just said two days and three nights.

485
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,980
Gosh. He doesn't know how many days it's been.

486
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,570
I'll refund you for a night. Leave.

487
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,840
I can't sleep because I'm too anxious.

488
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,510
 ♫ It's okay not to tell me ♫ 

489
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,320
 ♫ Lean on me and... ♫ 

490
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,190
 

491
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,260
 ♫ And you'll feel better ♫ 

492
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,270
 ♫ It's okay to rest sometimes ♫ 

493
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:51,300
 ♫ You've been working hard ♫ 

494
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,200
 ♫ It's okay to pause for a moment ♫ 

495
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:00,570
 ♫ A tiring day has passed ♫ 

496
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,430

00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:11,580
Is he possessed by a ghost who couldn't work?

498
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,530
He can't work tomorrow if he does that.

499
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,730
Hey, young man.

500
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,670

Your eyes are sunken.

507
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,140
What can I do today?

508
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,370

Yes.

He should rest a bit. Look at him.

523
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,670
 - He should rest.
- Why doesn't he rest? 

524
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,370
 What if he passes out? 

525
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,420
 He'll hurt himself. 

526
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,940
 Gosh, he must be exhausted. 

527
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,440
This fellow really doesn't talk.

528
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,300
We've seen each other for a few days.
Let me pour you makgeolli.

529
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,030
It's okay.

530
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,560
Hey, Mr. Lee.

531
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,680
A young fellow shouldn't keep a distance.

532
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,400
You're making it hard for your coworkers.

533
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,610
You don't have to speak. I know how you feel.

534
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,910
Aigoo, look at that...

535
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,940
- Gosh, Mr. Lee!
- Mr. Lee.

536
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,450
Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee!

537
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,750
Why does Ji Hyeok like this so much?

538
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,640
 

539
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,470
Hey, Ji Hyeok.

540
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,220
 Hello? 

541
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,760
 This is not Mr. Lee Ji Hyeok. 

542
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,910
He just fell asleep?

543
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,100
Yes.

544
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,430
We all thought he had a heart attack.

545
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,390
But he started snoring in the ambulance.

546
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:29,960
The doctor thinks he hasn't slept
for four or five days.

547
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,110
That's why he passed out after a cup of makgeolli.

548
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,010
Thank you for caring for him.

549
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,420
I called you because you were
the last one he called.

550
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,130
Thank you.

551
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,840
Anyway, tell him Mr. Song wants
to see him tomorrow.

552
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,210
Okay. Take care.

553
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,600
Okay.

554
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,200
Gosh, Ji Hyeok.

555
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,630
Open your eyes.

556
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,790
Would you want to if you were me?

557
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,320
You crazy bastard.

558
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,050
You should've kept your phone off, then.

559
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,190
I can't because I need to be available for work.

560
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,540
Let's go eat.

561
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,650
You finished the IV.

562
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,870
How much longer will you be here?

563
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,740
Do you expect me to answer?

564
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,000
If you get a call from a job you
applied to, you'll come back, right?

565
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,360
Why are you so skinny?

566
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,180
It's not fun eating alone.

567
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,310
Are you done?

568
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,180
Let's go, then.

569
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,520
I'm leaving, Ji Hyeok.

570
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,980
Okay.

571
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,290
I won't tell your family.

572
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,150
Of course not.

573
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,610
I can't bring myself to leave.

574
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,790
How long will you be here?

575
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,590
Do you know how worried your family is?

576
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,860
Hey, the damage is done.

577
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,080
Don't you know what happened doesn't
go away even if you stay here?

578
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,880
You should face it, no matter how hard it is.

579
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,370
And...

580
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,310
why do you torture yourself like this?

581
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:53,440
It's Jeong Bo Ah's fault. You're a victim.

582
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,560
That's enough.

583
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,400
I'll figure it out.

584
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,460
Ji Hyeok,

585
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,090
just come with me.

586
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,250
Let's go, Ji Hyeok.

587
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,630
Take care.

588
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,000
 That bastard is abandoning me. 

589
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,640
"He'll hide and come out when people get

590
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,850
sick of it and get a job somewhere."

591
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:56,960
 That's what you're thinking, Park Seong Jae. 

592
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,510
 

593
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,390
Park Seong Jae, you bastard!

594
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,590
 

595
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,130
Go to bed, Mom.

596
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,770
Sit.

597
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,460
What is it, Mom?

598
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,830
The wedding you went to a while ago.

599
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,960
Was it that sunbae's wedding?

600
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,980
What sunbae?

601
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,380
You know who I'm talking about.

602
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:00,580
Your one and only with the last name Lee.

603
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,680
Did I tell you it was Ji Hyeok's wedding?

604
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,270
Should I arrange a blind date for you?

605
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,140
- Blind date?
- Yes.

606
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,210
You know the bank behind our restaurant?

607
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:19,570
Three young men who work there are my regulars.

608
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,460
They look nice. They're easygoing and

609
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,010
they eat generous portions. They're great.

610
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,030
What are you talking about?

611
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:33,530
You think it's easy to get over
someone you liked for a long time?

612
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:38,300
It's easier to get over someone
with another person.

613
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,050
Mom, it's not like that.

614
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:47,710
It looks like you liked him for years.

615
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:50,530
If he still isn't yours by now,

616
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,320
he wasn't meant to be.

617
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,030
But since it's been so long,

618
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,860
you must be so heartbroken, my daughter.

619
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,770
Gosh, my goodness, look at you.

620
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,900
Stop. What's with you?

621
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,950
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

622
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:20,820
I know. It's because you can't move on.

623
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,670
But still.

624
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,350
I won't let you set me up.

625
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,130
Yeong Ra, you shouldn't be stubborn about this.

626
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,400
You don't know...

627
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,920
how scared I was.

628
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,010
Not just anyone can come into the VIP room.

629
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,440
So, I'll stay here until we hire a new driver.

630
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,960
I'm saying I'll drive you to the studio.

631
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,270
How will you protect me?

632
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,920
I said she should take my driver.

633
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,670
Honey. I said we can't do that.

634
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,960
I hate it when you don't keep
work and life separate.

635
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,250
You'd be ruining your image at work.

636
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,030
By using a company's driver for personal use.

637
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,160
As Yeong Ra said,

638
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,860
let's keep her here until we hire a new driver.

639
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,370
Well, that won't be so good.

640
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:25,130
She has already wasted a lot of time being here.

641
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:28,860
You can't take more time off because of the show.

642
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,650
I'll drive her around.

643
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,780
You'd be in danger, too.

644
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,850
He hurt Mr. Jeong on purpose.

645
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,900
He even tried to kidnap her.

646
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,290
Seong Jae.

647
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,980
I'm glad you're here, Seong Jae.

648
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,870
You decide, like wise Solomon, for us.

649
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,550
Solomon?

650
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,740
Yeong Ra needs to go back to the studio tomorrow.

651
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,690
I'm planning to take her there.

652
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,860
But Father wants us to use the company's driver

653
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,630
to protect our daughter.

654
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,160
Doesn't that sound wrong?

655
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,500
Have you not hired a driver yet?

656
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,810
I have candidates.

657
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,290
But I don't know if that stalker is one of them.

658
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,830
Gosh. Since it's so scary,

659
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,520
we want to do a thorough background check.

660
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,110
But so many of them have issues.

661
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:26,840
If so, I'll take care of her for now.

662
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,860
You will?

663
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,240
You must be busy with work, too.

664
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,640
There's no choice.

665
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,070
I'll ask around.

666
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,210
Thank you, Oppa.

667
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,300
What favor did you want to ask
in person rather than on the phone?

668
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,520
Did something happen to your parents?

669
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,780
No.

670
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,480
I want to ask a personal favor.

671
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,100
Gosh...

672
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,990
What is it, then?

673
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,190
Seong Jae, be on my YouTube show just once.

674
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,850
I'll blur your face. Please?

675
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:20,900
Hey, drink mine, too.

676
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,570
- Get home safely.
- No.

677
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,940
Don't leave without hearing me out.

678
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,500
Ask a favor of someone who
could actually oblige your request.

679
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,430
I hate stuff like that.

680
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,720
I want to make a video on boyfriend looks.

681
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,550
I don't know anyone better than you.

682
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,360
Boyfriend looks?

683
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,120
You're out of your mind, Su Bin.

684
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,470
You must have tons of 20-something men around you.

685
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,490
I chose you for a reason.

686
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,040
I refuse.

687
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,510
You're so cruel.

688
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,590
If you care about my parents,

689
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,050
you can't do this.

690
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,740
How could you?

691
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,850
How are your parents doing?

692
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,810
What do you think?

693
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:17,470
I need to work hard and restore my family.

694
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,300
Ji Hyeok disappeared.

695
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,710
Dad's job offer was canceled.

696
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,670
And Ji Wan is unemployed.

697
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,740
Why is he? Did Ji Wan quit his job?

698
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,160
Yes.

699
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,880
It's been a while.

700
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,340
But our parents don't know.

701
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,670
That's the kind of situation we're in, Oppa.

702
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,780
Just once.

703
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,280
 Hyung, how is it going? 

704
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,350
I heard you quit your job.

705
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,140
Meet me right now.

706
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,130
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

707
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,060
 

708
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,260
It's not bad.

709
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,060
It's not bad. Why are you discarding this?

710
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:42,410
Don't say stuff like that, Sunbae.

711
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,830
Yes, Ji Eun Oh.

712
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,930
You know your place well.

713
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:49,120
I was afraid you'd actually believe me.

714
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,570
Leave if you're going to tease me.

715
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,000
These will help you.

716
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:07,150
What is it?

717
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,140
 ♫ If we meet again, hello, hello, hello ♫ 

718
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,910
Sunbae.

719
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,090
I'm telling you to do better.

720
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:35,690
 ♫ If we meet again, hello, hello, hello ♫ 

721
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:42,390
 ♫ Goodbye to you, whom I've longed for ♫ 

722
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,240
No,

723
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,540
you'll do fine.

724
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,180
Nothing stops you once you set your mind to it.

725
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,180
This is a problem.

726
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,600
 

727
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,850
Excuse me. I heard you do interior design, too.

728
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,720
Oh, yes.

729
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,800
Do you do studio apartments?
How much will it cost?

730
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,910
Could you email me the plan and the budget?

731
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,700
I can't consult you right now.

732
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,990
- I'll give you my business card.
- Oh, no...

733
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,560
I'm not doing it right away. I was just curious.

734
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,670
Thank you.

735
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,580
Take care.

736
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,080
What's wrong?

737
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,340
I didn't notice it before,

738
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,330
but people barge in out of the blue these days.

739
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,920
It must be distracting.

740
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,240
What will our focus queen do?

741
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,410
I need to make the barrier taller.

742
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,480
Make it more like a partition.

743
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,310
Your problem was solved, then.

744
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,900
I'll go out to solve my problem.

745
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,360
You have a problem?

746
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,270
Yes, my hair.

747
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,190
I said I have a blind date.

748
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,550
I made a coloring appointment.

749
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,100
- What about me?
- What about you?

750
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,730
I want to go on a blind date, too.

751
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,220
Really?

752
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,950
Do you mean it?

753
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,180
I was waiting for you to bring it up first.

754
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,100
Oh Su Jeong, why won't you set me up on a date?

755
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,960
Hey, hey...

756
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,730
Ji Eun Oh, are you kidding?

757
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,200
What's going on? What came over you?

758
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,480
My mom.

759
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,400
 Nice. Let's take it as far as we can. 

760
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,660
Let's make a concrete plan.

761
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,550
I'll present about 17 of them on the list.

762
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:01,810
You filter the list.

763
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:04,450
Did you have that many male friends?

764
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,600
Come on.

765
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:10,440
I would've had more if I weren't
stuck at Agit because of you.

766
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,260
 It's easier to get over someone
with another person. 

767
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,470
Why filter? I'll meet all of them.

768
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,350
I'll meet two a week until the construction starts.

769
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,290
- Really?
- Yes.

770
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,240
What?

771
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,320
He looked just like Director Park.

772
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:36,470
What does he do when he's not
at the cafe? When he's bored?

773
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:41,010
Wow. It took you long enough to worry about him.

774
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,020
He got coffee before work,

775
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,280
hung out for an hour during lunch,

776
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,400
and came to read on Saturdays.

777
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,440
But he hasn't been back in weeks.

778
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,520
I feel guilty.

779
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,190
Sunbaenim, I'm curious about something.

780
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,130
 
Can I ask you a question?

781
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,160
Sure.

782
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,470
Why do you always say you're bored?

783
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,060
Because I don't have a girlfriend.

784
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:10,780
Sunbae, you're friendly, tall, and handsome.

785
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,680
How come you never have a girlfriend?

786
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,170
I'm not sure. Is it because I'm too nice?

787
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,990
Watch out.

788
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,590
Seong Jae was always bored ever since he was born.

789
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,740
Having no hobbies is his hobby. Here.

790
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,750
He's right. If you don't let me join you,

791
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,470
I'd be bored the entire summer
and go back to the US.

792
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:30,230
Watch out, Eun Oh.

793
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,340
Why do I feel sad?

794
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,570
Come by every day, then, Seong Jae.

795
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,680
Can I really come by every day?

796
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,230
Hey,

797
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,860
I was actually surprised by you.

798
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:49,190
Haven't you known Director
long enough to be friends?

799
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:52,590
Did you only consider him as Ji Hyeok's friend?

800
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,260
No. It's not like that.

801
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,140
Why did you ignore him like that, then?

802
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,400
Huh?

803
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,490
What?

804
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,500
Long time no see.

805
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,980
Hello.

806
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,720
 Hello. 

807
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,030
- You and you.
- Thank you.

808
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,560
Hey.

809
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,950
Hop in.

810
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:26,620
Come.

811
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,590
- Let's go!
- Hurry up.

812
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,750
- You were here, Director.
- Welcome.

813
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,100
- I thought three would be enough today.
- Okay.

814
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,740
Weeds took over the wall in the back.

815
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,630
 
You can just do weeding today.

816
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:55,450
Yes, yes.

817
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:58,590
Hello, Mr. Bear.

818
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,000
They're good workers.

819
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,610
Thank you in advance.

820
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:26,170
I'll just go.

821
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,290
What are you talking about?

822
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:32,030
You lined up for work.

823
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:34,390
How could you back out now?

824
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,500
My back hurts a bit.

825
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,040
Hey!

826
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,210
You know how to drive, right?

827
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,100
- Yes.
- Let me ask you a favor, then.

828
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,450
We're picking up sheets
of glass at a shop in Seoul,

829
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,430
but Mr. Kim injured his leg.

830
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,720
- Seoul?
- It's for the children.

831
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,590
Please do us a favor.

832
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:59,230
You're having an easy day today.

833
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,760
 Turn right toward Seoul in 100 meters. 

834
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,670
 

835
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,050
Come to the shop when I call.

836
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,500
Okay.

837
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,130
I'm all done.

838
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,160
Yes, I'll be back soon.

839
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:51,960
Really?

840
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,810
Good job.

841
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,190
Of course. Don't you know who I am?

842
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:04,590
It was right there as it was waiting for me.

843
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,330
Okay. I'll be back soon.

844
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,780
Hello.

845
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:07,020
 Of course. Don't you know who I am? 

846
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,430
 It was right there as it was waiting for me. 

847
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,520
Stupid bastard.

848
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,840
What? What did you say?

849
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,650
Pardon?

850
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,180
I injured my leg.

851
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,540
Yes. I know.

852
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,990
Why do you call me a stupid bastard?

853
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:31,060
Well, no.

854
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:36,010
I just thought of someone.

855
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,380
 If you get a call from a job you applied to, 

856
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,240
 you'll come back, right? 

857
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,620
Stupid bastard.

858
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,040
Hey, stop the car.

859
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,220
Stop the car, bastard!

860
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,560
- Stop it now!
- No!

861
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:26,670
What? What? What are you doing?

862
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,250
Get off.

863
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:32,210
What are you doing?

864
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:35,140
Do you know how many times
you called me a stupid bastard?

865
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,600
It was over 10 times. Yet you say
you weren't talking about me?

866
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,480
- I did?
- You crazy bastard.

867
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,850
I hate it.

868
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,900
Director.

869
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,350
Eun Oh...

870
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,000
How...

871
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:54,300
do you feel about me?

872
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:24,800
 ♫ Your bright presence shines in the dark night ♫ 

873
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:32,800
 ♫ As blindingly bright as the stars ♫ 

874
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:40,540
 ♫ After a long time passed ♫ 

875
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:52,800
 ♫ Warm breeze is blowing next to me ♫ 

876
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,660
 ♫ At the end of deep and cold darkness ♫ 

877
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,900
 ♫ I'm looking at you, my light ♫ 

878
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,630
 If I could work until my kids get married, 

879
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:06,990
 I can do anything. 

880
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:10,890
 I cleared two months since you asked me to. 

881
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,660
 You'll ask your mom about revealing your age? Why? 

882
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,240
 I've known you for nine years already. 

883
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,130
 I thought I was a friend or
at least an honorary sunbae. 

884
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,250
 Okay, Sunbaenim. 

885
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,480
 Get compensated. You'll get a lot. 

886
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,710
 Around 4 a.m. this morning,
at Yangsu Dam in Ori-si, 

887
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:28,570
 a body of a man in his early 30s was found... 

888
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:29,960
 I don't want to live like this. 

889
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,120
 I don't want to live like this. 

890
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,250
 No!
