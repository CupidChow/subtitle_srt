1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,790
 
 You're getting married? 

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,420
With whom?

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,800
I know. Who are you marrying, Ji Hyeok?

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,420
That's what I'm wondering.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,720
Be quiet, everyone.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,790
Let's listen to him.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,350
Have you been dating someone, then?

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,380
- Yes.
- Wait...

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,940
You had a woman to marry?

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,370
N-Not just someone you were dating?

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,550
Why did you say that last time, then?

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,940
You said you aren't dating anyone, like anyone,

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,150
or want to get married.

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,150
You said that when you said you'll move out.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,540
 I want to be independent now. 

16
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,100
 There's no woman I like. 

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,600
 I have no interest in getting married. 

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,820
I had a reason back then.

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,580
What reason?

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,110
Do you need to know
all the details of my dating life?

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,020
I'm not asking about your personal life.

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,950
This makes no sense.

23
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,240
Can't I even ask that as a parent?

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,670
Please just let it go.

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,590
You wanted me to marry.

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,920
Yes.

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,400
The situation from the past doesn't matter.

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,320
He wants to get married.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,620
But still, you suddenly want
an in-laws' gathering in two days?

30
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,750
Is your fiancée coming to meet us tomorrow, then?

31
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,810
Meet her at the in-laws' gathering.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,280
Ji Hyeok, what does her family do?

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,720
She isn't from a regular family, right?

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,630
They didn't approve you, but now they do, right?

35
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,780
Yes, that makes sense.

36
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,980
Ji Hyeok, is that it?

37
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,780
Is that true?

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,840
Did they disapprove of you?

39
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,130
Yes.

40
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,150
What does her family do?

41
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,050
She's the daughter of Haneul Construction.

42
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,670
She's an only daughter.

43
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,550
- Haneul Construction?
- Haneul Construction?

44
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,510
The company that built the

45
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,480
Haneul Apartments behind the subway station?

46
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,350
Yes, Mom.

47
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,460
Hold on, so...

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,680
They disapproved of you because their daughter is

49
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
the only daughter of Haneul Construction.

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,380
How did they end up approving?

51
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,230
No, first of all,

52
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,400
why haven't you told us that
you wanted to marry someone?

53
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,600
It's all in the past.

54
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,440
Why are you acting so strangely?

55
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,850
Why won't you tell us?

56
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,010
I need to know the context so I can approve or not.

57
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,440
I'm not asking for your approval.

58
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,990
I'm asking you a favor.

59
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,840
Please help me so I can marry her.

60
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,110
We can't even meet her in advance
because she's from a rich family?

61
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,020
Is that your idea or theirs?

62
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,300
You'll meet her at the in-laws' gathering.

63
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,640
I'll marry her, anyway.

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,430
Hey, Lee Ji Hyeok!

65
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,180
That's enough.

66
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,620
Your dad is shocked because it's too sudden.

67
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,940
Don't act irritable and go upstairs, Ji Hyeok.

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,870
I have nothing else to say.

69
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,840
It's exactly as I said.

70
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,040
Since when was he so committed to love?

71
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,350
Can you believe this?

72
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,180
Ji Hyeok always kept a distance from us. Always.

73
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,260
But still. How could he not show
his stress for their disapproval?

74
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,940
I'm going in.

75
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,540
Gosh, what a relief.

76
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,330
Dad is unemployed, but Ji Hyeok
will be a chaebol son-in-law.

77
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,670
Are they a semi-chaebol?

78
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,590
I could finally have some confidence.

79
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,430
 What a relief. 

80
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,660
 I can breathe since all the attention is on Ji Hyeok. 

81
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,900
When did he secretly fall in love
with Haneul Construction's daughter?

82
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,420
He seemed to be dating a woman
from a club until recently.

83
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,650
Did they break up before this?

84
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,770
Geez, what a devious bastard.

85
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,930
Our Ji Hyeok isn't devious.

86
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,670
He probably didn't want to talk
about how they disapproved of him.

87
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,170
In front of the whole family, even.

88
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,050
Gosh. He's my child,

89
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,790
but it's getting harder to figure him out.

90
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,790
No parent fully understands their adult children.

91
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,530
Especially sons.

92
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,720
But still, he can't suddenly announce that.

93
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,110
He should've told us before the
gathering was scheduled.

94
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,970
What does he think of us, anyway?

95
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,760
Is he just doing what the rich family wants to do?

96
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,930
Since they've decided to approve their marriage,

97
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,320
they must've wanted to move ahead.

98
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,050
I know.

99
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,690
Tell Ji Hyeok to come down here.

100
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,380
Do you want to ruin his chance at this marriage?

101
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,710
No one has the luxury to pick and choose these days.

102
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,790
But she hasn't even introduced herself...

103
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,740
You agreed to be happy if he brought anyone.

104
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,230
You acted cool then. What's the deal?

105
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,660
I feel offended. It's out of line, too.

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,420
Let's just play along quietly.

107
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,680
He must want to get it over with before

108
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,060
the in-laws change their minds.

109
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,110
If you don't like his fiancée at the gathering,

110
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,570
just blow the whole thing off.

111
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,180
Should I?

112
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,620
You aren't going to.

113
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,880
Your wife is right here.

114
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,810
That bastard. She'd better be as good as her mother.

115
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,680
I'll actually blow it off, then.

116
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,570
Where are you going?

117
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,690
I'm going for a walk.

118
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,700
I'll leave as soon as I'm done with this.

119
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,170
We need to boil the rags. All the rags.

120
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,680
Hey.

121
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
Today isn't a rag boiling day.

122
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,190
It's not a major cleaning day, either.

123
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,180
I didn't ask you to join me.

124
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,210
You expect me to leave you behind?

125
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,260
Did you come to argue about that?

126
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,370
Well...

127
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,720
I forgot to dust.

128
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,810
You had a crush on him for six years.

129
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,440
It's probably not easy to forget about him.

130
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,300
It's not like that.

131
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,730
I want to work with a fresh attitude.

132
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,230
I got a new job. First time in a while.

133
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,060
A big one for once.

134
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,780
I'll boil the rags.

135
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,930
She hasn't even signed the contract.

136
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,550
Fine. Don't think about anything at all. Whatever.

137
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,640
 

138
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,030
 

139
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,670
 Should I say an art and design space? 

140
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,830
 I was planning for a space like that. 

141
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,750
Is it a space for sponsorship programs?

142
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,850
Hey, don't prepare too much in advance.

143
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,380
90% of them got a quote and disappeared.

144
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,250
But I think she'll call me back.

145
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,510
I stupidly didn't ask how it'd be used.

146
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,910
Is it a gallery, shop, or a multi-purpose space?

147
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,380
By the way, Ji Hyeok really isn't coming by.

148
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,930
It's been over a week.

149
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,970
Is it because I yelled at him last time?

150
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,850
No. He must be busy.

151
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,660
We have a customer.

152
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,190
Answer this.

153
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,990
Welcome.
 

154
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,360
Hello, this is Ji Eun Oh.

155
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,020
Yes, it's okay.

156
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,700
What time and where should I meet you?

157
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,540
Okay, got it.

158
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,820
Okay.

159
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,240
Here.

160
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,890
Yes, thank you.

161
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,140
That's your outfit and...

162
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,480
There aren't good clothes for mom.

163
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,450
Gosh, he's rushing the gathering too much.

164
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,500
First impressions are important.

165
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,980
Tell Mom to pick her own outfit.

166
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,530
There's nothing to pick.

167
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,800
She has no formal clothes.

168
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,220
I have formal clothes.

169
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,240
This.

170
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,310
That's too drab.

171
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,460
Don't you have anything else?

172
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,610
No. This is for events.

173
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,280
Mother looks great in a hanbok.

174
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,700
Grandma and Mom, sit in the back.

175
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,290
Father, sit in the front.

176
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,690
You guys can drive with me.

177
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,400
Get in, Grandma.

178
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,670
Nice to meet you, Father.

179
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,740
I'm Jeong Bo Ah.

180
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,980
Y-Yes. Nice to meet you.

181
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,420
Nice to meet you, Grandmother and Mother.

182
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,990
I'm Jeong Bo Ah.

183
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,790
Gosh, you're Ji Hyeok's fiancée.

184
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,250
Nice to meet you.

185
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,650
She's pretty.

186
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,420
Bo Ah, here are my siblings.

187
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,530
Oh, Ji Wan and Su Bin.

188
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,580
Nice to meet you.

189
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,380
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

190
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,400
Let's go in.

191
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,800
Let's go.

192
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,500
 I'm so sorry that... 

193
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,190
we rushed the in-laws' gathering too much.

194
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,010
I feel embarrassed and bad to tell you this,

195
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,690
but we already scheduled the wedding.

196
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,090
I was told this was an auspicious day.

197
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,350
We couldn't ignore things like that
as businesspeople.

198
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,580
I'm very sorry.

199
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,680
When did you schedule the wedding for, then?

200
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,530
Well, it's two weeks from now.

201
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,390
They probably need at least
two months to get a place to live.

202
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,330
There's an apartment I got for Bo Ah.

203
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,770
They can use that as a starter home.

204
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,590
My wife already got everything for the house.

205
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,670
There's no need to get anything else.

206
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,830
I just hope you understand.

207
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,030
If so,

208
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,330
is there anything we should prepare?

209
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,550
There's nothing.

210
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,510
Ji Hyeok's workplace is one of our vendors.

211
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,930
I already knew he was an exceptional employee.

212
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,700
Since we're in similar fields,

213
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,100
he can help with our business.

214
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,450
I find him so dependable.

215
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,630
Help with your business?

216
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,070
As soon as he's back from the honeymoon,

217
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,700
he'll start as the director of the planning team.

218
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,770
After about six months,
he'll become the executive director.

219
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,510
I have to train him to take over my duties quickly.

220
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,610
I see.

221
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:48,000
This wedding and the in-laws'
gathering came out of nowhere for us.

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,510
We don't know what to say since we're so surprised.

223
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,200
Yes, I completely understand.

224
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,170
I feel bad about that, too.

225
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,560
For that reason, we'll prepare
everything on our end.

226
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,800
You just need to attend the wedding.

227
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,930
I was shocked earlier.

228
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,730
You didn't get angry at all.

229
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,410
Wasn't your pride hurt at all?

230
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,800
He must've liked that Bo Ah a lot

231
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,830
for him to say he'd remain
single forever if he can't marry her.

232
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,320
Why should my sense of pride matter?

233
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,710
Right?

234
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,850
Ji Hyeok must like her a lot.

235
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,750
I know.

236
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:57,530
He must be happy since he gets
to marry someone he likes so much.

237
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,740
I'll be right back.

238
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,880
You're going to a meeting.

239
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,070
Yes.

240
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,010
Sunbae, about last time-

241
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,740
Give me a bottle of beer.

242
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,220
Yes.

243
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,800
Hey, what does a bottle of beer mean?

244
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,540
A beer at midday means he wants to kill time.

245
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,820
He wants to kill time?

246
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,220
Is he dealing with a major complaint?

247
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,770
 She came back to her senses, thankfully. 

248
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,700
I'd like it to be about 100 pyeong,

249
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,030
but the foundation has its budget.

250
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,800
You told me on the way that

251
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,430
you want this to be a gallery, studio,
and a storefront, too.

252
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,030
Did you find renters by chance?

253
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,970
How many people will use the space?

254
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,970
Will it be a long-term studio or an open studio?

255
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,340
You're very hardworking, Ms. Ji.

256
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,460
It's better to look at the space
with the client's plan in mind.

257
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,810
We're accepting applicants,

258
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,450
but the foundation will choose
the ones who need it more.

259
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,670
It'd be nice to have a mix of disciplines.

260
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,800
I'd like you to decide that for me.

261
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,210
It wouldn't be fun if they were all painters.

262
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,730
What am I deciding?

263
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,930
I'd like various types of young artists to be here.

264
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,820
Oil painting, watercolor, sculpture,
and installation art.

265
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,370
Oh, design, too.

266
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,180
Since you're a young interior designer.

267
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Looks like you want this to be a very unique space.

268
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,400
That's the plan for now.

269
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,880
Although I'm not sure if it'd happen.

270
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,530
It sounds cool.

271
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,700
A sponsored studio for young artists.

272
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,970
Should we discuss the details over a meal?

273
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,320
Yes.

274
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,550
Warm water for me, please.

275
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,090
Okay.

276
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,430
Before I forget...

277
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,000
Here. The key to the space.

278
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,420
Pardon?

279
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,990
We haven't signed the contract yet.

280
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,380
This is the contract.

281
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,390
We should sign the contract
after the budget gets determined-

282
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,630
May 1st, 2025.

283
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,830
5:50 p.m.

284
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,370
At Posetta Restaurant.

285
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,670
I, Ko Seong Hui, am hiring
CEO Ji Eun Oh of Eunoh-ism

286
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,430
to design the interior of the
80-pyeong commercial space

287
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,440
on the second floor of 48-4, Yeonnam-dong.

288
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,730
The total budget is 200 million won.

289
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,500
A space where two people can sleep.

290
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,970
A simple break room.

291
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,980
Men's and women's restrooms.

292
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,240
I'd like a sofa set in the lounge room, too.

293
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,520
That's what I want.

294
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,740
It'd be nice if they could sell their
pieces as they create in that space.

295
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,550
That's all I have in mind for now.

296
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,350
I want you to think about how to materialize that.

297
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,570
Okay, got it.

298
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,180
As for the construction period...

299
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,640
So, when are you planning to open?

300
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,010
How much should I pay you for designing?

301
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:47,100
It's usually set at 7% of the total cost
aside as the company's profit.

302
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,260
That's nonsense.

303
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,240
I expect an impressive and refreshing design.

304
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,020
Figure out the company's profit yourself.

305
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,570
How about 30 million for the design?

306
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,740
Thirty million won?

307
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,940
 Mom! 

308
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,040
They said they'll pay the premium for the shop.

309
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,690
Selling it like that is also business.

310
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,220
Your sister got us this shop
by saving for four years.

311
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,470
It was for my retirement and
for you to learn the ropes.

312
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,610
I'll increase it by several times more.

313
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,800
With what?

314
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,610
Stock? Crypto?

315
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,130
Yes. That's right. You know it, too.

316
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,640
You used to invest in crypto.

317
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,330
When the value dropped,
you freaked out and sold at a loss.

318
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,570
When it went up, you got provoked
and bought it with debt.

319
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,860
That's not all.

320
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,250
He bought what the stock analysis site recommended.

321
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,120
When it went up, he sold
immediately and bought a car.

322
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,330
And he sold it for nothing when he ran out of money.

323
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,900
Anyway, just ignore whatever this bastard says.

324
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,370
Let it go out the other ear.

325
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,880
- Hey, Ji Eun Oh.
- I'll stop giving you allowance

326
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,720
if you keep calling me by name.

327
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,170
What allowance? You don't even pay my wage fully.

328
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,950
How much of your debt have I paid?

329
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,530
Noona, a realtor came earlier.
Someone wants to move in here.

330
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,070
But they're willing to pay 30 million in premiums.

331
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,320
Gosh, 30 million?

332
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,560
Yes, 30 million.

333
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,280
How strange. I'm about to make 30 million, too.

334
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,760
What do you mean?

335
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,330
Mom, Mom. I was hired for
a 200-million-won project today.

336
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,880
And I get paid 30 million as a designer.

337
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,990
Gosh. Who's spending that much on interior design?

338
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,350
Someone rich. She's nice on top of that.

339
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,580
- My goodness.
- Who's that?

340
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,010
You won't know. She's my lifesaver.

341
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,340
So, I'm full of energy today.

342
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,270
- You should rest now.
- What?

343
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,300
Kang Oh, you clean up the tables.

344
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,570
I'll do the rest of the dishes.

345
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,200
Sit here, ma'am.

346
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,630
You must be tired, too.

347
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,160
Ji Kang Oh.

348
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,250
Noona,

349
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,070
what will you do with that money?

350
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,950
I'll pay off my debt and buy a car.

351
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,710
 

352
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,240
Hey, Ji Hyeok.

353
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,480
 Let's have lunch together today. 

354
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,300
Why all of a sudden?

355
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,570
This is something serious, isn't it?

356
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,900
You bought me a light meal.

357
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,420
I'm getting married two weeks from now.

358
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,940
Getting married?

359
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,810
I told you.

360
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,750
It's Haneul Construction's Jeong Bo Ah.

361
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,220
 

362
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,060
I didn't think you would.

363
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,720
I told you that day.

364
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,680
That I think I could get married.

365
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,080
 Listening to you, 

366
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,900
 I think I can do this. 

367
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,990
 Yes. I can do it. 

368
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,920
I thought you were bluffing.

369
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,460
Why would I bluff with you?

370
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,150
It's a major decision. Why?

371
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,820
Ji Hyeok,

372
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,580
won't you regret it?

373
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,980
I guess I'll find out.

374
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,000
Okay.

375
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,220
You even have a wedding invitation.

376
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,170
I didn't think you'd have a contractual marriage.

377
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,680
Watch what you say.

378
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,660
She's a good person.

379
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,440
She hasn't changed over time.

380
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,340
She's easygoing and not difficult.

381
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,770
She's not a high-maintenance rich girl.

382
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,910
She gets along with her elders, too.

383
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,510
But you don't love each other.

384
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,140
You don't love her, and she doesn't love you.

385
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,190
I wanted to give you the invitation.

386
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,170
Let's eat now that I gave it to you.

387
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,930
 

388
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,660
 

389
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,980
 

390
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,600
 

391
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,440
 

392
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,640
She actually sent it.

393
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,400
- Su Jeong.
- Eun Oh.

394
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Did you see this?

395
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,970
I was busy. What is it?

396
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,300
Ji Hyeok is getting married.

397
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,900
What are you talking about?

398
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,430
 

399
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,180
 

400
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,460
 

401
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,660
 

402
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,570
What's this?

403
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,970
 Lee Ji Hyeok's wedding prep committee? 

404
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,240
 It's because we can't discuss it in the group chat. 

405
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,870
 If you know, give us an answer. 

406
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,940
 Is she the Jeong Bo Ah from Haneul Construction? 

407
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,060
 Bingo. 

408
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,670
 When did Ji Hyeok date Jeong Bo Ah? 

409
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,350
 Isn't she the one who had an intense love affair 

410
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,160
 with a welder from Edel Orphanage
during volunteer work? 

411
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,430
 From Yumyeong University? 

412
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,490
 Right. Everyone knew about it. 

413
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,480
 A chaebol's daughter and an orphan's love affair. 

414
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,270
 And her family's disapproval. 

415
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,610
 I heard that's why they broke up. 

416
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,200
 Anyway, I know she didn't date Ji Hyeok. 

417
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,250
 He had a girlfriend from
the cycling club a month ago. 

418
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,780
 He's not a two-timer. 

419
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,450
 Why are they getting married? Is it contractual? 

420
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,340
 Ji Hyeok was anti-marriage. 

421
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,510
What on earth is going on?

422
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,270
 Announcing a party to celebrate
Lee Ji Hyeok's wedding. 

423
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,720
 After the wedding, at Cafe Agit, 

424
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,580
 Hangyeol Value's former and current members 

425
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,980
 will throw him an afterparty. 

426
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,620
He must be actually getting married.

427
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,540
 

428
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,280
Ji Eun Oh is calling me for the first time.

429
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,550
 

430
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,120
Hello?

431
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,730
 Director Park, I need to see you. 

432
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,140
Is it true that Ji Hyeok is marrying
Jeong Bo Ah from Haneul Construction?

433
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,100
I guess something has been going on between them.

434
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,550
That can't be. Nothing happened.

435
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,110
I know.

436
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,160
It's a strange situation.

437
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,080
Did he tell you in person?

438
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,010
I received the wedding invitation.

439
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,890
Well, Eun Oh...

440
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,800
This was it.

441
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,580
 You and I... 

442
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,070
 aren't compatible. 

443
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,620
I know what he meant now.

444
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,680
Can you help me understand, Eun Oh?

445
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,180
 When people can't be direct, 

446
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,690
 they beat around the bush. 

447
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,890
 Didn't you notice? 

448
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,540
 People usually... 

449
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,030
 find someone who's below
their standards incompatible with them. 

450
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,840
 Ji Hyeok will be their only son-in-law. 

451
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,820
 Why would Haneul Construction
want him as their only son-in-law? 

452
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,600
 Jeong Bo Ah is a damaged good. 

453
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,210
 She can't marry someone from high society anymore. 

454
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,690
 You and I... 

455
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,780
 aren't compatible. 

456
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,210
 Why are you anti-marriage, by the way? 

457
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,160
 Because I don't want to get married. 

458
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,240
Why don't you want to get married?

459
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,240
I just want to live freely.

460
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,510
Even if you meet someone you really like?

461
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,910
Even if you meet someone you truly, truly love?

462
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,510
I still won't get married.

463
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,730
Someone pretty, educated,

464
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,050
nice, and rich...

465
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,040
says she likes you. Even then?

466
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,160
Would someone like that choose me?

467
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,200
That'd be perfect.

468
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,830
What do you mean, perfect?

469
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,800
Perfect for marriage.

470
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,380
- Pardon?
- No one like that would choose me, man.

471
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,900
Hey, did Director Park know, too?

472
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,610
He received a wedding invitation.

473
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,540
Hey, why are you shaking your hands?

474
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,060
Hold me, Su Jeong.

475
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,860
Why did you have to like Lee Ji Hyeok?

476
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,400
You didn't even know his true colors, did you?

477
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,910
You told me several times

478
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,750
that he has something only you know.

479
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,640
You said he has something unique that you like.

480
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,450
Yes.

481
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,280
He did.

482
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,680
 

483
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,900
Where did he go?

484
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,060
Hey, have you seen Ji Hyeok?

485
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,810
No. I haven't seen him today,
yesterday, or the day before.

486
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,050
I won't see him tomorrow
or the day after. Stop asking.

487
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,500
You think I want to ask you?

488
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,490
I need the president's seal.

489
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,730
I guess you don't want
an overnight trip to a pension.

490
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,250
The pension Hyeon Su built, you mean?

491
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,070
Yup.

492
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,110
We have to go. We have to.

493
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,150
I want to go, too.

494
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:46,130
That's what I'm saying.
Find Ji Hyeok by tonight, okay?

495
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,210
Or get Oh Yeong Shik instead.

496
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,240
Let's see... I need to go to the restroom.

497
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,170
Hey, Oh Yeong Shik!

498
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,430
You bastard.

499
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,410
I know you went on a trip
with Ji Hyeok four days ago

500
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,220
to survey volunteer job sites in Samin-dong, right?

501
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,700
We did, and we parted ways.

502
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,800
What time and exactly where did you part?

503
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,960
Huh?

504
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,290
Did you kill him by chance?

505
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,210
Hey, hey.

506
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,750
Unless you killed and buried him in an empty lot,

507
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,660
you'd better tell the truth.

508
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,510
Ji Hyeok told me not to tell you.

509
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,060
Why? Is he living with someone or something?

510
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,320
Yes.

511
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,120
- What?
- I said, yes.

512
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,370
He is living with someone.

513
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,710
What do you mean, he's living with someone?

514
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,590
Oh, my gosh!

515
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,220
 I said they'll move out once they find a place! 

516
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,270
 Don't lay a finger on them until then. 

517
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,720
You'd better not!

518
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,160
Your faces will be all over the internet, then.

519
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,780
Hey, take that away.

520
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,030
You'll take this away?

521
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,700
You think this is the only camera that's filming you?

522
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,660
You think you could demolish the building illegally?

523
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,180
That camera even captures your pores and blemishes.

524
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,470
Come in. Come in.

525
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,750
Go ahead and make a slight scratch on this house.

526
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,070
You bastard...

527
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,190
Do you want to kill me?

528
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,950
Go ahead. See if I die.

529
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,100
How dare you stop us? They aren't even your family!

530
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,770
I'm Lee Ji Hyeok, a senior
in the business department

531
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,120
at Hangyeol University.

532
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,630
If you understood,

533
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,700
you'd better not show up until they move.

534
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,870
When would that be, you bastard?

535
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,050
Give me your phone number.

536
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,450
I'll be in touch, you bastard.

537
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,510
This bastard...

538
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:15,000
 ♫ After a long time passed ♫ 

539
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:27,300
 ♫ Warm breeze is blowing next to me ♫ 

540
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:33,000
 ♫ At the end of deep darkness ♫ 

541
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 ♫ I'm looking at you, my light ♫ 

542
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:47,450
 ♫ Light up my heart like the warm spring sunshine ♫ 

543
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,850
 ♫ Under the quiet night sky ♫ 

544
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,900
 Eun Oh. 

545
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,750
What are you thinking about?

546
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,970
What do we do?

547
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,380
How could you ask for the retirement bank book?

548
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,090
I said I'll fill it up.

549
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,190
If we marry him off empty-handed,

550
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,230
they'd look down on us.

551
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,610
But if we give him the money,

552
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,790
how would we pay off our loan?

553
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,290
What about Ji Wan and Su Bin?

554
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,550
I said I'll make money and put it back, Da Jeong.

555
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,450
Don't you trust me?

556
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,380
Here's 20 million won.

557
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,000
Thank you.

558
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,610
Father.

559
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,740
Here.

560
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,970
What's this?

561
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,430
You should get her a wedding ring, at least.

562
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,940
We already have everything.

563
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,490
Hey, the ring represents a man's pride.

564
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,680
And your parents aren't beggars.

565
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,290
How much is in here?

566
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,850
It's 100 million won.

567
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,110
Okay, Father.

568
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,650
Use 10 million to buy clothes
and shoes for our family.

569
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,300
The rest is plenty.

570
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,010
Thank you.

571
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,730
It's really okay, Father.

572
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,030
 How could you let me hear
about your wedding in a group chat? 

573
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,160
 It's not your style. 

574
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,490
 Give me a wedding invitation in person. 

575
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,160
 I was going to give it to you at the cafe, you punk. 

576
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,810
 When will you come? 

577
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,590
 I'll come before you close. 

578
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,870
Su Jeong, let's close early today.

579
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,240
 

580
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,990
 

581
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,370
Su Jeong is gone.

582
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,240
What would you like?

583
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,500
I had a lot of coffee today.

584
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,220
Chamomile, maybe?

585
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,900
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

586
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,010
Is something going on with Su Jeong?

587
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,220
You closed early.

588
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,020
Give me your wedding invitation.

589
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,420
Okay.

590
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,340
 

591
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,400
"Groom Lee Ji Hyeok.

592
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,010
Bride Jeong Bo Ah."

593
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,700
So it says.

594
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,020
The bride is Jeong Bo Ah.

595
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,110
Yes. It worked out that way.

596
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,790
Haneul Construction's Jeong Bo Ah.

597
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,460
Was this it?

598
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,490
What are you talking about?

599
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,840
This was the reason why we weren't compatible.

600
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,360
Right?

601
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,260
Did what I said...

602
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,980
sound that way to you?

603
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,270
That's how you said it.

604
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:39,710
"You and I aren't compatible."

605
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,460
I didn't mean it like that.

606
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,880
Don't play with words.

607
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,890
That won't work anymore.

608
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,580
I already know you're a shitty person.

609
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,160
Don't deny it, so you can pretend
to be a good person now.

610
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,240
It's not like you.

611
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,920
No. This was Lee Ji Hyeok.

612
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,250
I didn't know. I had the wrong impression.

613
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,330
- Ji Eun Oh.
- I'm not criticizing you.

614
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:18,570
I just can't believe myself.

615
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,410
I...

616
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,010
I liked you as a person first.

617
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,930
I thought you were a very admirable person.

618
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,270
That's how I ended up liking you.

619
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,800
I thought you were someone admirable

620
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,280
who's worth liking. But...

621
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,340
this is too unexpected. All I can do is laugh.

622
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,570
That's enough.

623
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,070
I didn't ask you to find me admirable.

624
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,730
You shouldn't criticize me
for not meeting your expectations.

625
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,470
I'm not criticizing you. I'm just angry.

626
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,130
You could've just told me.

627
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:00,780
"Your status, background, and level

628
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,510
don't meet my criteria." That would've been simple.

629
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,170
"Ji Eun Oh, since you're too poor,

630
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,330
you don't meet my criteria.
So, don't even look at me."

631
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,140
If you were honest like that,
I would've understood easily.

632
00:41:23,337 --> 00:41:26,530
But until the end, you acted
like you were something.

633
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,760
"I don't have to share my thoughts.
You figure it out."

634
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,820
You gave me nonsensical, ridiculous excuses

635
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,550
and acted superior until the end.

636
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,240
What you wanted in the end

637
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,630
was getting comfortable, upgrading your status,

638
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,170
and getting rich without an ounce of love.

639
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,060
That was it.

640
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,670
But you acted as if it wasn't.

641
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,140
As if you care about the weak and justice.

642
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,440
As if you weren't getting married to live freely.

643
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,060
I'm angry that you've been deceiving me like that.

644
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,510
It makes me so angry. Terribly angry.

645
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,720
I see.

646
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,850
I realized my favorite person
was the kind I hate the most.

647
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:30,160
So, I'll forget about how I behaved, thinking

648
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,170
you were an admirable and good person,

649
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,730
and the disgusting behavior that
appeared to be out of friendship.

650
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,240
I'll forget about them.

651
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,850
Don't act like you know me from now on.

652
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,990
You're so cut and dry, Eun Oh.

653
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,120
You sorted everything out on your own.

654
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,330
Speak if you have something to say.

655
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:02,160
You might think you're being attacked for no reason.

656
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,710
Our relationship is over now.

657
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:11,090
We aren't sunbae, hoobae, or anything.

658
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,670
Got it?

659
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,130
Answer me.

660
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,000
Okay.

661
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,800
Leave now.

662
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,960
Leave!

663
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,480
Okay.

664
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,280
 Where did things go wrong? 

665
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,940
 Hey, Ji Hyeok. 

666
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,770
I'm at Agit.

667
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,590
Take care of Ji Eun Oh.

668
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,220
She's flipping out.

669
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:46,720
I have a proposal to write, but I'm stuck, Eun Oh.

670
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:10,630
I wanted to have just one beer.

671
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,850
Have a seat.

672
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,720
Thanks.

673
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,030
You must be very tired.

674
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,430
You aren't saying anything.

675
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,110
Do you not need someone to talk to

676
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,160
or do you not want to talk to me?

677
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,830
Both.

678
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,640
Should I leave now?

679
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,670
Drink the rest and leave.

680
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,250
She's acting like someone else.

681
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:32,490
Will artists like us no longer be needed, then?

682
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:38,540
Which part of this piece made you think it's art?

683
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,750
If we say we can create art using machines,

684
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:50,580
should machines also be considered
artists and not just people?

685
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:56,790
It's the humans that are moved by art.

686
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,520
Let's discuss this topic in the next class.

687
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,400
That's it for today. Thank you.

688
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,960
 - Thank you.
- Thank you. 

689
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,660
 Mr. Jeong will be in the car right
in front of the entrance. 

690
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,870
 Run, looking at your watch
as if you're in a hurry. 

691
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,420
Are you okay?

692
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,860
I think we should call an ambulance.

693
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,460
I think she's hurt badly.

694
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:41,840
She's injured?

695
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,560
How badly?

696
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,630
No, which hospital is she at?

697
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,410
She fainted out of shock.

698
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,180
She's thankfully not seriously injured.

699
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,700
What about her face? How bad is the wound?

700
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,860
It's a cut.

701
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,390
Will it leave a scar or not?

702
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,800
It's not that deep of a cut.

703
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,060
What about Mr. Jeong's surgery?

704
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,920
I heard he had a bad brain hemorrhage.

705
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,210
Thankfully, the students
called the ambulance quickly.

706
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,930
His life won't be in danger.

707
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,300
I see.

708
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,060
Mom.

709
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,760
Yes, Yeong Ra.

710
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,780
What happened?

711
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,870
I told you to be careful.

712
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,380
Honey, later.

713
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,730
Oh, okay. You should rest. Rest...

714
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:46,120
Hey. You came.

715
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,820
Yeong Ra, Seong Jae is here.

716
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,300
Yeong Ra, are you okay?

717
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,920
You must've been scared.

718
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,370
Yes, Oppa.

719
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,000
I was scared to death.

720
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,850
Where's the bastard? They haven't caught him yet?

721
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:11,970
No. He ran away on a motorcycle.

722
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,220
I guess they haven't caught him yet.

723
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,100
What do I do?

724
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,100
Aren't you sleeping?

725
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,570
I feel too weird.

726
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,050
I feel disappointed and tired.

727
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,480
Why? I feel relieved.

728
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:05,610
 ♫ Although I can't tell you... ♫ 

729
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,900
 ♫ that I love you ♫ 

730
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:19,570
 ♫ We still share the same feelings ♫ 

731
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,880
 ♫ We promised then ♫ 

732
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,170
 ♫ Saying I miss you ♫ 

733
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:39,360
 ♫ I say that inside my head hundreds of times ♫ 

734
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:49,530
 ♫ If we meet again, hello, hello, hello ♫ 

735
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:56,850
 ♫ The feeling of longing is seeping in everywhere ♫ 

736
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:04,090
 ♫ If we meet again, hello, hello, hello ♫ 

737
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:10,750
 ♫ Goodbye to you, whom I've longed for ♫ 

738
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,860
Whose wedding is it?

739
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,710
Why are you dressing up and getting your hair done?

740
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,130
It's a sunbae's wedding, I said.

741
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,920
You put more effort into your makeup than usual.

742
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,360
Did I?

743
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,460
Why did I?

744
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,470
I'll be right back.

745
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,010
Okay.

746
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,890
See you.

747
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:59,120
 I'm thinking of picking you up to save gas. 

748
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,120
 What do you think? 

749
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,730
 That's a good idea. 

750
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,560
What a relief.

751
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,120
I thought you'd be a groomsman, Director.

752
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,040
I had the wrong impression.

753
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,470
He asked his college friends, apparently.

754
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,740
I even got a car wash.

755
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,870
How disappointing.

756
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:50,040
That's why you came.

757
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,310
Yes, exactly.

758
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,220
Let's go, then.

759
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,450
 I'll take a photo now. 

760
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,080
One, two, three!

761
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,190
Nice.

762
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,440
Let me take another one.

763
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,600
Smile more. More.

764
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,860
One, two, three.

765
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,010
You're so pretty.

766
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,600
Yes, nice.

767
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,010
Let me take the last one.

768
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,030
One, two, three.

769
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:44,570
You're so generous, Eun Oh.

770
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,690
To go to the wedding of the man who rejected you.

771
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,410
I didn't think you'd go.

772
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,140
I'm going to sort things out for the last time.

773
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,970
I'm letting go of my long-time unrequited love.

774
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:05,470
I don't know how to respond
since you make it sound so easy.

775
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:09,150
It's hard to understand how you feel.

776
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,310
Right. When do you want to see a movie?

777
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,200
- A movie?
- We promised last time.

778
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,300
When you told me that
he broke up with his girlfriend.

779
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,940
What movie did you want to see?

780
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,320
Do you want to go tomorrow?

781
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,560
Well, that's too much.

782
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,890
What is?

783
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:37,360
Don't try to keep that promise now.

784
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,150
You're making me feel burdened.

785
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,520
You can't go to a movie theater alone.

786
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,820
That's why I agreed to come with you.

787
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:47,650
It was useless to tell you that info.

788
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,580
It's not useless.

789
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,000
I got to sort out my feelings.

790
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,640
I feel relieved.

791
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,460
I no longer need to linger foolishly.

792
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,240
It was so sudden...

793
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,310
- Gosh, hello.
- Congratulations.

794
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,190
Welcome. Welcome.

795
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,090
Cool suit, Sunbae.

796
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,160
It suits you well.

797
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,650
Congratulations, Ji Hyeok.

798
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,400
Thank you for coming, Eun Oh.

799
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,370
You, too, Seong Jae.

800
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,790
You look so different, all dressed up.

801
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,730
I'll enjoy the wedding.

802
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,850
Lee Ji Hyeok!

803
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,340
Wow, congrats.

804
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,130
- You look great.
- Congrats.

805
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,500
Hello, ma'am.

806
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,810
Thank you.

807
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,510
No, don't get up.

808
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,710
Thank you for coming.

809
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,390
Have a seat.

810
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:43,410
I'll go to the restroom.

811
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,480
Eun Oh!

812
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,010
Come on in.

813
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,470
Gosh, it's okay.

814
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:12,640
How have you been?

815
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,700
Could you help me?

816
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:17,730
Be careful.

817
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,840
Come on in.

818
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,480
Here comes the groom.

819
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,240
So handsome!

820
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,000
Congrats!

821
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,370
We welcomed the handsome groom.

822
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:23,040
Let's welcome the beautiful bride now.

823
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,570
I ask the guests to look up.

824
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,570
Here comes the bride.

825
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,340
She can't take too much time now.

826
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,940
She'll come. It's her wedding.

827
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,510
Why won't the bride come out?

828
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,530
Was she not notified?

829
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,350
The bride must be lazy.

830
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,380
She must've had to go to the bathroom.

831
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,610
The bride must be walking a bit slowly.

832
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,160
Please come out, Bride.

833
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,620
Please welcome the bride.

834
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,110
What's going on?

835
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:45,090
What's wrong, Ji Wan? What is it?

836
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,390
Huh?

837
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,250
It's nothing.

838
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:01,680
What?

839
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,240
What's this?

840
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,470
 I'm sorry. I'm going to him. 

841
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,090
Jeong Bo Ah is my sister-in-law.

842
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:15,740
She's going to "him"? What does that mean?

843
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,410
That's...

844
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:33,110
They'll do something on their end.

845
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,280
Just follow the lead. And...

846
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,940
Don't tell anyone about the text.

847
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,000
Okay, I-I won't.

848
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:46,790
Whoa, this is crazy.

849
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:54,680
Ji Hyeok,

850
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:57,690
come down.

851
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,580
Bo Ah isn't coming.

852
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:36,400
 ♫ It's okay not to tell me ♫ 

853
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,730
 ♫ Lean on me and close your eyes ♫ 

854
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:46,090
 ♫ And you'll feel better ♫ 

855
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,180
 ♫ It's okay to rest sometimes ♫ 

856
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:55,410
 ♫ You've been working hard ♫ 

857
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,610
 Are you out of your mind? 

858
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:59,050
 How could you try to marry for status? 

859
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,760
 If you really didn't want to live like me, 

860
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,600
 you shouldn't have let money control you. 

861
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,690
 So, the bride ran away? 

862
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:08,000
 Look at you now, Lee Ji Hyeok. 

863
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
 Haven't you known Director
long enough to be friends? 

864
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,800
 Eun Oh, I... 

865
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,200
 Ji Hyeok, how could you do this? 

866
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,800
 You're less than human to me. 

867
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,020
 - Hello!
- You can't do this. 

868
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,220
 That bastard ditched me. 

869
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,420
 Foolish bastard. 

870
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,960
 ♫ Those words from that day ♫
