1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,230
 
Let's become business partners.

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,850
You and I. The two of us.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,080
Do what?

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,240
I keep getting turnkey inquiries at Custom Homes.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,960
I already have about 10, maybe?

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,440
I thought maybe you could be in charge of those.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,020
- I don't want to.
- Listen to me first.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,660
Do the projects you want to work on
and only manage the turnkey ones.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,840
Share 5% of your projects with Custom Homes

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,170
and we can split the turnkey ones 3:7.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,300
Eunoh-ism will take 7.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,720
It's okay. I'm not interested.

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,550
You're not interested?

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,870
Do you mean you don't want to
partner with someone or just not me?

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,010
It's both.

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,760
I don't get it.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,970
You worked as a coordinator for me.

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,760
At the time, I was desperate enough
to want to kill someone for work.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,030
But not anymore? You don't want to make money now?

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,220
You should make money fast

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,460
so you can breathe and live your life.

22
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,430
This is why I don't want to.

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,870
You always cross the line.

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,230
I'll work alone even if I get one project a year.

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,730
Why should I do what I like with you?

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,940
We worked as partners once.

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,810
I don't get why you don't want
to keep working with me.

28
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,880
I'd give up if I understood why.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,540
 I just don't understand. 

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,990
 I don't get it. 

31
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,190
 I need to understand to resolve
the issue and learn the answer. 

32
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,680
I don't want to work with someone I do not trust.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,350
I just want us to be strangers.

34
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,360
You're still treating me
like I'm a stranger to you.

35
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,120
Eun Oh, if you take over the turnkey projects,

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,320
you can choose whatever project you want.

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,910
Eunoh-ism needs to grow, too.

38
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,010
I'm sure you could do it.

39
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,650
But it'd be hard for you to come
across fun projects until then.

40
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,770
You could make that happen sooner.
I don't know why you don't want it.

41
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,500
You can make a lot of money, too.

42
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,780
Aren't you the breadwinner?

43
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,080
Don't you want to buy a car? You need one.

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,560
Why waste an opportunity to make money?

45
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,090
Don't worry about my family.
Worry about yours instead.

46
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,640
You even received an investment.

47
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,120
When will you get a new office?

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,610
I'll manage myself. Don't worry.

49
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,520
Is that why you're considering
copying someone's design?

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,310
Hey, Lee Ji Hyeok!

51
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,980
You're over the top just because
you got the first investment.

52
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,710
You're very chatty now.

53
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,480
You'll become a chaebol in no time.

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,660
Lee Ji Hyeok? Ji Eun Oh.

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,760
So,

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,870
let's work on our own
without bothering each other.

57
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,030
You're so stubborn for no reason, too.

58
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,290
You know you're making zero sense right now.

59
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,670
There's something wrong with her brain structure.

60
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,540
Is it self-righteousness,
stubbornness, pride, or what?

61
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,140
She must've been so disappointed in me.

62
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,700
She's acting like a totally different person.

63
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,480
She makes me worry all the time.

64
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,020
So...

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,960
why are you debating for so long?

66
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,480
I'm going out for a movie today.

67
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,630
I was wondering what to wear.

68
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,730
With whom?

69
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,260
Huh?

70
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,100
Just a friend.

71
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,280
Hold on.

72
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,310
What's all this?

73
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,790
The clothes you used to wear to work before.

74
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,860
Wear these instead of Gang Oh's clothes.

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,950
You kept all these instead of throwing them away?

76
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,960
Come on. Why would I throw away
perfectly good clothes?

77
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,650
And you haven't gone out in a while.

78
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,130
The outfit helps you refresh your mood.

79
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,420
You're right.

80
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,650
I must've been dressing too casually
because of my job.

81
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,740
Should I switch things up a bit today, then?

82
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,530
How pretty.

83
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,750
I think you said something mean about me just now.

84
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,080
Me?

85
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,990
That can't be.

86
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,770
Are you opening the door for me
because I'm wearing this dress?

87
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,330
I've always opened it for you.

88
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,390
I said...

89
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,450
you looked pretty.

90
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,160
Gosh. Goosebumps.

91
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,450
Don't say stuff like that.

92
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,550
You shouldn't have worn that dress, then.

93
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,970
That's not right.

94
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,920
I haven't been asked out for a movie
and a meal in a while.

95
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,060
I should ask you out more often, then.

96
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,600
It's nice being a director.

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
You can go out on a weekday.

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,560
What are you talking about? I took a day off.

99
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,900
Get in.

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,730
 Keep your promise to go out
for a movie with me, then. 

101
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,400
 I agree. When's a good time? 

102
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,170
Since when did Eun Oh
feel so comfortable around him?

103
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,910
How did she get so comfortable?

104
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,850
 See you on Wednesday when the cafe is closed. 

105
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,750
They're going out for a movie today, huh?

106
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,230
When did they make that plan, exactly?

107
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,990
I can't believe it.

108
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,000
It's like I've been transported
to a different world.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,750
You know a parallel universe, right?

110
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,090
Another version of me is living
in another universe.

111
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,560
I feel the same way.

112
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,580
Can't believe I'm eating with you
at a place like this.

113
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,920
It's fascinating, right? I think so, too.

114
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,270
It's not bad, right?

115
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,670
Of course not.

116
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,350
I've never had fusion food like this.
It's delicious.

117
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,240
You're not answering my question.

118
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,610
Pardon?

119
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,930
Oh, nothing. Eat.

120
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,640
By the way, why did you suddenly
tell me to keep my promise?

121
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,990
It happened so long ago.

122
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,480
I'm a businessman.

123
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,770
I can't forget about what I'm owed.

124
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,860
Because my situation was exposed out of the blue,

125
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,050
I wasn't sure how to manage things.

126
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,870
Why would you try to do that?

127
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,650
Adults can understand anything.

128
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,660
Thank you for not asking any further.

129
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,000
"How do you feel? Are you okay?"

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,030
You are being discreet.

131
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,500
I know what it's like to want
to keep things discreet.

132
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
Huh?

133
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,150
You know, it's like this.

134
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,800
Someone once said that
there's something you just can't tell everyone.

135
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,460
I've never heard you say stuff like that.

136
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,950
You sound like you have a story to tell.

137
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,230
Everyone has a story to tell, they say.

138
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,170
Let's eat. The food is getting cold.

139
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,660
Gosh. I'm full now.

140
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,200
No, no. You need to eat all this.

141
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
We need to walk a bit to the next destination.

142
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,650
The weather is amazing.

143
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,690
You didn't notice the season changing?

144
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,070
You haven't been in the sun in a while, right?

145
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,050
You think I'm always at the job site all day?

146
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,230
Getting the sun on the way to work doesn't count.

147
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,370
You need to walk while enjoying it.

148
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,800
The last time I saw the leaves,
they were light green.

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,770
They look a lot darker now.

150
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,080
You're right.

151
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,090
Gosh, how nice.

152
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,150
Yay! I got it.

153
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,390
I think I'm really good.

154
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,760
Wow! I hit it!

155
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,850
Thank you.

156
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,090
It's so cute.

157
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,280
Thank you so much.

158
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,100
Thank you.

159
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,290
I find it more and more unbelievable.

160
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,030
Doesn't he know he can't do this?

161
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,960
Why is he making things
even more difficult for her?

162
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,520
I made it clear that he's not the one.

163
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,280
Hello. I'm here for the interview.

164
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,050
Yes, welcome. Have a seat.

165
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,150
 ♫ It's a little different ♫ 

166
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,390
 ♫ It keeps reminding me ♫ 

167
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:03,670
 ♫ I keep thinking of your smile ♫ 

168
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,560
Gosh. The breeze feels so nice.

169
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,750
 ♫ I'm curious how you feel ♫ 

170
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,830
 ♫ Be honest with me ♫ 

171
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,530
 Eun Oh is like bright and warm sunshine. 

172
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,160
 Her laughter sounds like refreshing wind. 

173
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,040
It sounds like you got your energy back.

174
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,970
Yes, I did.

175
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,890
I had a revelation.

176
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,290
That I should live a good life.

177
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,870
What do you mean by that?

178
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,030
I have a best friend.

179
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,890
I got things off my chest with him a few days ago.

180
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,840
Today, I got to see the sun, thanks to you.

181
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,030
I enjoyed the breeze and laughed a lot, too.

182
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,830
I had good food, too.

183
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,680
It's like I'm being told that life
is still worth living.

184
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,310
Is that so?

185
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,720
Things find their own places eventually, you know.

186
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,570
I know that, but you get consumed
by the pain in the moment.

187
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,340
You do it voluntarily.

188
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,250
Voluntarily?

189
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,620
On your own?

190
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,100
 ♫ I made it, say you love me, too ♫ 

191
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,990
I'll text you the result.

192
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,170
Okay. I'm in your care.

193
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,580
 ♫ Say something if you tell me to ♫ 

194
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,980
 ♫ I made it, say you love me, too ♫ 

195
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,930
 ♫ Tell me without hesitating ♫ 

196
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,130
Gosh. My eyes are about to pop out.

197
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,830
They hurt.

198
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,060
I guess I can eat cup ramen comfortably today.

199
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,000
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

200
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,420
Wow. Lee Ji Hyeok made it.

201
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,800
I got myself a beef-bone soup, too.

202
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,860
Gosh. That feels good.

203
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,440
 

204
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,160
"No content"?

205
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,110
Why would I hire someone without any content?

206
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,780
What's this? Naro?

207
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,950
He worked for Key Life?

208
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,330
Why would someone like him apply
to work for Custom Homes?

209
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,270
 This is Cha Cheol Min. 

210
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,960
Yes. I'm calling from Custom Homes.

211
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,820
- Are you sure you applied to work for us?
 - Yes. 

212
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,290
Why did you quit your job at Naro?

213
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,830
Did you cause trouble while working there?

214
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,910
 The company begged me not to quit. 

215
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,140
 You can call and ask them.
I applied of my own volition. 

216
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,880
 Hang up if you won't interview me. 

217
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,370
I'll interview you. Let's do it.

218
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,460
Thank you so much for today.

219
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,260
I had fun today.

220
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,610
Me, too.

221
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,220
Get back safely.

222
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,850
Okay. I'll go.

223
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,020
You're here.

224
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,240
You're done with the interviews, right?

225
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,570
I need to work, too.

226
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,630
She wants to work here after having fun?

227
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,420
What's with that dress?

228
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,710
She's dressed for a date.

229
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,430
I was going to drink both, but do you want one?

230
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,170
Thank you.

231
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,500
Where are you...

232
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,650
What? Why does she look happy?

233
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,870
Did she have fun with Seong Jae?

234
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,170
Didn't they go out for a movie?

235
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,170
Did they go to a theme park?

236
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,590
What is she, a kid?

237
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,560
Was it a date or something? What's the deal?

238
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,690
Welcome.

239
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,770
Manager.

240
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,830
Ahjussi.

241
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,100
Do you work here?

242
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,320
Well, yes.

243
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,960
Someone else used to work here at this hour.

244
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,220
Well, he quit because he was in an accident.

245
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,120
So, I work here since that happened.

246
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,080
Two or three days a week.

247
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,390
I see.

248
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,180
I'm a regular here.

249
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,090
- You are?
- Yes.

250
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,520
Since this store is in the back alley,

251
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,090
there are a few customers, and it's quiet around.

252
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,850
Is your office nearby?

253
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,890
Yes. Up there.

254
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,640
I'll be seeing you often.

255
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,720
You just want these, right?

256
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,060
Yes.

257
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,170
It's 1,200 won.

258
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,250
Okay.

259
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,880
Well, let me bag it for you.

260
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,340
No, it's okay. I might eat it on the way.

261
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,550
I see.

262
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,440
- See you.
- Okay. Take care.

263
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,620
Manager! Manager, hold on. Hold on.

264
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,200
- What is it?
- Here. Take this.

265
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,320
What's this?

266
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,430
I didn't have to pay for it.

267
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,830
It was about to be discarded.

268
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,530
Ahjussi, I know this wasn't about to be discarded.

269
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,540
Pardon?

270
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,620
It's not past midnight.

271
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,230
I've worked at a convenience store, too.

272
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,210
I see. The thing is...

273
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,650
You reminded me of my son, who left home.

274
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,860
Pardon?

275
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,650
Someone might give him something like this, too.

276
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,670
When he's tired and stressed.

277
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,840
That makes me want to accept it.

278
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,660
Thank you.

279
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,990
Gosh, why am I so nosy?

280
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,290
She's like a violet that was revived by the rain.

281
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,950
Yes, 10, including this person.

282
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,600
That's perfect.

283
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,530
 

284
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,130
Hey, Su Jeong.

285
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,300
 How was today? 

286
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,440
 You had an outing in about a year. 

287
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,580
It was fun.

288
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,080
 It really must've been. You sound happy. 

289
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,240
After talking to Wu Jin and the Director,

290
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,260
Gang Oh is just Gang Oh, and I'm his sister.

291
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,740
I realized nothing changes.

292
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,790
That's why I'll wait for Gang Oh to come back.

293
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,610
While living happily as Ji Eun Oh.

294
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,610
 It's quiet, by the way. Are you home? 

295
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,900
I'm at the cafe.

296
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,360
Before I start the copycat home,
I'll finish the plan for Director Ko first.

297
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,240
 Are you meeting her? Did you hear from her? 

298
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,980
No, not yet.

299
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,260
Since it'd take some time to select the artists,

300
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,270
she said I could just work on my projects.

301
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,760
But I don't know when I'll hear from her.

302
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,440
Yes. I'll go home soon.

303
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,370
I still get scared to walk around at night,

304
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,520
so I go home before the bus stops running.

305
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,530
I wear my dad's jacket and hat, too.

306
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,920
What? Is that Gang Oh?

307
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,320
Couldn't she say goodbye, at least?

308
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,730
I saved her life after all.

309
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,660
Yes. I saved her life. Why can't she work with me?

310
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,750
I came at the right time.

311
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,990
Huh? You said you had to work. You came so soon.

312
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,960
I did what I had to do.

313
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,090
How about the movie? Did you enjoy it?

314
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,420
Let me get changed first.

315
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,290
Let's clean up quickly.

316
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,540
Are you happy about something?

317
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,190
Why do you ask?

318
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,180
Do you want me to keep crying,
thinking about Gang Oh, too?

319
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,000
Gosh, no.

320
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,230
Mom,

321
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,130
I just...

322
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,920
will wait for Gang Oh.

323
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,900
They say time heals.

324
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,930
So, you should hang in there, too, Mom.

325
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,670
Because...

326
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,380
this is like a tunnel...

327
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,110
you have to pass through since I'm your daughter.

328
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,520
And what can he do?

329
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,540
He'll come back when he's tired.

330
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,490
Of course. He will.

331
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,630
So, Ms. Sun Hui,

332
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,630
don't look at me, looking so guilty.

333
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,920
Okay?

334
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,490
Okay, okay. Got it. Gosh.

335
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,380
I told you not to cry.

336
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,130
Thank you.

337
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,090
Why are there no customers today?

338
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,030
Hey, let's clean!

339
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,240
Everyone's leaving.

340
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,790
Of course, we are.

341
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,990
You said we were cleaning.

342
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,560
You'll be cleaning for us.

343
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,290
You should pay for the food and lodging, Gang Oh.

344
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,940
Hey, I work as a server here.

345
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,020
Who told you to?

346
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,970
Clean thoroughly.

347
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,360
Slimy bastards.

348
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,400
You think I'll clean this place?

349
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,020
What are you doing, Hyung?

350
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,040
When is your mom coming?

351
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,180
I can't sleep because it's too tight.

352
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,340
I'm Cha Cheol Min.

353
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,650
I thought the interview was in an hour.

354
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,550
I came early to have tea.

355
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,140
And I saw you, CEO.

356
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,000
How did you know I was the CEO?

357
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,970
I just had a feeling.

358
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,230
Is he a psychic?

359
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,340
Should we do the interview now, then?

360
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,450
Sure.

361
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,770
Okay.

362
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,540
Your education level and the companies
you worked for say you're qualified.

363
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,250
But I just have one question.

364
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,640
Why do you want to work for a small company?

365
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,000
Because I want to work quietly.

366
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,970
You saw our website, right?
It's basically just the landing page.

367
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,300
You need to expand it and manage
the bulletin board.

368
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,680
Yes.

369
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,390
The earlier you start, the better.
When can you start?

370
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
There are no shoe samples?

371
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,110
- They didn't keep a pair of each?
- No.

372
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:24,080
We still have
some older models in stock, apparently.

373
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,420
They didn't store them?

374
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,250
You'll have to do some work for me, then.

375
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,290
Please tell Deputy Kim from
the business support team to come.

376
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,380
You wanted to see me.

377
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,770
What's your intention?

378
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,900
What are you plotting?

379
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,620
You can't be enjoying work all of a sudden.

380
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,140
When you inherited the company from Grandfather,

381
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,450
did you do it because you thought it'd be fun?

382
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,900
What?

383
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,530
You told me you don't run a company for fun.

384
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,690
You said since I'm the oldest child
and the only son,

385
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,900
it was an unavoidable path for me.

386
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:42,570
That's why I'm trying to explore
that path properly.

387
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,250
I don't buy this excuse.

388
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,560
I won't become a tiger without teeth.

389
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,760
I'm happy to hear it,

390
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,150
but I don't believe people change overnight.

391
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,810
I'm sure you have a different reason.

392
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,690
But looks like you want
to find your place at the company.

393
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,640
At least, I'll wait and see.

394
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,760
I'll go back and finish what I was doing.

395
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,100
 
Happy birthday!

396
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,190
I'm here. I'm here. Ji Eun Oh's here.

397
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,180
I brought the cake I made myself.

398
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,040
Thank you so much.

399
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,610
I'm leaving.

400
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,120
You made it yourself?

401
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,100
Yes.

402
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,760
Hey, there's no point
in looking at it or trying it.

403
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,110
I don't think so.

404
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,690
Ta-da.
 

405
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,930
Wow, it's nice.

406
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,400
Sunbae, if you think it's tasty,
don't call me Spring, okay?

407
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,250
There's no way it's not tasty.

408
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,640
I know I don't look like it,

409
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,690
but I've made birthday cakes
for my parents since I was 10.

410
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,600
You're blabbering your mouth again, Spring.

411
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,150
Light the candles already.

412
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,130
Hurry up.

413
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:47,310
That's why I'm telling you to promise first.

414
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,600
That person... I mean,

415
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,920
what's he doing here?

416
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,580
What? What?

417
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,310
How do you know each other?

418
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,090
Do you know him?

419
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,560
Well, the thing is...

420
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,710
Well, I mean...

421
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,300
Right. I asked her for directions.

422
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,680
Right. You did, right?

423
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,670
I'm so forgetful.

424
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,990
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

425
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,740
 She was like sunshine. 

426
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,070
 She was like a refreshing breeze, too. 

427
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,580
 I had no idea she was in 

428
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,950
 such a depressing situation, then. 

429
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,620
 

430
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,350
Hello.

431
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,140
You were here already.

432
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,720
Since there are floorings on the second floor,

433
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,350
how about we check that out first

434
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,490
and look at the sinks downstairs afterward?

435
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,580
It's a good idea to choose the kitchen colors
based on the flooring.

436
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,770
Okay.

437
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,410
Come this way.

438
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,680
This place is huge.

439
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,490
I'm sorry.

440
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,370
Huh? What a coincidence.

441
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,580
Manager Ji Eun Oh?

442
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,820
He also has an office at the cafe.

443
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,400
Hello, I'm CEO Lee Ji Hyeok of Custom Homes.

444
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,610
Gosh. I heard about you from a blog.

445
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,420
Really? Thank you.

446
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,410
What brings you here?

447
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,430
I heard this showroom was nice.

448
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,960
You're a client from the Mapo Apartments, right?

449
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,590
- Do you know me?
- Of course.

450
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,110
I saw the schedule. You're browsing
kitchen fixtures and cabinets, right?

451
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,290
Would you mind if I joined you?

452
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,390
I can give you advice since I'm in the field, too.

453
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,670
Like your five-year-old son's
room furniture colors.

454
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,670
That won't be necessary.

455
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,870
Feel free to look around on your own.

456
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,810
Manager, if you're concerned about me, I'm okay.

457
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,710
I want to learn from you, Manager.

458
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,940
We should educate each other.

459
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,750
Here. Let's hop in.

460
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:53,780
This matches the bright and warm feeling you want.

461
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,480
You're right.

462
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,720
It's even nicer in person.

463
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,120
I'm glad I listened to you.

464
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,180
The HQ got the actual measurements.

465
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,380
You just need to choose
the counter material and color.

466
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,880
I mentioned you can adjust the sink height, right?

467
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,200
If it's for a tall man like me,

468
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,710
can you make it higher for me, too?

469
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,940
Many customers want
to customize things these days.

470
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,380
They can adjust the height to match
other fixtures at home as well.

471
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,680
That's nice.

472
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,030
How time flies.

473
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,120
Sorry, but I might be running late
to meet someone.

474
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,560
I'll get going now.

475
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,330
I'll come with-

476
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,900
Take care. See you again.

477
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,450
What are you doing?

478
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,050
Check out the rest of the second floor with me.

479
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,800
I actually want to ask you something.

480
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,790
You can ask the people who work here.

481
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,640
Look. I'll do interior design for 29 homes.

482
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,690
But I haven't looked into many material suppliers.

483
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,480
So, the coordinators
will recommend suppliers to me.

484
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,970
But the customers can check out everything here.

485
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,970
But I need to get to know them
to get a group discount or something.

486
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,920
- So-
- So, might as well show me around.

487
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,710
It'd be nice to hear your opinion.

488
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,730
The window sash I briefly saw was unique.

489
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,740
Hey, just show me around
instead of wasting time like this.

490
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,330
- Thirty minutes.
- Okay.

491
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,830
Let's go.

492
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,630
Look. Isn't this unusual?

493
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:48,500
They made the frame thinner
to highlight the view better.

494
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,300
You're right.

495
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,690
It opens up the view.

496
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,760
Were you that curious about this?

497
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,300
It separates your home from others.

498
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,470
You said the details make the difference.

499
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,350
My group clients would love it
if they heard about this window frame.

500
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,530
I'm thinking of asking for a group discount.
What do you think?

501
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,360
I already talked to the moving company.

502
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,030
I'll provide a discount to my clients by
making a deal with this place as a partner.

503
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,710
If I work with the same supplier,

504
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,350
we could also reduce customer complaints, right?

505
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,560
What?

506
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,070
You're talking way too much today.

507
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,830
Right? But I keep thinking of something.

508
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,990
I find this fun.

509
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,140
How much commission are you
getting from the moving company?

510
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,520
I agreed not to take any.

511
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,670
Don't you run a business to make money?

512
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,960
I should make money.

513
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
But it's not fun to make money alone.

514
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,500
Wouldn't it be good if the clients
benefit from me, too?

515
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,700
You don't want to go back with me,
but you can't say,

516
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,840
"Let's go our separate ways,"
because you received my help.

517
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,810
That's what you're thinking now, right?

518
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,330
How impressive.

519
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,230
I won't beg you to work with me.

520
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,500
So, drive with me.

521
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,800
Driving separately to the same place
would be too childish, wouldn't it, Manager Ji?

522
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,330
Did you have fun yesterday?

523
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,780
Yes.

524
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,220
You grew very close to Seong Jae.

525
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,010
Yes.

526
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,510
Since when? Since when did you
and Seong Jae become so close?

527
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,340
How? While talking crap about me?

528
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,450
Did he say anything specific to you, by chance?

529
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,440
Why do you keep staring?

530
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,600
Huh?

531
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,740
Huh?

532
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,490
Say it if you have something to say.

533
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,920
No. I have nothing to say.

534
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,950
Look ahead and focus on driving, then.

535
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,590
Okay.

536
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,200
Did you have fun with Seong Jae yesterday?

537
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,290
You asked that earlier.

538
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,660
Did I?

539
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,050
My memory was reset.

540
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,660
Let's see...

541
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,940
Oppa, didn't you see me?

542
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,700
I waited until the light went off in your office,
so I wouldn't disturb you.

543
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,030
What's this about now?

544
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,840
I'll drive you home.

545
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,160
Let's talk on the way. I'm so tired today.

546
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,500
Oppa, go on 10 dates with me.

547
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,950
I can't give up like this.

548
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,170
What?

549
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,310
Is there a reason why you can't?

550
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,320
And Oppa, you talk to Ji Hyeok, don't you?

551
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,200
He's in Seoul, right?

552
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,280
You can't tell on him if he's still away.

553
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,240
Let's talk.

554
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,510
Su Bin, you little.

555
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,150
How dare you set a trap for me?

556
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,210
Don't treat me like this.

557
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm not little. I'm a grown woman.

558
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,800
Not to me.

559
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
You're only nine years older.

560
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,680
Don't act like an old-timer,
like you're 19 years older.

561
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,070
Oppa, I'm 24 years old.

562
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,900
Why do you reject me without trying

563
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,200
just because I'm your friend's little sister
and a kid you've known?

564
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,000
You're serious, aren't you?

565
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,320
- Of course.
- Su Bin,

566
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,060
even if you aren't Ji Hyeok's sister

567
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,040
and I haven't known you since you were seven,

568
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,640
I don't think of you as a woman.

569
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,580
I won't in the future, either.

570
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,340
For what reason? Why are you so sure?

571
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,740
Don't you remember that I said I like someone?

572
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,040
If you've liked her for a long time,
you would've made a move.

573
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,430
Although it makes no sense,
you would've been rejected.

574
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,740
That's why you must've continued
to be in unrequited love.

575
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,900
And I don't consider your crush as my competition.

576
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,750
I forgot.

577
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,290
You've been stubborn since you were a kid.

578
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,730
You're right. But I don't hold grudges.

579
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,160
So, go on just 10 dates with me.

580
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,640
If my heart doesn't flutter for you after that,

581
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,400
I'll go back to normal.

582
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,940
As an oppa and a little sister.

583
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,220
You're forcing me to say this.

584
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,410
So stubborn.

585
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,030
Okay. Go ahead. Tell me, Oppa.

586
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,680
What is it?

587
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,650
Su Bin,

588
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,400
I've been married before.

589
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,340
What did you say?

590
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,050
I'm a divorcé.

591
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,530
Gosh, Oppa.

592
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,590
Ask Ji Hyeok later.

593
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,230
He was a witness to my wedding.

594
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,700
D-During my 9th-grade summer break?

595
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,120
When Ji Hyeok returned
from the US after seeing you,

596
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,290
he brought Soul and Body Works
products and Twizzlers for me.

597
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,380
Was it then?

598
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,890
None of my friends know.

599
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,130
It's a secret only Ji Hyeok knows about.

600
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,760
I'm sorry for shocking you,

601
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,470
but how do you feel now?

602
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,750
No. There's no place for a divorcé in my life.

603
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,610
Okay, Oppa.

604
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,230
Forget about it. I'll go.

605
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,030
I'll drive you.

606
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,770
No. I can go on my own.

607
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,690
I'll go. Bye.

608
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,660
What a goofball.

609
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,040
Is this how young people these days view marriage?

610
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,900
Gosh. Nothing ever works.

611
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,670
Why did he get married when he was my age?

612
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,680
He was so young.

613
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,210
 
 The things I've told you to memorize 

614
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,820
will definitely end up on the test.
Please memorize them.

615
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,510
Let me ask before we leave.

616
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,550
You signed up for the September
electrician's test, right?

617
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,670
 Yes. 

618
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,340
Who signed up?

619
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,470
The written test is coming up soon.

620
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,380
Make sure to look through your workbooks.

621
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,600
I'll upload the mock test on the website.

622
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,220
Download it and take it.

623
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,830
 - Okay. 
- See you next time.

624
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,160
 Thank you. 

625
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,590
Did you sign up?

626
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,290
- Yes.
- Gosh, you're so hasty.

627
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,760
I failed three times.

628
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,050
So?

629
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,070
Haven't you heard that this test is hard?

630
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,000
Let's just wait and see.

631
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,500
Where did Ji Hyeok's suitcase go?

632
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,720
Is Ji Wan using it?

633
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,690
Thank you for continuing to work as my bodyguard.

634
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,190
Why won't you say anything?

635
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,070
I'm trying to focus on my duty...

636
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,440
ma'am.

637
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,250
Your duty?

638
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,600
I would've quit if it were up to me,

639
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,830
but I can't quit after learning
how serious the situation is...

640
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,250
ma'am.

641
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,270
I'll keep working as your driver.

642
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,710
- You don't have to go that far-
- I will.

643
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,130
I'll go that far...

644
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,080
ma'am.

645
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,430
I'm sorry, Oppa.

646
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,250
Forget about what I said.

647
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,790
About being a driver and his lady.

648
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,020
Stay here.

649
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,400
Get off.

650
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,340
Let's go.

651
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,660
She was reading a zombie webtoon of all things?

652
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,760
Who's he? Is he a boyfriend?

653
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,330
Wow. He's handsome.

654
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,970
I'm a driver.

655
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,710
I said I'm a driver.

656
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,260
Isn't it silly for a graduate student
to have a bodyguard?

657
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,540
It's not silly.

658
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,170
There's a reason for it. Don't mock her.

659
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,880
Let's go, ma'am.

660
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,570
Hey, Yeong Ra.
What was that webtoon on your tablet?

661
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,020
I've never seen it before.

662
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,520
Did you touch my tablet? Without my permission

663
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,730
No, your shirt was sticking out.

664
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,710
I saw it while I was putting it back in.
It wasn't on purpose.

665
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,910
And I only saw the webtoon.

666
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,780
It was so fun that I came back to
my senses when I heard your school bell.

667
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,020
Pardon?

668
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,320
Yes, yes.

669
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,630
I'm sorry I touched your belongings.

670
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,550
But where did you get it from?

671
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,190
Is the webtoon artist your friend?

672
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,880
Is that why you have the file?

673
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,770
It hasn't been published yet, right?

674
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,510
What do you mean?

675
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,570
Well, that stuff you were reading.

676
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,730
"Take My Heart." That one.

677
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,240
Where can I find it?

678
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,710
I looked it up, but it didn't come up.

679
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,190
Let's get going.

680
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,870
Don't be so curious about it.

681
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,600
It's because I'm curious.

682
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,000
Hey, that stuff is amazing. It's so fun.

683
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,800
Pardon?

684
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,570
They go after the ones who haven't been bitten.

685
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:32,990
Will they cut their brains if they catch them?

686
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,570
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

687
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,310
You have the file.

688
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,580
You must have the next chapters.

689
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,640
Did you really think it was good?

690
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,920
I'm dying to find out what happens next.

691
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,940
There's nothing after that.

692
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,010
Why isn't there?

693
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,710
If your friend is a webtoon artist,
you can find out the story.

694
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,670
Or tell me the name of the artist.

695
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,640
Aren't we going to leave?

696
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,210
I need to get to the studio in time.

697
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,580
We aren't leaving unless you tell me the name.

698
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,770
Why would you keep stuff like that a secret?

699
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,530
The thing is...

700
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,240
it's my work.

701
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,730
What?

702
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,890
Oppa, you need to keep it a secret.

703
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,990
Is it really yours?

704
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,820
Wow. My goodness. How could this be...

705
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,720
You scared me.

706
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,840
Why would you get scared?

707
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,150
The light was on.

708
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,330
And my shoes were at the door.

709
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:00,740
I didn't notice that because
I was thinking about something.

710
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,350
Thinking about what?

711
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:05,880
Ji Hyeok's suitcase?

712
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,050
What?

713
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:11,350
You brought him the suitcase
with his clothes in it.

714
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,290
I-I did?

715
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,910
Ji Hyeok told me that.

716
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,120
Oh, did he call you?

717
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,200
I knew it was you.

718
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,630
Where's he?

719
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,520
Mom, Mom...

720
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,160
You tricked me just now, didn't you?

721
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,670
I said where's Ji Hyeok?

722
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:31,150
I don't know.

723
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,060
Lee Ji Wan.

724
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,740
I have no idea where he is.

725
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,050
And Mom, I understand how he feels so well.

726
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:43,000
I think we should give him some time.

727
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,700
Give him time for what?

728
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,100
Well... Gosh. You've got to be kidding me.

729
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,600
Why are you standing there?

730
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,890
Come in.

731
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,590
What's going on? Why do you look so serious?

732
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,510
Honey, don't be shocked and listen.

733
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,960
Ji Hyeok is apparently in Seoul.

734
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,570
He's running some business.

735
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,630
He's staying in a storage room.

736
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,390
So?

737
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,390
What do you mean, so?

738
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,960
We need to bring him back here.

739
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,870
Why should we? Is he a kid?

740
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:50,040
We should because he isn't a kid.

741
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,980
He's embarrassed. How could
he come home on his own?

742
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,230
Since we're his parents,
we should reach out first.

743
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,310
He must feel so humiliated.

744
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,070
He's doing just fine. Just leave him.

745
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,370
Doing just fine?

746
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,900
Why do you sound like that?

747
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,100
Did you know, Honey?

748
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,110
I saw him once.

749
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,560
You met him?

750
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,550
No. I happened to see him passing by.

751
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,820
He didn't see me.

752
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,480
My goodness.

753
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,220
You saw him, but you pretended like you didn't?

754
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,850
And you didn't tell me after that?

755
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,170
When you know how worried I am?

756
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,640
You should've brought him home if you saw him.

757
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,890
You saw your son, who had left home,
after so many months.

758
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,950
How could you pretend not to see him?
You're his father.

759
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,090
It's not that I didn't pretend not to see him.
I just couldn't talk to him.

760
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,700
Because he seemed to be doing so well.

761
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,330
What did you say?

762
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:45,490
So, don't bring him home even
if you know where he is.

763
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,910
 I don't want it. I don't want it. 

764
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,920
What's he saying?

765
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:00,000
Aigoo. Whatever.

766
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,410
Fold it like this.

767
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:10,770
And then fold it like this.

768
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:14,590
Do you mean what you just said?

769
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,110
You don't want him to come back home?

770
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,430
You really don't want him to?

771
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:22,090
You heard what I said.
Why do you keep asking again?

772
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,330
Because I can't understand.

773
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:28,130
We're angry and disappointed at him,
but he's still our son.

774
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,770
You might be able to,

775
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:34,180
but I can't forgive him. No, no.

776
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,260
I can't accept it.

777
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,600
"I want to have a marriage like this
because of you, Father."

778
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,740
"I want to be with a rich woman because of you."

779
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:44,120
He put nails in my heart like that

780
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,100
and he had no regrets about it.

781
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,070
I could never forget that.

782
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,800
He never said it was because of you.

783
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,960
What a bastard.

784
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,340
You and I thought he was living
in a student apartment,

785
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,750
living off of cup ramen and alcohol,
living totally dejected.

786
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:21,800
We couldn't sleep because we were so worried.

787
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,060
But he was doing just fine.

788
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,020
He was dressed nicely and smiling.

789
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,230
But why bring him back?

790
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:34,690
If he looked pathetic and drained,
I would've caught him there.

791
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:38,080
But I couldn't.

792
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:42,850
I was embarrassed to step forward and say hi.

793
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:45,700
How could I grab him while he was
walking by so proudly?

794
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,820
What was I supposed to say?

795
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,390
I heard he's running some kind of business.

796
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,270
Business? Gosh.

797
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,460
That's why he brightened up so much
over the last few months.

798
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,120
Fine. Tell him to forget about us, then.

799
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,570
He always wanted to live on his own.

800
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,440
He didn't want to live in this house.

801
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,400
Don't you remember?

802
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:14,600
He told Ji Wan he wants to become successful
and come back.

803
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,750
Tell him to forget about it.

804
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,290
So what if he becomes successful?

805
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:21,060
Did we ever ask him to make money for us?

806
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,730
What's so great about success?

807
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:25,020
That's what he wants.

808
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,430
Becoming successful and having money.

809
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:30,300
He thinks we'll be impressed if he brings money.

810
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,980
That's why he blamed me so much.

811
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,300
That's why he looked down on me so much.

812
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,680
I'll tell him to leave even if he comes back.

813
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,680
Mother could hear you. Lower your voice.

814
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,890
Geez!

815
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,730
What's with you?

816
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,020
I'll say hello to Mother and study upstairs.

817
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,940
I need to study for the test.

818
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,620
Ji Hyeok was smiling?

819
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,580
 Yes. 

820
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,340
Please arrive on time tomorrow.

821
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,040
Okay.

822
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,140
 

823
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,290
Yes, Director Ko.

824
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:19,110
Are you free today, Manager Ji? Around 8.

825
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,200
Today?

826
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,240
I didn't want you to wait longer
and I happened to be free today.

827
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,320
I'm thinking a brief meeting.

828
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,410
I'm free today.

829
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,090
What time and where should I meet you?

830
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:38,920
We've been meeting outside
to do research on the studio atmosphere.

831
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,730
Since we don't have much time today,

832
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,520
how about you come to my office?

833
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:49,260
Sounds good. I'll be at Gaon Foundation by 8.

834
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,770
- Mom.
- Eun Oh.

835
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:02,090
Give me some meat.

836
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:05,110
I have an hour since my meeting got postponed.

837
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:07,170
Sit here. I'll go get it real quick.

838
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,470
Hey.

839
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,840
The owner's daughter should set the table herself.

840
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,450
I'll do it.

841
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,300
- Thank you.
- Of course.

842
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,610
Thank you. Take care.

843
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,900
Eat more. What would you like more of?

844
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,890
No, I'm full. I need to go now.

845
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,950
By chance, are you Gang Oh's mother?

846
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,480
- I am.
- We're Gang Oh's high school classmates.

847
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,430
He told me you run a barbecue shop around here.

848
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:43,070
I remember seeing you when you came to school.

849
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,240
Really? My goodness.

850
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,230
Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

851
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:50,390
His mother owns a barbecue restaurant.

852
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:53,230
Why does he work at the dating bar?

853
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,850
Mom, I'm leaving. I'm late.

854
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,900
Okay, okay.

855
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,940
Dating bar?

856
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,260
Where's that?

857
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,050
It's called "Couples' Bar" near Hongdae.

858
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,070
And this.

859
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:13,590
Here you go.

860
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,650
You're so diligent, Manager Ji.

861
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,900
You could've been doing

862
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,590
rough sketches until I find the artist candidates.

863
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:31,600
You said two painters,
one stationary or houseware designer.

864
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,240
I was preparing two versions since you said that.

865
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,930
I know.

866
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,970
You're so far ahead already.

867
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:40,790
My goodness.

868
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:44,410
We pretty much decided
on a painter and an illustrator,

869
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:48,320
but one of them is being investigated
for drug addiction.

870
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,070
What can we do? We need to find new candidates.

871
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:56,600
I didn't know that was going on.

872
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,400
Life is so complicated, isn't it?

873
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,030
I love the layout,

874
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:08,140
but since we could have one painter
and another kind of artist.

875
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,860
Let's use this as the base.

876
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:14,770
We'll develop it once things
get sorted out on my end.

877
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:21,070
But you'll have to keep the studio space empty
in the meantime.

878
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:24,000
So, that's what you were worried about.

879
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,820
That's okay.

880
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:32,880
What's more important is to support
the artists who are worthy.

881
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:39,070
Okay. I'll stop working on the plan
until you call me

882
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,550
after everything has been confirmed on your end.

883
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:42,980
Okay.

884
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,300
Feel free to work on other projects.

885
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,150
All right.

886
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,890
Hold on, Manager Ji.

887
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,560
Please sit here and wait for a moment.

888
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,330
Here.

889
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,550
It's calming candy.

890
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,880
Calming candy?

891
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,600
I came up with that name myself.

892
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,490
I eat it when I feel down or sad
because of some old memories.

893
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:43,030
It lifts up your mood.

894
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,700
Okay.

895
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:50,400
This is no good. I can't take it anymore.

896
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,490
Just tell me everything, Ms. Ji.

897
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,520
Pardon?

898
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,660
The thing that was bothering you.
Has it not been resolved?

899
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,530
No, no, no.

900
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,040
It's different this time.

901
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,280
You're young. You shouldn't be so down.

902
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,590
You look bubbly on the outside,

903
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:12,110
but you seemed completely drained inside today.

904
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,340
I'm not.

905
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,330
I must've been a bit tired.

906
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:22,460
I'm sorry for making you worry.

907
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,050
Well, then.

908
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,390
Should I tell you...

909
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:31,920
my secret I've been hiding first?

910
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,850
I have a daughter whom I lost.

911
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,480
No one knows about her but me.

912
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,850
Isn't it tragic?

913
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,960
Can you imagine how I've lived all this time?

914
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,520
Director Ko.

915
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,270
But it's strange.

916
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:17,320
This is a huge secret, you know?

917
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,470
But why am I telling you about it?

918
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:26,360
Is it because you seemed so hollow today?

919
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,970
I...

920
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,700
don't know my birth parents.

921
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,420
But it doesn't matter to me.

922
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:57,240
But my brother learned that I was adopted.

923
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,980
He says he doesn't think of me as his family.

924
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:06,360
My goodness.

925
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:15,220
You must have been so scared about that.

926
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,550
I'm so afraid that he won't come back.

927
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,130
I'm worried about my mom, too.

928
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:30,790
I wonder if I really took what was his.

929
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:34,340
Before my father's business failed,

930
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,090
we were pretty well-off.

931
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,980
Did your parents make you feel like
you weren't a part of the family?

932
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,150
No. Not at all.

933
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,560
When I learned I was adopted,

934
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,560
I was curious about my birth parents,
but I never yearned for them.

935
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,420
Because my parents were still my parents.

936
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,610
You're so thoughtful.

937
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,990
I was raised with a lot of love.

938
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,070
You can wait, then.

939
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,230
The loving parents are
your brother's birth parents.

940
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:37,260
Your brother must have
a similar personality to yours.

941
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,080
You should wait for him.

942
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,420
I should, right?

943
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,440
 Welcome. Welcome to our bar. 

944
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:47,350
 It's called "Couples' Bar" near Hongdae. 

945
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,320
 You can't do this if you're my birth mom. 

946
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,900
 I'm sorry, Gang Oh. 

947
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,670
 Is it me or Ji Eun Oh? 

948
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,620
 It's Eun Oh. 

949
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,960
 My daughter. 

950
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:21,780
You wanted us to become business partners.

951
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,680
Is that offer still valid?

952
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,220
You're saying that this early?

953
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,580
I need to go to the job site in Mapo.

954
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,260
Eun Oh.

955
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,790
It's Manager Ji.

956
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,490
Yes, Manager Ji.

957
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,200
Are you here to say that you'll work with me?

958
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,030
At this hour?

959
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,820
Will you do it or not?

960
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,890
I will. Let's do it.

961
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,590
But I have conditions.

962
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:57,900
Three of them.

963
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,510
If you accept my conditions

964
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:04,490
and get the contract notarized,
we'll work together.

965
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,060
Notarized?

966
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:17,810
 ♫ The moonlight shone on me ♫ 

967
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:23,870
 ♫ When I looked up in the sky, you ♫ 

968
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:31,170
 ♫ You, it was you ♫ 

969
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:36,130
 ♫ I try to ignore you ♫ 

970
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:43,270
 ♫ But my heart is always filled with you ♫ 

971
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:49,430
 ♫ I think it's always been you ♫ 

972
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,890
 Aren't you going too far? What am I, a server? 

973
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:58,530
 I think you'll stay a server.
Your mom won't bring us money. 

974
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,360
 What did I hear just now? 

975
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,480
 Will this be your only webtoon? 

976
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,590
 Oppa. 

977
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,140
 They said I can't. 

978
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,620
 I'm not qualified. 

979
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,470
 You want to forge a document to meet a man. 

980
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,220
 Am I supposed to let you become a criminal? 

981
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,630
 I don't want gukbap. 

982
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:14,820
 I don't like gukbap.

 Why does Ji Hyeok speak to you formally? 

984
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,280
 He only treats you as a business partner. 

985
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,010
 What are you doing, Lee Ji Hyeok? 

986
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,060
 She's not even your hoobae anymore.
