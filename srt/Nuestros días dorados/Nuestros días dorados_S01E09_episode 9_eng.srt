1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,440
 
It's not that-

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,530
It is.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,150
You even know how to be so low.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,700
Fine. I got it.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,550
Do keep at it.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,600
Cut me some slack, Ji Eun Oh.

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,890
Cut you some slack?

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,650
I won't make you uncomfortable anymore.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,610
Of course not.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,950
What?

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,820
I'll quit.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,280
What?

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,450
I'll quit...

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,330
working as a manager here.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,680
You'll quit working here?

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,560
The monk should leave
if he doesn't like the temple.

17
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,710
Don't you feel bad for me?

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,080
Don't you have any conscience?

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,580
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,370
But I tried not to be.

21
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,800
Because I had to live.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,930
And you don't care if I die, huh?

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,580
Will you die?

24
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,860
If I...

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,200
share a space with you,

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,460
will you die, Ji Eun Oh?

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,230
Say nonsense like that to Hyeon Su instead.

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,730
Feel free to continue.

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,270
I'll die.

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,740
You think I didn't know that?

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,060
How much you hate, despise, and

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,860
look down on me.

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,350
You think I didn't know?

34
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,660
And...

35
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,240
I'm incredibly ashamed,

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,720
embarrassed,

37
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,040
and humiliated.

38
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,410
But I still came here.

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,100
Because I had to live.

40
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,820
I have no money.

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,850
But I need to start a business.

42
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,410
I needed help,

43
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,500
and this is the only place...

44
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,940
I could get help from.

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,250
Where Ji Eun Oh works, even though you hate me.

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,500
That's why I reached out to Hyeon Su first.

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,750
So, you can't say no.

48
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,670
So you won't be able to.

49
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,390
I know it's a low thing to do.

50
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,610
I wanted to get started...

51
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,980
where you or no one else can see me.

52
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,460
Please...

53
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,640
act like you don't know me.

54
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,320
Just for a few months.

55
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,260
I'll leave once I can breathe.

56
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,140
So...

57
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,530
you're telling me to endure two months, right?

58
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,840
If you quit because you can't even do that,

59
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,580
I'll need to leave.

60
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,940
What did you say?

61
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,100
I can't go that far.

62
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,430
Stay here after kicking you out?

63
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,360
I can't do that.

64
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,650
You said you'd die if not for this place.

65
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,180
Even if I die.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You've got to be kidding me.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,480
What? He'll leave if I leave?

68
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,780
Seriously.

69
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,060
 Stay here after kicking you out? 

70
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,020
 I can't do that. 

71
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,710
He has a conscience, at least, huh?

72
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,500
Gosh, I really hate Lee Ji Hyeok.

73
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,220
I don't mind cleaning.

74
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,930
I want to get back to my desk quickly.

75
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,570
You don't have to come out of there
since there's a window, right?

76
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,570
- Huh?
- From now on,

77
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,860
don't use Hyeon Su to get what you want.

78
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,770
I won't do that.

79
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,230
Don't act like you know me.

80
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,730
Don't say hello.

81
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,560
Don't talk to me.

82
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,740
Please make sure to do these three.

83
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,450
I beg you.

84
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,540
Answer me.

85
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,870
Okay.

86
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,280
We aren't open today. So, I can't make you coffee.

87
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,760
Okay.

88
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,180
This wasn't it.

89
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,220
 No smelly food allowed. 

90
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,010
Geez. I had ramen with the door open.

91
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,020
S-So, Sang Cheol will attend an academy?

92
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,540
He'll study all day from Monday to Saturday.

93
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,240
I'll leave on Saturdays at times.

94
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,490
There are special lectures.

95
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,130
So, electricity-

96
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,740
Yes.

97
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,260
I want to become an expert in electricity.

98
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,090
If I get a technician's certificate
and work for a few years,

99
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,150
I can become an electrician.

100
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,560
Oh, I see.

101
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,890
How impressive, Sang Cheol.

102
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,240
You're studying again.

103
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,840
People live to be 100 these days.

104
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,050
I have a lot of time left.
Learning skills is the best.

105
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,960
 

106
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,650
 

107
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,630
One, two, three, four...

108
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,400
Five, six, seven, eight.

109
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,100
I'm still in good shape.

110
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,390
You don't think I'll die in a year, do you?

111
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,370
My 60-year-old son is learning
a skill to make money.

112
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,930
I can no longer just stay home
and consume food as a mother.

113
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,190
Knock on the door, at least.
Why would you be scared?

114
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,690
"No experience necessary. Elders are welcome."

115
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,350
You definitely said that.

116
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,700
E-Excuse...

117
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,030
I heard you're hiring.

118
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,880
Do you want the job?

119
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,510
Yes. I'm 88 this year. Would that work?

120
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,310
Tell me before I walk past the threshold.

121
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,090
Look at me, ma'am.

122
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,780
Extend your hands.

123
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,760
One, two, three, four, five.

124
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
Do that.

125
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,830
One, two, three, four, five.

126
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,170
You think I'm a child?

127
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,070
You're good. Come in. I'll teach you.

128
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,200
Okay.

129
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,040
- Fold in half and...
- And a big fold.

130
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,680
- Like this? Fold like this?
- That's right.

131
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,260
Yes.

132
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,150
You have a talent.

133
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,580
She's good.

134
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,550
She'll get used to it soon.

135
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,940
Aigoo, I-In...

136
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,550
In-law,

137
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,200
you can't tell my daughter-in-law
that you saw me here.

138
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,720
It'll be a disaster if my son finds out.

139
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, I-I'm keeping it a secret
from Da Jeong, too.

140
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,010
I see.

141
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,890
I'll go home now, then.

142
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,330
Y-You're going home?

143
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,470
You won't fold the envelopes?

144
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,370
How can I when you're there?

145
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,110
I'll quit then. You can work here.

146
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,590
Pardon?

147
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,270
Gosh, why...

148
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,330
The new person can't replace the old one.

149
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,060
In-laws shouldn't do that to each other.

150
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,000
But why should that matter?

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,850
We're just working.

152
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,070
Pardon?

153
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,870
It's hard to get a part-time job
like this at our age.

154
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,820
We just need to keep it a secret from the kids.

155
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,080
By kids,

156
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,860
do you mean, Sang Cheol and Da Jeong?

157
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,120
Yes.

158
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,160
We're almost 90. Why be 
embarrassed and avoid each other?

159
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,170
Don't you think, In-law?

160
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,050
Let's work together.

161
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,940
 

162
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,030
 These have characteristics, too. 

163
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,280
To get more specific,

164
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,130
there are many kinds in this case, too.

165
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,500
This is the same. You need to memorize this part.

166
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,600
Simply memorize the characteristics of each.

167
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
Hey. All the buttons work well.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,070
I checked the external and
 internal links for errors, too.

169
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,320
The images are the correct resolution.

170
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,720
I checked the fonts on the PC and mobile, too.

171
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,720
Gosh. I'm dying to know.

172
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,150
Hey, the website will launch today, right?

173
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,330
What business is he trying to run?

174
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,430
I know, huh?

175
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,400
It must be an online shop, right?

176
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,130
Is he selling regional specialty products?

177
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,340
Where are you going?

178
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,760
I need to create a business account
and run some errands.

179
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,400
You must've launched the website. What do you do?

180
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,700
Check for yourself. mamdaerozip*.co.kr.
(Means "Custom Homes," "Whatever you want")

181
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,960
- Mamdae...
- Custom Homes.

182
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,100
Mamdaerozip...

183
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,400
Huh? It's Custom Homes.

184
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,080
Eun Oh...

185
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,470
mamdaerozip.co.kr.

186
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,840
I'm so curious.

187
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,040
mamdaerozip.co.kr.

188
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,500
 

189
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,140
 To help you finish your DIY interior design, 

190
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,610
 we'll connect you to a coordinator. 

191
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,600
Connect DIY interior design and coordinator?

192
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,330
Eun Oh.

193
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,000
I knew it.

194
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,380
You knew it?

195
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,130
I said his business will be all pretense.

196
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,110
He's not an interior design expert.

197
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,910
But he'll connect DIYers with coordinators?

198
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,570
How will he run this business?

199
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,430
You can't do it unless you know everything
about interior design.

200
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,380
You're right.

201
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,260
He has renovated all sorts
of houses while in the club.

202
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,110
He's basically an expert…
This is still too random.

203
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,760
Was he this bad?

204
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,970
 Oppa, I'm here. 

205
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,230
 

206
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,330
 

207
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,950
 

208
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,410
Custom Homes?

209
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,980
Oppa.

210
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,500
- Hey. Hold on-
- Hurry.

211
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,930
 

212
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,040
 

213
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,900
This is so much.

214
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,250
I thought only the two of us were having lunch.

215
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,250
You think this is a lot?

216
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,610
These are all the dishes you've eaten.

217
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,480
They didn't have the Cajun salad.

218
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,700
So, I ordered the steak salad. You like beef.

219
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,340
Lemonade?

220
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,030
Yes.

221
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,700
You used to order these dishes with your friends.

222
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,800
They are your favorites. 
Isn't lemonade your absolute favorite?

223
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,310
Oppa, that's when I ate mindlessly,
studying for the college entrance exam

224
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,640
and weighed over 60 kg.

225
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,130
Can't you see my body right now?

226
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
- You don't look that different.
- Oppa!

227
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,040
You've always been Ji Hyeok's little sister.

228
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,350
So embarrassing.

229
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,330
You eat all of this.

230
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,150
I don't drink lemonade anymore.

231
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,740
It's too sweet.

232
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,000
You drink iced Americano, right? This isn't sweet.

233
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Ever since I lost weight in college,
I've been at this weight.

234
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,760
Men don't notice stuff like that.

235
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,710
I wanted to get you everything you wanted.

236
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,300
Take your time and eat little by little.

237
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,650
Anything else you don't like anymore?

238
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,100
Seong Jae,

239
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,110
you're refusing to be on my YouTube channel, huh?

240
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,290
Yes.

241
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll completely censor your face this time.

242
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,200
My face is one thing, but it's not for me.

243
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,530
Gaining thousands of subscribers
 because of me won't fix anything.

244
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,290
That's why I refuse.

245
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,810
How about...

246
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,990
I help you find a job?

247
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,520
Why would you?

248
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,840
I don't want you to.

249
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,280
I don't want an office job, Oppa.

250
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,870
What do you want, then? Being a YouTuber?

251
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,730
I'll become a successful YouTuber

252
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,330
and marry a man who's also rich.

253
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,110
I'll definitely get married.

254
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,000
A rich man?

255
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,580
Aigoo.

256
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,650
Lee Su Bin, you-

257
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,110
Don't assume.

258
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,670
I said, a man who is "also" rich.

259
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,430
That's why I joined a matchmaking service.

260
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,470
Matchmaking service?

261
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,510
Are you out of your mind...

262
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,620
Do your parents know?

263
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,410
Of course, they don't.

264
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,680
And Oppa, you keep talking to me with bias.

265
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,790
Listen to me first.

266
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,410
I think one can't help their status
they were born with.

267
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,340
That's why I have no complaints.

268
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,790
But I think I have the right to overcome it.

269
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,870
Using money?

270
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,640
He'll also be rich.

271
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,160
He'll be nice, handsome,
and most importantly, competent.

272
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,100
He'll come from a good family, and he'll love me.

273
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,300
That's why I signed up for a service
that could provide that.

274
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,380
To meet someone who meets
my criteria and start dating first.

275
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,240
You have a clear logic of your own.

276
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,120
I'm being very reasonable.

277
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,080
Marriage has to be a win-win situation.

278
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,050
My goodness.

279
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,370
You sure are Ji Hyeok's sister.

280
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm confident I can be
a good girlfriend and a wife.

281
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,710
But the fact that middle-class people like me
just marry purely for love.

282
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,370
No. I don't like that.

283
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,060
I don't want to suffer.

284
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,130
You can call me calculative.

285
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,200
Life is a battle to get what you want.

286
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,680
Battle?

287
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,440
Okay, I agree.

288
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,150
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

289
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,410
It's been so long, pané.

290
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,810
It's so good to see you.

291
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,200
Here.

292
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,780
Oppa, thank you for the feast. I'm going this way.

293
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,570
Hold on, Su Bin.

294
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,100
Let me give you pocket money.

295
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,740
You look down on me, don't you?

296
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,110
I'll take it from Ji Hyeok, but not you.

297
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,830
There are tons of men who want
to give me pocket money.

298
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,640
They line up to do that.

299
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,720
Good for you.

300
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,350
Go. You said you have a meeting.

301
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,700
Okay.

302
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,310
Call me if anything happens.

303
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,010
Why can't he just come?

304
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,100
No. It's not good to be dependent.

305
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,400
By the way, he looks good from behind.

306
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,110
 

307
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,800
Carbs will only make me feel drowsy.

308
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,310
 

309
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,220
 

310
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,500
 

311
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,780
Tomorrow?

312
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,060
 

313
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,310
Hello. I want to start a business account.

314
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,220
- This, right?
- Yes.

315
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,950
I did 30% based on the website,

316
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,080
but there's an issue with signing up.

317
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,570
This will take longer than we thought.

318
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,180
How about we do a social media login, then?

319
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,610
Matte would be better than glossy, right?

320
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,250
Hello.

321
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,480
 

322
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,480
Sunbae, a package...

323
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,230
Yes, please go ahead.

324
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,080
 

325
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,690
 This is urgent. 

326
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,960
 We tried to do a DIY remodel, 

327
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,990
 but we switched to a turnkey service. 

328
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,640
 But the service took our payment and disappeared. 

329
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,180
 We have two weeks to finish.
Please give me a call. 

330
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,910
 Hello? 

331
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,060
Hello, this is Custom Homes.

332
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,650
 Yes. I wrote you. We're in an urgent situation. 

333
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,100
 I can pay for a coordinator. We have a plan. 

334
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,170
Would you like to stop by our office, then?

335
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,660
 I'm nearby right now. 

336
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,360
 You're inside a cafe, right? 

337
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,240
Well, yes.

338
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,340
Okay. I'll see you in a bit.

339
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,740
Okay.

340
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,220
Sunbae, you have packages.

341
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,820
Thank you.

342
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,670
Sorry.

343
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,810
I said there's an office inside a cafe.

344
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,330
I just received them for you.

345
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,030
What are they?

346
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,280
Huh?

347
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,500
Custom Homes coordinator's uniform.

348
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,950
When did you prepare all this?

349
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,550
You came to Seoul just recently.

350
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,590
It's the age of e-commerce.

351
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,570
Did you prepare everything before coming to Seoul?

352
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,050
Probably, right?

353
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,760
 

354
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,930
 

355
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,960
I'll go.

356
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,380
Okay.

357
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,910
Director.

358
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,970
 
Here.

359
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,470
- Did you see the website?
- Yes, I saw it.

360
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,540
Eun Oh.

361
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,520
Director.

362
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,150
Eun Oh is busy. Carry on.

363
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:05,210
Ji Hyeok seemed busy, too.

364
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,780
You worked for less than a year there?

365
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,910
Okay, got it.

366
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,820
Okay, thank you. Bye.

367
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,520
Here, give me.

368
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,390
It's orange jasmine.
It purifies the air, apparently.

369
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,250
How sweet.

370
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,830
How's it going?

371
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,440
You have nothing to say, right?

372
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,060
Keep it to yourself, even if you do.

373
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,770
But remember.

374
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,510
This is the first chapter
of your friend, Lee Ji Hyeok's second life.

375
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,620
Okay. I'll remember.

376
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,920
I'm sorry, by the way.

377
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,580
I don't have time to have a long chat.

378
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,030
I'm busy with work right now.

379
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,180
When will you free up time for me?

380
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,600
I came to Seoul just a few days ago.

381
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,440
Hasn't Eun Oh told you that I'm really busy?

382
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,420
Isn't his office funny?

383
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,750
It's like a storage and an office.

384
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,470
It's like an office and a storage.

385
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,420
Where are we getting together this week?

386
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,900
We need to ask our leader about that.

387
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,950
Leader? Do you mean me, by chance?

388
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,690
Yes. You must be busy
since you just started a new project.

389
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,410
We only get together when the leader tells us to.

390
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,520
- Right?
- Right.

391
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,930
Come on, Director.

392
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,940
What? Are you using your fist now?

393
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,760
It's because you made me the leader.

394
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,450
Wow. Yes. One-two. One-two.

395
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,170
Yes. Look at you. Wow. Gosh.

396
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,710
Excuse me.

397
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,690
Where's Custom Homes?

398
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,450
Over here. Come this way.

399
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,200
Okay.

400
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,660
You want to finalize the commission now?

401
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,120
I'm so sick of looking for a service.

402
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,660
You said the coordinator hires
contractors and manages the project.

403
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,360
I was so happy to find you.

404
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,880
Do you want to sign the contract now, then?

405
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,490
Let's talk for a moment.

406
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,980
I don't talk to strangers.

407
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,040
I found a client on my first day.

408
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,330
I want you to be the coordinator
for my first client.

409
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,660
I don't want to.

410
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,430
I'll pay you 20 million.

411
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,570
A coordinator should only make a few million.

412
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,790
But you'll pay me 20 million?

413
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,690
You aren't just a coordinator.

414
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,340
I'm recruiting you to have someone
trustworthy on my first case.

415
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,200
There was an applicant for the job.

416
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,610
There will be another one tomorrow.

417
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,760
I'm not asking you because I don't have anyone.

418
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,460
I refuse.

419
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,510
It's 20 million. You refuse?

420
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,780
Don't talk to me casually.

421
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,230
I knew you'd say no.

422
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,840
But I thought I should beg you once.

423
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,660
I'm desperate.

424
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,310
But...

425
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,130
I was just making a business offer, Eun Oh.

426
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,420
What's he saying?

427
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,950
I agreed not to quit since
he said I won't be seeing him.

428
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
Of course, she said no.

429
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,050
But couldn't she just do it?

430
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,350
I said I'd pay her 20 million.

431
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,280
Does she despise me that much?

432
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,740
Yes, that's so Eun Oh. So Eun Oh.

433
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,540
He not only took over the storage,

434
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,080
he asked me to do what?

435
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,390
I'll never do it.

436
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,680
Offer me 200 million. I'll still say no.

437
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,650
I'll do it for 200 million.

438
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,660
675%.

439
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,010
Daebak. Daebak...

440
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,400
I don't want to sell now.

441
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,220
What if it rises more?

442
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,760
 You really can get 100 million? How? 

443
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,810
This is how.

444
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,900
No. Don't get greedy and sell.

445
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,200
Use 100 million for the business
 and buy a car with 50 million.

446
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,070
Don't be greedy and sell.

447
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,610
 

448
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,790
What's wrong?

449
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,930
What?

450
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,250
Huh? What's going on?

451
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,430
My 155 million.

452
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,990
 I'm home. 

453
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,330
Welcome. You must be tired.

454
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,330
He must've heard you. Why isn't he coming out?

455
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,450
Why would he come out for me?

456
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,770
He must be playing a video game.

457
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:57,570
No. He said he has some happy news for you.

458
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:01,240
How can he make me happy, Mom?

459
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,840
Ji Gang Oh,

460
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,120
I heard you were awake a moment ago.
Don't pretend you're asleep.

461
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,990
He falls asleep so easily.

462
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,390
 

463
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,480
You've been into that book lately.

464
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,100
This book is so jam-packed
that I want to memorize it.

465
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,300
Although the sentences are short.

466
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,350
Honey, why are there so many
things to learn in this world?

467
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,860
"Live Your Only Life This Way"?

468
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,160
You can't only do what you want to do in life.

469
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,640
His position is very different than mine.

470
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,060
Gosh. That means I disagree with you.

471
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,990
We're still a match made in heaven.

472
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,660
You don't have to share the same
thoughts to live together.

473
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,910
You're good at making a balance with everything.

474
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,310
I've been trying to catch up
with you my whole life.

475
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,880
Right. You're looking for Seong Jae's
marriage partner, right?

476
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,680
Of course, I am.

477
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,390
But it's not easy, as you know.

478
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,070
Should I ask him out for a drink?

479
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,460
You asked me to wait for him to approach you.

480
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,790
But I have no idea what he's thinking.

481
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,540
He's been like that since he was a kid.

482
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,920
That's why you can't push him too much.

483
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,060
But still. He'll be the company's successor.

484
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,150
I feel bad about holding onto him as a director.

485
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,850
It makes me feel bad.

486
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,740
He's very different than you.

487
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,000
You're adventurous and have strong opinions.

488
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,590
But he's not ambitious like you, is he?

489
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,540
That's the issue.

490
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,340
I know.

491
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,060
That's why I'm afraid
of forcing the company on him.

492
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,850
Same with marriage.

493
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,910
What if he acts out again?

494
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,840
 

495
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,340
 

496
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,470
 

497
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,810
Gosh. He's so unpredictable.

498
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,250
How does it make sense for you to do this?

499
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,970
What do I do with him?

500
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,850
 

501
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,010
 

502
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,450
 Hello, this is Su Bin. 

503
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:21,080
 I transformed into a different
 look today once again. 

504
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,260
 

505
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,020
 

506
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,510
 

507
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,010
Does he not know how to conserve energy?

508
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,410
Don't bother.

509
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,610
Let him sleep with the lights on.

510
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,230
Wait...

511
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,300
My eyes!

512
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,770
What? How is that possible?

513
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,650
He fell asleep while washing his face?

514
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,450
How could he fall asleep with soap on his face?

515
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,710
Did he stay up all night?

516
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,220
Geez. He really bothers me.

517
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,120
 Instead of Normal Hotel, 

518
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,100
 go to Genew Hotel's gym starting today. 

519
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,050
Genew Hotel?

520
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,710
That's the one.

521
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,270
Why did she switch to one further from home?

522
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,330
Excuse me.

523
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,070
Sir.

524
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,460
What?

525
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,480
The air purifier isn't working hard enough.

526
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,520
Did you call me, sir?

527
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,670
Why am I a sir?

528
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,910
You got angry when I called you a driver.

529
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,100
Hey, just call me Mr. Lee.

530
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,640
Why call me sir? How annoying.

531
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,470
You've got to be kidding me.

532
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,920
You've been silent for over a week.

533
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,210
Now you call me a sir?

534
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,640
Hey, forget it. Forget it.

535
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,680
Enjoy your workout.

536
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,950
What did I do wrong?

537
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,770
Sir is an honorific.

538
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,980
I need to ask you something.

539
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,820
My temporary driver slash bodyguard
is my brother's friend's brother.

540
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,430
He's about two years older than me.

541
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,050
What am I supposed to call him?

542
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,670
 Are your brother and the driver
slash bodyguard's brother close? 

543
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:39,020
Yes. Oppa told me he's a friend he trusts.

544
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,040
 Doesn't "Oppa" sound appropriate, then? 

545
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,880
 Or call each other by name instead. 

546
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,880
So, "Driver" or "Sir" weren't appropriate.

547
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,740
 If he's a temp, he's more like a part-timer. 

548
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,840
Calling him "Driver" or "Sir" could
make him uncomfortable.

549
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,260
 You arrived safely, right? 

550
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,030
 What are you up to now? 

551
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,950
 I'm in the restroom. 

552
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,900
Four.

553
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,470
Five.

554
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,030
Six.

555
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,230
You came.

556
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,380
Who's the new lady?

557
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,970
I didn't see her last week.

558
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,860
She must be a new member.

559
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,280
She's not bad.

560
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,500
She has a refreshing aura.

561
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,610
You notice girls more
since you're back in Korea, right?

562
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,880
I did, too.

563
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,320
I'm not like you.

564
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,280
It depends on the woman.

565
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:47,720
 We can't do any better. 

566
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,780
This is hard for me to handle alone, Yeong Ra.

567
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,440
I hope you capture his heart.

568
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,300
You just started. Let's see how it goes.

569
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,310
 

570
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,440
 

571
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,250
Director Ko.

572
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,100
Here's the list and information
of the scholarship recipients.

573
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,660
And here are the docent candidates you requested.

574
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,240
Okay.

575
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,840
Make a reservation at the Chinese
place for the award ceremony day.

576
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,810
The CEO and I will eat at the Japanese place.

577
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,140
There will be four of us, including two reporters.

578
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,190
I'll take you to the studio since
you don't have a plan today.

579
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,950
Why are you doing this to me?

580
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,560
What did I do?

581
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,650
Why are you suddenly talking to me formally?

582
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,690
The driver should talk formally to his lady.

583
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,760
I can't be so rude and...

584
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,470
talk to you casually. I'd end up getting slapped.

585
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,620
I'm sorry, Oppa.

586
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,240
Oppa?

587
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,300
Hey, what's with you?

588
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,090
You'll tell your mom about it, won't you?

589
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,790
Why would I?

590
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,720
Why do you suddenly call me that, then?

591
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,480
It's unlike you.

592
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,260
I asked AI.

593
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,270
It said "Oppa" is appropriate.

594
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,970
AI?

595
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,950
It doesn't agree with my mom,

596
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:22,730
but I thought it'd be right
since it's artificial intelligence.

597
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,150
You're really something.

598
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,480
Yes. How could a person beat AI?

599
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,560
A person has a limited point of view,

600
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,140
but AI is a culmination
of vast information and knowledge.

601
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,930
It's the whole package.

602
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,810
Ask AI everything from now on.

603
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,200
And ask AI about how you shouldn't
 tell your mom that I said this, too.

604
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,420
Why are you laughing?

605
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,100
Because you're funny.

606
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm funny?

607
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,600
You're two minutes behind schedule.

608
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,100
Let's go.

609
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,450
I emailed you the edited plan and quote.

610
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,580
I reflected on everything you said.

611
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,960
Please check and let me know.

612
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,610
Okay.

613
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,000
You worked hard.

614
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,160
You can sleep well for a few nights now.

615
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,850
That's the plan.

616
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,320
My back hurts because I've been
working in the living room.

617
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,160
You're right.

618
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,610
You can't pull all-nighters here
because of Ji Hyeok.

619
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,920
I couldn't,

620
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,490
but I'll also pull all-nighters here from now on.

621
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,540
I can't work at home
if I start the Director's project.

622
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,910
Right. Why aren't you meeting
with the expensive project lady?

623
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,520
Oh, her?

624
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,150
 I care more about the quality
than how quickly it's done. 

625
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,200
 So, take your time working on it 

626
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,900
 and do other work, too. 

627
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,760
 You should work a lot at your age. 

628
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,230
How could she be so considerate?

629
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,630
She paid you the design fee already, too.

630
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,110
That's how rich people are.

631
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,640
I think she's careful.

632
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,840
She's serious about this project, too.

633
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,200
Director.

634
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,300
What a relief. You haven't left yet.

635
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,570
Ta-da.

636
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,430
I guess I haven't left to receive this.

637
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,360
He didn't call this time, either.

638
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,530
How will she eat all that?

639
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,860
I'll go wash my hands.

640
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,000
What are you doing here?

641
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,810
Can't I buy myself coffee?

642
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:43,080
Well, I thought you didn't have time
to come out for coffee.

643
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,890
I told you to wait until I call.

644
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,280
Hey.

645
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,830
That was for Eun Oh.

646
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,770
Eun Oh?

647
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,820
There's her father's memorial service today.

648
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,170
By the way,

649
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,190
why do you buy fruit
for her father's memorial day?

650
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:12,630
Why can't I buy my junior some fruit for that?

651
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,500
It's not weird to buy it for her and her family.

652
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,650
Is that so?

653
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,750
But Eun Oh doesn't like bananas.
She won't eat them.

654
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,990
What?

655
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,200
Ask her.

656
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,320
That's right. I don't like bananas.

657
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,000
I sent you bananas when you were sick.

658
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,640
The sight of them must make her feel sick.

659
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,240
How did you not know that?

660
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,550
Is that why you ate the gift I received?

661
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,720
I thought it was for me.

662
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,470
You should get going, Eun Oh.

663
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,890
- It's rush hour soon.
- Okay.

664
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,820
I'll add this to the memorial service table.

665
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,760
I'll enjoy them with my family, too. Thank you.

666
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,910
- See you tomorrow, Su Jeong.
- Bye.

667
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,240
When did you learn about her father's
memorial service day?

668
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,930
I heard he passed away when she was in 12th grade.

669
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,670
He must've been very young, then.

670
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,390
How did he pass away?

671
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:13,340
You know her well enough
to remember his memorial service day.

672
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,900
How could you not know that? Geez.

673
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,870
He looks mad at you, Director.

674
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,320
"How could you not know that?"

675
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,680
Let him be mad.

676
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,830
If he passed when she was in 12th grade...

677
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,670
He must've been a lot younger than my father.

678
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,230
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

679
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,200
Thank you.

680
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,610
Thank you.

681
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,630
Thank you.

682
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,310
When was the last time...

683
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:38,410
Dad had the tteokbokki I made?

684
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,920
It's already been 12 years.

685
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:46,850
I should've made it for him when he was alive.

686
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:52,170
He would've been so moved that

687
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,450
he would've died from a heart attack then.

688
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,940
You say funny things sometimes, too.

689
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:06,270
Tteokbokki still cracks me up to this day.

690
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,860
Your dad always wanted to have tteokbokki
with you and played all kinds of tricks.

691
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,720
To not include Gang Oh and me.

692
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:19,410
That's why I thought he actually liked tteokbokki.

693
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,990
He acted like he did since it's my favorite.

694
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,560
I'm sure he still likes it.

695
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,540
Because you cherish your memory with him.

696
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,300
I miss him.

697
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,030
Honey,

698
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,410
you're doing well, right?

699
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,090
Eun Oh, Gang Oh, and I are...

700
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,710
doing well, although not
as well as when you were around.

701
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,600
Especially thanks to Eun Oh.

702
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,440
Your beloved Eun Oh

703
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,770
became the head of the family instead of you,

704
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,720
and she opened a shop for me, too.

705
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,980
Right. We live, thanks to Eun Oh.

706
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,620
I'm doing so well right now

707
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,220
all thanks to you, Dad.

708
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,020
You raised me like this.

709
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,900
Why don't you do anything, Dad?

710
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,030
Why are you just watching me?

711
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,940
Because I trust you.

712
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,440
What?

713
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,730
Even if I don't do anything,

714
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:11,180
you can overcome it when you feel
 sad, angry, or scared

715
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,780
even if you cry. You're a strong child.

716
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,300
Am I?

717
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,850
Aren't you?

718
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:20,000
I am.

719
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,810
Yes, you are.

720
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,990
That's why I trust you.

721
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,820
I always will.

722
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,100
Mom, I got Dad's tenacity, right?

723
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,260
He was kind, but very scary when he was mad.

724
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:42,320
That's why he became successful on his own.

725
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,260
I didn't know back then, either.

726
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,470
I lived like a queen, thanks to him.

727
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,290
Why did he go bankrupt, then?
 He should've done well until the end.

728
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,210
Ji Gang Oh, shut your mouth.

729
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,870
Keep praising him, then.

730
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,060
He always cared about you more than me.

731
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,250
Because I was a worse student than you.

732
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,760
I was good at soccer.

733
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,580
You really don't get your father.

734
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,260
I'll leave since we're done.

735
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,470
I'm meeting someone.

736
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,360
Ji Gang Oh,

737
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,700
is something up with you? Tell me.

738
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,800
What if there was?

739
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,240
Are you in a good mood since
it's Father's memorial day?

740
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,810
Why do you act like a know-it-all?
Can you afford to help me?

741
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,380
Hey. Get back here!

742
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,240
Hello?

743
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,130
Eun Oh, stop.

744
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,410
By the way,

745
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:37,550
he didn't cause serious trouble, did he?

746
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,940
No, he couldn't have.

747
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,250
What's wrong with him?

748
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,260
Is he sick?

749
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,950
What? What?

750
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,650
Why are you grunting, Honey?

751
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,430
Are you sick?

752
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:15,910
No, I'm okay. Get back to sleep.

753
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,780
 I'm checking your schedule. 

754
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,880
Okay. Text me the dates you're available, then.

755
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,500
Thank you. Bye.

756
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,180
Su Jeong told me to do the afternoon shift alone.

757
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,920
But you came in early.

758
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,570
I have something to do today.

759
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:03,030
Noona! Noona! Noona!

760
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,330
What? What's wrong? What's going on?

761
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,060
Help me, Noona.

762
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,650
You have 30 million won, right?

763
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:12,210
Give me just 20 million.

764
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:16,210
Homes are all about the wives.

765
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:18,960
I'm more than experienced with housewives.

766
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,030
You no longer work with your business partner

767
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,400
because of disagreements, right?

768
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,860
Yes. It's impossible to work the same amount.

769
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:30,360
Splitting the workload in half is kind of stressful.

770
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,880
Oh, okay. Got it.

771
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,460
- I'll be in touch, then.
- Okay.

772
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,670
 Ji Gang Oh, what did you just say? 

773
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:41,640
 You borrowed against Mom's shop? 

774
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,080
 That's not important right now! 

775
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,980
 I said I'm about to die. 

776
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,270
 Did you say private loan just now? 

777
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,180
- This way.
 - Yes. 

778
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,820
I borrowed 20 million from a private lender.

779
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,250
They'll cut my hand off if I don't pay back, Noona.

780
00:52:54,250 --> 00:53:00,090
Wow. What a nice and spacious cafe.

781
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,160
Excuse us.

782
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,980
There are no customers, unfortunately.

783
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,450
Noona.

784
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,400
You aren't excused.

785
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,640
Hey.

786
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,900
Geez. Hey.

787
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,550
Why don't you know how to speak appropriately?

788
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,400
I'm sorry.

789
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,300
The person who made us come here is Ji Gang Oh.

790
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,340
Your little brother.

791
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:27,920
First of all, he's the one you lent money to.

792
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,640
You can't demand payment
from the family according to the law.

793
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,160
So, don't create a scene here. Get out.

794
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,520
Don't try to harass me.

795
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:40,970
If we left,

796
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:44,830
your mom's shop will be... Okay?

797
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,730
I know. I get it.

798
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,540
I'll come up with a solution.

799
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,420
So, get out of here. Right now!

800
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:57,100
Geez... Look at this cute girl.

801
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:06,190
 

802
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,210
Let's drink together. Come on.

803
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,170
No, no. Sunbae!

804
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,210
Hey, Kim Tae Su!

805
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,250
Hey, stop being gross during group meals.

806
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,610
I don't care if you're my senior.

807
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,320
Hey.

808
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,940
I'm a loan shark.

809
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,230
Until your brother pays me back,

810
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,190
I'll do it my way.

811
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,900
Take him with you, then.

812
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,630
If I take him with you,

813
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,370
he'll lose a hand.

814
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,190
Cut it off if you want.

815
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:53,690
It should be cut if that's what he deserves.

816
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,630
Noona.

817
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,590
You leave, too, Ji Gang Oh.

818
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,850
She doesn't get it.

819
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,600
Just like her stupid brother.

820
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,140
You bitch. Do you want to die?

821
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,520
Stop!

822
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,370
Stop moving.

823
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,530
I recorded you vandalizing and threatening.

824
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,870
"Leave quietly.

825
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,720
Don't ever show up here again."

826
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,580
That's what the manager said.

827
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:36,080
Hyungnim, let's leave
since we showed them a preview.

828
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,860
Okay. Let's leave for now.

829
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,600
Ji Gang Oh, it's by noon tomorrow.

830
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,170
We're leaving today. But I'll see you tomorrow.

831
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,520
My office is here.

832
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,140
Don't interrupt us!

833
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,980
Ji Gang Oh,

834
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,700
you leave, too.

835
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,040
How could I leave now?

836
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,880
You bastard. Mom must be alone at the shop.

837
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,510
Stop them from harassing her.

838
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,810
Even if you lose your hand!

839
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:20,760
You'd better not let Mom get even a scratch.

840
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,330
Noona.

841
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,870
Should I cut your hand off?

842
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:26,160
You know I have an ax, right?

843
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,390
Noona...

844
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,230
Manager,

845
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,630
are you okay?

846
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:45,000
Yes. I'm okay. I'll step out.

847
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,140
24 million in cash?

848
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,140
What is it for?

849
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,280
Loan sharks demanded cash.

850
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,810
Is there an issue?

851
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,900
 

852
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,090
 

853
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,020
Don't ever lend him money again.

854
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:15,540
If you do, I won't give you a penny then.

855
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,560
This is my last of my precious money.

856
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,690
By the way, Ms. Ji, why are you so brave?

857
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,910
Because I have the law. The law of this country.

858
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:25,640
Gosh. Is that why you're speaking casually?

859
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,670
I speak casually if someone does it to me first.

860
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,030
Let's go.

861
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,030
I really thought it was a stock company site.

862
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:43,190
You would've been fooled, too.

863
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,940
I'm not the only victim.
You heard it from the police.

864
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,360
There are 697 victims.

865
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,290
You promised not to join
a stock reading site again.

866
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:56,900
But not all of them are a scam.

867
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,700
You bastard.

868
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,640
Do you know how precious that money is to her?

869
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,540
She should at least own a used car now.

870
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,600
She keeps getting new projects.

871
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,600
She can't ride the bus all the time.

872
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,390
And you tried to invest in a dating bar?

873
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,260
You wanted to invest 100 million in it?

874
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,060
You thought that was realistic?

875
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,430
You don't have 100 million won!

876
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,690
That's why I wanted to put it together.

877
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,710
Everyone invests in crypto and stocks these days.

878
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,030
You can't make money otherwise.

879
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:30,930
Gang Oh, if we run this shop well and

880
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:34,900
when I get old, it'd end up being yours.

881
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,010
Noona told us to do that.

882
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,780
Don't you think I have a dream?

883
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:41,380
I would've been like Son Heung Min
if I weren't injured.

884
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,560
I wouldn't have been a failure
if I had taught private soccer lessons.

885
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,230
Sign an IOU...

886
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:51,190
for the 24 million I paid for you.

887
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:55,630
Get paid 500,000 won from now on
and pay me a million a month.

888
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,740
- Noona.
- And Mom,

889
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,390
make him work until the shop closes.

890
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:03,320
Send me a photo of the door closing every day.

891
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,090
You won't get paid 500,000 won
if you don't even do that.

892
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:10,740
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

893
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:21,800
We need to talk.

894
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,270
You said 20 million, right?

895
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,660
Y-Yes.

896
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,180
I'll do it.

897
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:33,460
Should we sign a contract, then?

898
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:38,660
You said it was a business offer yesterday.

899
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,980
Let's sign the contract, Manager Ji.

900
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,690
I'm working on an apartment in Mapo right now.

901
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:46,970
It might overlap with the construction schedule.

902
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,260
Of course.

903
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:51,910
The coordinator won't be a coordinator
if she's at the site all day.

904
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,030
You know the first day is for demolition, right?

905
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:13,710
I already hired a demolition service.

906
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:17,000
Here's the original schedule that I modified.

907
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,260
This is the final plan from the client.

908
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:26,830
The 10% of the contract fee will
be sent tomorrow morning.

909
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,550
I'll look at the files today

910
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:33,680
and discuss the rest with the client.

911
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,120
 I could've just eaten myself. 

912
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,340
You didn't get enough sleep.

913
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:45,270
I have to cook you breakfast
on your first day of work.

914
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,500
You leave at six.

915
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,710
More importantly,

916
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:53,050
I'm worried I can't monitor Gang Oh for a while.

917
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:57,630
I won't be able to do my occasional
surprise inspection.

918
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,660
If he's a human, he won't just last 10 days

919
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,650
and run away because you're gone.

920
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,360
Right?

921
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,330
What an immature bastard.

922
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:17,680
The demo manager couldn't have known the passcode.

923
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,010
What's this?

924
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:35,480
Are you here as the CEO
since it's the first project?

925
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,990
No.

926
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:37,960
What is it, then?

927
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,630
I'm here as a laborer today.

928
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,270
Laborer?

929
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:46,050
You need a laborer on the first demo day.

930
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,500
I'm that laborer.

931
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,480
So, you'll be working here?

932
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,970
Yes. Right here.

933
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:39,600
 ♫ Your bright presence shines in the dark night ♫ 

934
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:45,700
 It means I'm a pathetic dad. 

935
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,360
 Hey, Hyeok! Ji Hyeok! 

936
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,760
 Hyung! You knew that,
and you didn't come home while in Seoul? 

937
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,850
 You couldn't even call? 

938
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:54,320
 You don't have the right to
be snarky with me. Why are you snarky? 

939
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,930
 Seong Jae and I've known
each other for nine years, too. 

940
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:58,450
 You thought of me as a joke, didn't you? 

941
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:01,470
 I'll go down if I have to without getting help. 

942
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,480
 You can't use muscles after eating that. 

943
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,890
 I know how much you eat. 

944
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:07,920
 You know how much a stranger eats, Manager Ji? 

945
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,760
 Let's just be strangers. Strangers. 

946
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,940
 Is that so hard? 

947
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,190
 You're the one who barged in here. 

948
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:16,930
 ♫ I'm looking at you, my light ♫
