1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,640
 

2
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,870
Hey...

3
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,830
But why do I have to hide?

4
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,690
"Thank you for applying to the
after-school teaching position.

5
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,960
Unfortunately, you will not
be joining us this time.

6
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,140
Thank you."

7
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,560
What are they thanking me for?

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,960
They should at least let me have
an interview if that's the case.

9
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,210
 When you're over 50, 

10
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,290
 you don't even get called
for an interview for desk jobs. 

11
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,200
How is that fair?

12
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,680
They said age doesn't matter.

13
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,050
 

14
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,690
I can do a good job caring for children.

15
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,240
Yes. Hello?

16
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,880
Isn't this Ms. Kim Da Jeong's phone?

17
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,480
Sang Cheol?

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,050
Yes. Are you happy about something?

19
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,580
Not at all.

20
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,630
Why did you call?

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,780
Well, don't you have anything to tell me?

22
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,380
What's with you?

23
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,790
No, it's nothing. Hang up. Hang up.

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,410
How could he not even call us while he's in Seoul?

25
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,760
Hello.

26
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,860
Nice to meet you. I'm CEO Lee Ji Hyeok
of Custom Homes.

27
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,410
I'm Kang Dong Hun, a back-end developer.

28
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,330
- I talked to you over the phone.
- Yes.

29
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,410
This is Lee Jae Hyeon, a front-end developer.

30
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,620
This is Jeong Yu Jin, a designer.

31
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,880
I'm Lee Jae Hyeon.

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,580
I heard you run your business like a bulldozer.

33
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,080
I'm nervous already.

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm Jeong Yu Jin. I feel the same way as he.

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,800
You must've seen the prototype
designed by my senior, right?

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Can I hear your feedback first? Let's have a seat.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,550
- Okay.
- Okay.

38
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,340
I see. The part-timer was in a car accident.

39
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,950
Thankfully, he wasn't seriously injured.

40
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,090
But he's a bit older.

41
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,240
- I see.
- Right.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,780
You can work today, right?

43
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,370
Yes, yes. Of course.

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,470
I'll teach you how to use the register first.

45
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,860
- Come here for a moment.
- Okay.

46
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,890
I'll meet you at the showroom then.

47
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,980
Okay. You worked a lot.
You should rest for a few days.

48
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,340
Okay.

49
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,220
 Breaking news. Lee Ji Hyeok is back. 

50
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,920
 What do you mean by that? 

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,730
 Did he show up? 

52
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,640
I'm a fool for staying in this chat.

53
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,540
 

54
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,910
Mom, you're still awake.

55
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,480
Hey, Eun Oh.

56
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,480
You came home earlier than I thought.

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,950
You said you might stay up all night.

58
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,600
I got so sleepy. I'm hungry, too.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,350
Really?

60
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,470
I made some pumpkin porridge
for your breakfast tomorrow.

61
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,600
Get changed and come out.

62
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,770
My favorite pumpkin porridge.

63
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,900
She'll search the whole house
looking for her phone now.

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,930
 You can't do this if you're my birth mom. 

65
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,890
 I'm sorry, Gang Oh. 

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,470
Here's the Americano.

67
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

68
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,490
Eun Oh.

69
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,350
- Hurry.
- Hurry, hurry.

70
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,460
- I heard Ji Hyeok's office is here.
- Yes.

71
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,720
- How could you keep it a secret?
- I know.

72
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
Oh, are you waiting for him, by chance?

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,600
Of course.

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,490
- I'm here, too.
- Hi.

75
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,870
- Long time no see.
- Hello.

76
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,770
- Long time no see, Eun Oh.
- Yes.

77
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,390
Ji Eun Oh, sit here.

78
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,100
If you don't divulge the story,
we'll be so disappointed.

79
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,030
I need to do something urgently right now.

80
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,580
- Hey, Eun Oh! Don't be like that-
- Jun Sang.

81
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,200
Hey,

82
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,280
Jun Sang announced a last-minute
meeting. Didn't you see it?

83
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,930
I left the chat.

84
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,900
Tell the storage room guy not to come in today.

85
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,300
Okay.

86
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,230
I want to register an MVP version
on the app store in a month.

87
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,190
A month?

88
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,490
Excuse me.

89
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,570
A month is...

90
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,510
 People from Hangyeol Value,
including Jun Sang, are here right now. 

91
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,330
 They're drinking. 

92
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,590
 Just their luck. Why did they come today? 

93
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,990
 I wasn't going to come today, anyway. 

94
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,480
 I have a development meeting all night. 

95
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,280
Shall we discuss the details, then?

96
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,090
I want to add the coordinator
registration function.

97
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,780
 Our studio will, of course, have two painters, 

98
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,170
 and one stationary or houseware designer. 

99
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,070
 I'm thinking about having three people. 

100
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,660
What if the gallery space
disrupts the artists' work?

101
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,600
Eun Oh, Ji Hyeok said he won't come in today.

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,890
He has a development meeting all night.

103
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,250
How lucky.

104
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,600
Ji Hyeok asked his high school
senior to develop his app,

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,270
but he happened to be Deputy Lee's classmate.

106
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,340
So, I looked it up and found his website.

107
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,090
The office address was this cafe, too.

108
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,960
This cafe, Agit.

109
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,710
Hey, if he's running a business,

110
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,750
did he get compensated by that woman?

111
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,450
I think you're going too far.

112
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,830
Ji Hyeok isn't like that.

113
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,570
How can he open an office here, then?

114
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,360
I've known him for 14 years
since we were freshmen.

115
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,510
I don't know if he was compensated or not,

116
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,660
but he wouldn't happily start
an office here with that.

117
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,040
He must've had a different reason.

118
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,060
Hey, should we find out if that's really true?

119
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,320
Yes. Go ahead.

120
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,650
Okay, okay.

121
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,090
Hey.

122
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,550
Hey, Ji Eun Oh. You need to come with me.

123
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,440
You need to come and reveal the truth.

124
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,190
I'm working right now.

125
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,600
Hey, you and Ji Hyeok.

126
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,200
Isn't there something going on between you two?

127
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,440
Subaenim, don't cross the line.

128
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,070
You little.

129
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,130
You can't come in.

130
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,930
Hey, what year are you from?

131
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,910
Sunbaenim, this is a business establishment.

132
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,590
I know. Why don't you coax her and bring her out?

133
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,540
We can't go home because we're dying to find out.

134
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,940
Sunbaenim, we can wait for him all night.

135
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,050
No, but...

136
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,390
Come on. Seriously, Su Jeong.

137
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,170
Su Jeong, I'll step out for a second.

138
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,530
Okay.

139
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,670
 Ji Eun Oh, 

140
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,980
 who are you related to?
And why are you so shameless? 

141
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,680
 The money Dad spent on you. 

142
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,420
 Pay it back to me. 

143
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,530
 I can't live in the same house with her. 

144
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,080
 So, make a choice. Is it her or me? 

145
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,240
Hey, the lady who's looking down.

146
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,510
What are you doing here?

147
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,540
Isn't it obvious?

148
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,900
She's obviously bored. That's why.

149
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,330
Excuse me, do you want to drink with us?

150
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,610
- No, thanks.
- Sit, sit.

151
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,980
There isn't enough space.

152
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,540
You can sit on the ground, then.

153
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,860
Hey, hey. Let's go. Let's go.

154
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,870
What are you doing?

155
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,980
- Let go.
- Stop resisting.

156
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,290
Let's go over there, I said.

157
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,770
Let go. Let go!

158
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,980
What are you doing?

159
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,120
Who are you?

160
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm her dad. Why?

161
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,010
Dad.

162
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,060
What are you doing here this late?

163
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,570
What's with you guys?

164
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,400
What the hell!

165
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,360
A-Are you okay?

166
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,090
Why are you still here, Ahjussi?

167
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,500
I waited.

168
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,820
For what?

169
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,980
For you to stop crying.

170
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,440
Why do you keep talking like my dad?

171
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,580
You don't even know me.

172
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,170
I'm taking a bus here. How about you?

173
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,480
Well, I'm heading that way.

174
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,690
Thank you.

175
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,090
Okay. Get home safely.

176
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,830
She looked so happy and positive.

177
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,230
What's she so sad about?

178
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,850
It's gotten so late already.

179
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,150
 Eun Oh, I closed the cafe. I'm leaving. 

180
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,360
 I left the cash there. 

181
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,550
 

182
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,640
 Mom, I might work all night tonight. 

183
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,620
 Don't wait up for me. 

184
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,840
Done.

185
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,730
 I can't live in the same house with her. 

186
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,350
 So, make a choice. Is it her or me? 

187
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,430
 It's Eun Oh. 

188
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,180
 My daughter. 

189
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,970
 Tell Mom she can't see me again
unless she turns things back to normal. 

190
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,560
 Mom, you're still awake. 

191
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,130
 Hey, Eun Oh. 

192
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,280
 Eun Oh, Ji Hyeok said he won't come today. 

193
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,600
 He has a development meeting all night. 

194
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,260
I thought he wouldn't be sleeping here.

195
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,750
Who are you?

196
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,970
Who the hell are you!

197
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,280
Ji Eun Oh. Ji Eun Oh!

198
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,640
- Ji Eun Oh!
- I'm... I'm here.

199
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,020
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

200
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,120
I'm okay. You showed up at the right moment.

201
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,590
Are you stupid?

202
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,130
Can't you use your head?

203
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,910
Why did you stay while he came in?

204
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,510
You should've run away.

205
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,940
I thought it was you.

206
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,240
I thought you were using the back door
because you lost your key.

207
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,660
I see.

208
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,850
You saved me. Thank you.

209
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,030
Are you leaving now?

210
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,290
Of course, I should.

211
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,680
Choose one.

212
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,560
Go with a police officer or me.

213
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,320
I can't let you go alone.

214
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,170
Don't you have to finish up your meeting?

215
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,740
Thank God that meeting ended early.

216
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:15,900
 ♫ The moonlight shone on me ♫ 

217
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,970
 ♫ When I looked up in the sky, you ♫ 

218
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:29,280
 ♫ You, it was you ♫ 

219
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,200
 ♫ I try to ignore you ♫ 

220
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,280
 ♫ But my heart is always filled with you ♫ 

221
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,470
 ♫ I think it's always been you ♫ 

222
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,760
She keeps making me worry.

223
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,360
 

224
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,180
Hey, what are you doing?

225
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,330
There's a lot of beer left.
Why did you open a new bottles?

226
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,770
What are you, the owner?

227
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,930
I said my mom will bring money in about a week.

228
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,610
It's just some beer.

229
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,440
Seriously.

230
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,580
How long should I do this for?

231
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,440
She said it'll take a week.

232
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,630
The sooner, the better.

233
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,150
Okay.

234
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,230
Hold on.

235
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,170
It looks suspicious.

236
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,050
Do you want to carry it in,
or should we check it out together?

237
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,800
There's no one right now.

238
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,400
Isn't it normal for no one to be there?

239
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,840
It doesn't look like an explosive.

240
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,280
Do you want to open it?

241
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,240
It doesn't seem like anything.

242
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,770
 Celebrating our 500th day. 

243
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,600
 To my beloved Yeong Ra. 

244
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,700
This crazy bastard.

245
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,590
This is definitely a crazy bastard.

246
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,090
What are the police doing, exactly?

247
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,630
I told you.

248
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,610
The CCTV caught him entering
the area near the school.

249
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,020
But he suddenly disappeared.

250
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,130
What did Mr. Lee do while he was
taking photos so close to you?

251
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:51,400
He drove me around safely and cared for me.

252
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,720
If he did, how could he let these
photos be delivered?

253
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,080
Yeong Ra, have you noticed anything suspicious?

254
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,750
Not at all.

255
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,990
Mom, I don't want a new driver.

256
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,650
I'm scared of strangers.

257
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,970
I feel the safest around
Seong Jae's friend's brother.

258
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,350
I don't want a new driver.

259
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,550
Yeong Ra.

260
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,210
What are you talking about?

261
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,110
You tried to get her a new driver?

262
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,510
He was just helping us while we found
a new driver, to begin with.

263
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,510
He must have his career plans.

264
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,770
We can't ask him to keep helping us.

265
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,040
Can't we ask him?

266
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,250
We need to beg him.

267
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,090
Until we find out if this guy is
a sociopath or a psychopath,

268
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,330
we can't hire a new person. We can't trust anyone.

269
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,350
Yes, you're right.

270
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,800
But you should meet with the police chief.

271
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,460
You meet him personally. Show him this, please?

272
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,640
 

273
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,870
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

274
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,620
Try the right one.

275
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,630
Thank you.

276
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,580
Is it the right size?

277
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,600
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

278
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,440
I'm shopping for myself.
Could you recommend something to me?

279
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,420
These are the bestsellers.

280
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,570
 What's going on, Director? 

281
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,160
 I haven't seen you around lately. 

282
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,870
I've been too busy at work.

283
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,940
How's Eun Oh?

284
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,430
Did things get resolved with her brother?

285
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,000
Gang Oh did come back,
but it hasn't been resolved yet.

286
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,350
She must be stressed.

287
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,860
 The construction must've been going on, too. 

288
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,520
She will be at the cafe today.

289
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,060
There won't be construction for three days.

290
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,730
Did you get some sleep?

291
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,630
Have you eaten?

292
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,930
Thank you for last night.

293
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,830
I reported it to the police this morning.

294
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,070
Be careful until he gets caught.

295
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,510
Warn Su Jeong, too.

296
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,920
Warn?

297
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,440
Ji Hyeok is more caring than I thought.

298
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,250
He took care of everything at the police station.

299
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,740
He even warned us.

300
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,270
He's been working all night, too.

301
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,340
He always had a thoughtful side.

302
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,190
You're finally acknowledging it.

303
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,330
Because he did save me last night.

304
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,290
Oh, right. You can buy a used car now.

305
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,620
Well, the thing is...

306
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,380
Why didn't you get paid?

307
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,550
You took the coordinator job
because it paid 20 million.

308
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,650
You gave the money for the car to Gang Oh.

309
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,900
I didn't take it because of Gang Oh.

310
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,320
I felt like I shouldn't have any money.

311
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,760
If I got paid 20 million,

312
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,080
I felt like I'd give it to Gang Oh.

313
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,630
But if I did give him that money,

314
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,470
it'd feel like I'm admitting
that I'm not his real sister.

315
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,130
You could've taken the money and bought a car.

316
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,750
He demanded money for you
being raised by the family.

317
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,320
Gang Oh wasn't the only reason.

318
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,750
I found out Ji Hyeok's heart for
running the business is sincere.

319
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,900
How could I make him pay more than what I deserve?

320
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,070
I guess.

321
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,470
Knowing you, you'd never let him.

322
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,420
Let's go back in. We've been gone for too long.

323
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,700
Anyway, be careful at night.

324
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,440
What's this smell?

325
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,650
Smell?

326
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,330
I heard you haven't had lunch yet.

327
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,220
I haven't, either. Let's go out to eat.

328
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,580
It's not that I didn't get to eat. I chose not to.

329
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,320
What a fool. Why won't she eat with him?

330
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,860
He'll buy her something tasty.

331
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,670
Keep your promise to go out
for a movie with me, then.

332
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,830
A movie?

333
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,400
A movie?

334
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,580
 Eun Oh, 

335
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,670
 you need to take me to a movie. 

336
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,340
 You asked me to let you know
when Ji Hyeok breaks up 

337
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,430
 with his girlfriend. 

338
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,630
 Did they break up? 

339
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,010
Oh, right.

340
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,470
It's been a while, but you still promised.

341
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,010
I agree. When's a good time?

342
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:17,040
I have to work at the cafe
on the weekends, though.

343
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,810
How about in two days, when the cafe is closed?

344
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,400
You said there's no construction, either.

345
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,910
How about your work?

346
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,600
I can take a day off.

347
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,550
See you on Wednesday when the cafe is closed.

348
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,240
CEO Lee!

349
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,380
Hello.

350
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,600
- Hello.
- You came.

351
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,780
Min Woo, please toss this for me.

352
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,180
- Come this way, please.
- Okay.

353
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,580
The contract agreement,
proxy statement, plans, and...

354
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,810
the schedule adjustment agreement.

355
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,500
Here are the construction schedule requests.

356
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,900
Okay. What about the files for the units
with restrictive and flexible schedules?

357
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,130
- They're in the back.
- Oh, okay.

358
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,530
Five units haven't decided on the schedule yet.

359
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,440
They all work, and their kids are young.

360
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,600
They'd have to move twice.

361
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Yes. It will be a long-term construction.
How about the rest of them?

362
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,060
Most will store their things somewhere

363
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,990
and stay with parents, siblings,
or get a hotel, motel, or a sublet.

364
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,850
It varies.

365
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,900
Where's Eunoh-ism?

366
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,980
I'm here to meet Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

367
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,150
Hello. I'm Ji Eun Oh.

368
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,540
Come this way.

369
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,560
Is she a new client?

370
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,300
I own a six-story building, too.

371
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,370
I need to fix a few places there, too.

372
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,140
Why don't you take out the villa
design fee from that cost?

373
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,100
Pardon?

374
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,700
 

375
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,850
The wanted dates overlap too much.

376
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,810
 Since the construction fee is high, 

377
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,450
 7% of that is still a lot of profit for you. 

378
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,070
Your home is a multi-level 80-pyeong villa.

379
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,130
You want to change the layout a lot.

380
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,710
And you want two rooms on the second floor

381
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,210
and move the bathroom, too.

382
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,760
The layout will change completely.

383
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,320
The design fee is necessary in this case.

384
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,530
My daughter will live on the second floor.

385
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,640
I came here because she likes your designs.

386
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,730
And I said I'll give you more projects
once my store tenants move out.

387
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,370
No. That won't be necessary.

388
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,280
- Pardon?
- Find a different studio.

389
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,180
My gosh. She's too young to be so greedy.

390
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,790
Excuse me.

391
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,030
I'm saying I want to be paid for my labor.

392
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,250
If you want to renovate your home for free,

393
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,700
you need to DIY it.

394
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,430
Don't come to the wrong place and act rude.

395
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,200
I'm a precious child to my parents, too.

396
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,300
Please leave now.

397
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,350
You're working out of a cafe corner.
Don't be so proud.

398
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,120
You think it's so easy to make money?

399
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,380
 

400
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,000
Hey, Gyeong Hui.

401
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,610
I can't come this time.

402
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,580
Especially not today.

403
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,000
Wu Jin?

404
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,180
Wu Jin is here?

405
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,960
That's crazy. Why didn't he call me?

406
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,130
 He wanted to surprise you. 

407
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,890
I should go if Wu Jin is coming.

408
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,870
It's been forever.

409
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,360
Here are the documents you requested.

410
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,050
Thank you so much.

411
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,860
Ms. Kim, as soon as you come in tomorrow,

412
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,580
bring me all the shoes that Shoe Joy
produced since its first year to this year.

413
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,000
Okay. Got it.

414
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,360
 

415
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,840
How important is it that you
made me leave the house?

416
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,030
Something serious happened to Ji Eun Oh.

417
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,860
Her brother found out she was adopted.

418
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,600
So?

419
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,230
Her brother is currently refusing to come home.

420
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,510
He's reacting so negatively.

421
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,680
He's refusing to accept her as his sister.

422
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,430
He's refusing to accept it?

423
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,870
Sounds like a mess.

424
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,430
And from what we observed,

425
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,790
there are two men around Ms. Ji.

426
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,610
She's dating two men?

427
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,640
No. Neither of them is her boyfriend.

428
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,820
Why bring up men she's not even dating?

429
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,150
I'm not interested in her flings
unless they're boyfriends.

430
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,120
I forgot.

431
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,570
Your only flaw is that you overreact.

432
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,880
It's very transparent.

433
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,470
Only find out what I'm interested in.

434
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,460
I want accurate and detailed information.

435
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,460
Got it.

436
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,340
Continue.

437
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,990
Her and her mom's reaction, condition,
and the current situation.

438
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,020
 Cheers! 

439
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,860
Our taste in food couldn't be more different.

440
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,380
The taste in alcohol varies, too.

441
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,080
Soju, beer, somac, and wine.

442
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,230
And Min Seong, who doesn't drink.

443
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,990
If it weren't for the history group project
in March of our 10th grade,

444
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,870
we never would've become friends.

445
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,200
Our seats were far apart.

446
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,020
So were our numbers and clubs.

447
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,920
So are our hobbies.

448
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,920
Except for Wu Jin and me.

449
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,730
Thanks to the history teacher who
gave us the traditional house project

450
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,230
and also Ji Eun Oh.

451
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:20,240
 
Do you have to do this?

452
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,430
Will you just give it, or after I beat you?

453
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,020
Let's go. Let's just go.

454
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,300
- It's my dad's...
- It's not even that great.

455
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,700
- It belonged to my late dad.
- Okay, okay.

456
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,760
Please...

457
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,470
It's his late dad's belonging.

458
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,420
They're infamous bullies.

459
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,620
But still. It's 5:2.

460
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,120
So, what are you suggesting, Ji Eun Oh?

461
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,530
Hey, come on.

462
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,620
It's not that great...

463
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,410
Hurry up. Run, run!

464
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,260
Guys, guys!

465
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,900
Stop and run!

466
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,200
Run, run! Run!

467
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,530
Run, run, run!

468
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,630
 It felt like I was in a movie. 

469
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,800
 Me, too. Me, too. 

470
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,360
 Hey, you guys must remember it fondly. 

471
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,200
 You didn't lose hair like I did. 

472
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,870
- Pigtails?
- Yeah.

473
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,790
How did they know that we go here?

474
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,900
We weren't wearing uniforms.

475
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,370
One of them remembered Yeong In's curly pigtails

476
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,140
and red glasses.

477
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,740
His ex goes to our school, apparently.

478
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,480
Guys,

479
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,150
what do I do?

480
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:47,630
You said you've always had this
hairstyle since elementary school.

481
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,820
Let's use this opportunity to have a make-over.

482
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,040
I'm sure you'll look lovely.

483
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,680
Yeong In, it worked.

484
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,440
 Yeong In sacrificed her hair and saved us. 

485
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,610
 Yes, true, true. 

486
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,800
Yes. That's what I did.

487
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,120
Hey, hey. Let me ask Yeong In,
since she has a husband and a child now.

488
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,780
I've been dying to know.

489
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,200
Wu Jin, did you really break up
with Yeong In because of Eun Oh?

490
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,030
I'm telling you.

491
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,450
I said I didn't.

492
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,790
What are you talking about?

493
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,840
Wow. Wu Jin, I was your girlfriend,
but you were nicer to her.

494
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,460
And you gave Wu Jin your banana
whenever we got it for lunch.

495
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,020
Park Yeong In, do you know how much he cried

496
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,270
in front of me after you guys broke up?

497
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,870
- Really?
- Yes, I'm telling you.

498
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,600
I've always said we have a lot in common.

499
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,060
But you refused to believe me.

500
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,570
Hold on. Did I break up with Wu Jin because I was

501
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,160
jealous for no reason?

502
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Yes.

503
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,090
Hey, hey. We sorted things out.
Let's clank glasses.

504
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,110
Okay. Let's drink.

505
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,980
- There's no point in regretting now.
- Let me regret it.

506
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,430
 Cheers! 

507
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,240
Hey, this is the ladies' room.

508
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,480
I was waiting for you.

509
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,860
Why?

510
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,600
Ji Eun Oh, what's going on?

511
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,540
Huh?

512
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,820
Eun Oh.

513
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,100
Yes.

514
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,070
I knew I'd cry if I saw you again.

515
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,300
Gosh. That feels good.

516
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,710
I feel so relieved after crying my heart out.

517
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,910
Then, tell me.

518
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,970
Did you get rejected by your crush?

519
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,580
That man...

520
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,310
I confessed my love and got rejected.

521
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:42,270
Wu Jin, it turns out I had been blinded
by love like I had blackout curtains drawn.

522
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:47,680
Anyway, after feeling hatred,
disgust, and disappointment,

523
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,050
I removed him from my life.

524
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,070
You haven't, it seems.

525
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,850
I knew something was up as soon as I saw you.

526
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,630
It's not because of him.

527
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,200
Is it a family issue, then?

528
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,080
You wouldn't be struggling this much
unless it were a relationship or family issue.

529
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,500
My mom is healthy.

530
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,610
So is my brother.

531
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,080
You've been keeping a secret from me.

532
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,270
You can't even call it a secret.

533
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,540
It's not worth talking about.

534
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,780
Is it still?

535
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,720
Okay.

536
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,940
You'll overcome in a month at most.
Whatever it is.

537
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,080
You're like a spring for a reason.

538
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,240
Right. My nickname was Spring.

539
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,720
Because I bounce around all the time.

540
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,430
You've always been that way.

541
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,090
I'm sure you still are. You couldn't
have changed in just a year.

542
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,930
Right.

543
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,880
I'm me. I don't change easily.

544
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,700
By the way, you love your family too much.

545
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,700
You're too old to cry about your family.

546
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,950
Because I've been loved so much.

547
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,540
I know.

548
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,350
Your dad loved you very dearly.

549
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,080
He bought us pizza often, too.

550
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,750
Right.

551
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,590
He did that.

552
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,940
Dad was like that...

553
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,090
and I was like that.

554
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,210
What? Are you feeling better already?

555
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,030
Thanks to you.

556
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,780
You're the best, Han Wu Jin.

557
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,980
I've been recharged by Wu Jin.

558
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,740
I'm glad I came to Korea.

559
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,700
I know. Your family is rich.

560
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,220
Why would you spend summer
breaks in the US to work as an intern?

561
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,340
Don't you know I have no choice
but to do what I'm told?

562
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,160
- Did you say you're going back in two days?
- Yes.

563
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,870
It'd be too tough to meet one more time.

564
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,560
See you during the winter break, Eun Oh.

565
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,480
Okay.

566
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:23,600
Han Wu Jin, you have to call me
right away next time you come.

567
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,900
Taxi!

568
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,020
Su Bin, what are you doing here?

569
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,190
Didn't you call a taxi?

570
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,140
Let's get going.

571
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,490
You want me to drive you?

572
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,520
What's this?

573
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,090
I'm confessing my love.

574
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,980
Did someone confess to you?

575
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,460
No. I'm confessing to you. I'm asking you out.

576
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,050
 - Get out.
- Oppa. 

577
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,120
Get out first, Su Bin.

578
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,030
Oppa, listen to me first.

579
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,150
Get off first, and we'll talk.

580
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,830
You want to talk here?

581
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,700
What's this nonsense?

582
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,930
I've been thinking.

583
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,420
Oppa, don't we make a pretty nice couple?

584
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,290
Go out with me.

585
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,270
Gosh. Do you want to die?

586
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,260
Hey. You wanted me on your
channel for a reason, right?

587
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,580
Gosh. How could you be like this?

588
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,820
I thought of you differently while making videos.

589
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,360
You meet my standards, too.
That's why I'm asking you.

590
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,870
So? Do you like me?

591
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,280
I think I will once we start dating.

592
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,220
I told you. I'll be so good to you
once I start liking you.

593
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:24,040
But Su Bin, I don't go out
with a woman I don't like.

594
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:29,190
And there's someone I've liked for a long time.

595
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,300
Give me a break.

596
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,120
If you like someone, why aren't you dating her?

597
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,180
She'll definitely go out with you
if you ask her out.

598
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,350
Because I didn't let it show.

599
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:40,510
But I decided to from now on.

600
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:41,690
You're lying.

601
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,230
You decided the moment I asked you out?

602
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,780
Oppa, you're too old-fashioned.

603
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,860
You think I'll buy an excuse like that?

604
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,600
I don't lie to you.

605
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,460
You're Ji Hyeok's sister.

606
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,500
Geez. I told you to forget that I'm his sister.

607
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,880
I definitely said no. And I said
there's someone I like.

608
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,200
So, if you call me again for no reason,

609
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,950
I'll tell Ji Hyeok.

610
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,570
Gosh. You're so unbelievable.

611
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,560
You can get home by transferring
to a different bus once, right?

612
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,150
I waited three hours until you came out.

613
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,700
You won't even drive me home?

614
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,620
No. I won't.

615
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,970
The bus is here. Come. Let's go.

616
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,480
Oppa.

617
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,970
Oppa.

618
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,350
She's such a troublemaker.

619
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,140
I did a thousand.

620
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,960
Wow. I'm so jealous.

621
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,220
You folded a thousand already?

622
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,540
Yes.

623
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,780
I should stop for the day.

624
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,680
I'll get paid, pick up beef, and go home.

625
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,790
How much do you make a month?

626
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,690
Really?

627
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,350
Gosh. My goodness.

628
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,070
Gosh. You didn't have to.

629
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:50,650
It's okay. Our immune systems are weak.

630
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,630
We can't ignore even small wounds.

631
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,230
Give me your hand.

632
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,440
Gosh. It's okay, In-law.

633
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,850
Give me that. I'll do it.

634
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:02,790
Sit still.

635
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,920
Gosh. Seriously.

636
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,700
In-law,

637
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,270
how many friends do you see regularly?

638
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,140
I don't have any friends.

639
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,380
They're either dead or in nursing homes.

640
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,360
I don't have a single friend in Seoul, either.

641
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,130
There's one at a nursing home outside of Seoul.

642
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,450
One is in a wheelchair after a joint surgery.

643
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,240
I see them maybe once a year.

644
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,190
I see.

645
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:55,540
How did we end up living so long?

646
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,610
So, let's stop being in-laws. Let's be friends.

647
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,880
Friends?

648
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,260
We're turning 90 soon.

649
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,090
Don't be so formal for being in-laws.

650
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:15,300
Let's not feel uncomfortable at work, either.

651
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,210
Let's just be friends.

652
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,810
Forget about the word "In-law."

653
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:25,060
I know the times have changed a lot,

654
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,310
but would that be okay?

655
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,160
Yeong Hui.

656
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,650
Gosh, Da Jeong. What brings you here?

657
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:47,220
I was nearby to run an errand

658
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:51,080
and heard you work here. So, I stopped by.

659
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,480
What about the after-school
teaching job? Did you not get it?

660
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,600
I should've listened to you.

661
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,130
You worked until 50, but you
couldn't get an office job.

662
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,880
This isn't so bad.

663
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,420
Time passes fast since I keep moving.

664
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,170
- Really?
- Oh, right.

665
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:10,330
We do sales events here sometimes.

666
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,870
Do you want to try it for fun?

667
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,130
Sometimes you just need to work for three days.

668
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,610
Three days?

669
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:20,420
That doesn't sound bad.

670
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,310
Should I try it?

671
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,040
 Go out with me. 

672
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,920
 I'll become a successful YouTuber 

673
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,140
 and marry a man who's also rich. 

674
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,220
 I'll definitely get married. 

675
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,200
 That's why I joined a matchmaking service. 

676
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,980
Yes. I'll send you the adjusted schedule.

677
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,550
Let me know what you think.

678
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,500
A lot of requested dates overlapped.

679
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,600
I adjusted the construction schedule for now.

680
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,040
Please check and let me know.

681
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,930
Okay. Got it. Bye.

682
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,100
 

683
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,620
 

684
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,100
Hey.

685
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,490
Ji Hyeok, have lunch with me.
How about a sandwich?

686
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,770
With me? Why?

687
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:27,980
Let's eat at the cafe.

688
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,850
 Your favorite place. 

689
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:33,570
Can't you go out to get sun with me?

690
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,760
I'll pick up the sandwiches.

691
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,250
Okay.

692
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,550
Are you making good use of the fund?

693
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,840
Putting into use all the time.

694
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:58,780
Let's contact your family, then.

695
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,190
Why do you find it so hard?

696
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,080
You know they aren't still upset about it.

697
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,460
I'm the one who's upset.

698
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,250
You? Why are you upset?

699
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,320
Don't you know?

700
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,560
I guess you're asking since you don't know.

701
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,230
Geez. Don't be so cryptic now.

702
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:26,200
Why am I upset with my father?

703
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,420
Because he didn't let me do what I enjoy.

704
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:36,420
What do you mean by that?

705
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,280
Do you remember, Seong Jae?

706
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,180
What we planned to do in the US?

707
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,830
Hey, man. You wanted to be roommates with me.

708
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,800
You said you'll go to the same college as me.

709
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:53,320
Yes. You're right.

710
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,120
I was going to study architecture at Cornell.

711
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,500
That's why you went to Cornell.

712
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,970
Right.

713
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:04,110
When you learned you couldn't go,

714
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,310
I was sick for days.

715
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,080
It must've been hard waiting.

716
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,860
 
Of course, I should wait.

717
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:22,430
I've been thinking about it seriously
for a month, Ji Hyeok.

718
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,400
I'll save up until you're in 12th grade

719
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,570
and I'll let you study in the US.

720
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,460
Dad, do you mean it?

721
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:36,510
But you have to do the military
service after the freshman year.

722
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,510
That way, I can save up more for two years.

723
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:43,930
It turns out there are many
scholarship programs, too.

724
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:47,740
Thank you, Dad. Thank you.

725
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,280
I'll make sure to become the
world's biggest architect.

726
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,330
I'll work part-time jobs
while I'm on military leave, too.

727
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,400
 

728
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,600
Shi Seung, hit your dense head. Not the innocent desk.

729
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,680
Why don't I have a dream like Ji Hyeok?

730
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,580
I know. I'm most jealous of Ji Hyeok.

731
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,280
His dream was to become an architect
since he was in 9th grade.

732
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,870
Since 9th grade.

733
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,500
In 10th grade, he decided to study abroad, too.

734
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,610
Yes. Our dream is to go to college.

735
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:24,610
But he already decided on his future.

736
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,940
It's not that easy to prepare for all that.

737
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,470
Gosh, so annoying.

738
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,410
Seong Jae.

739
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,820
I'm sorry, Seong Jae. I need to run.

740
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,400
I'm running late for my drawing class.

741
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,390
Ji Hyeok,

742
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,840
your father is here.

743
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,420
My father?

744
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,690
Dad!

745
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:53,010
What do you mean, Dad?

746
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,970
I can't study abroad?

747
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,280
Grandpa was sent to the hospital this morning.

748
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,330
He had an abdominal aneurysm.

749
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:05,440
It was torn by 8 cm. He got surgery.

750
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,610
Okay. But what does that have to do
with my study abroad?

751
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:17,620
During the CT scan, they discovered
he has kidney cancer.

752
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,230
They can't operate on him back-to-back.

753
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:23,330
So, he needs to take medication,

754
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:27,180
but it costs millions of won per month.

755
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,750
So, I have to spend your education fund.

756
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,080
How's that fair?

757
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,780
What do you mean? His life depends on this.

758
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,220
I know, but...

759
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,320
is there really no way?

760
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,260
What about me, Dad?

761
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:50,170
You can go to college here.

762
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,810
You said you want to become an architect.

763
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,970
Do you have to go to the US for that?

764
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,500
I'm in 12th grade now.

765
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,900
Okay. Forget about it.

766
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,890
Hey, Ji... Ji Hyeok...

767
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,980
Ji...

768
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,790
It's raining. He doesn't have an umbrella.

769
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,340
How is this fair?

770
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,970
You promised to let me study abroad.

771
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,610
You promised me when I was
in 10th grade. I'm in 12th grade now.

772
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,710
You only care about Grandpa.

773
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,550
You care about him more than me.

774
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,970
I mean nothing to you!

775
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,160
 That's when I finally saw it. 

776
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,120
 Ever since Grandpa got ill, 

777
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,040
 my siblings and I lived that way for 30 years. 

778
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,560
I could see my future, too.

779
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,630
I gave up on studying abroad
and architecture at that moment.

780
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:46,170
I didn't know that had happened to you.

781
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:50,460
I was denied my dream then.

782
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,840
It wasn't anyone's fault. I couldn't blame anyone.

783
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,900
But I felt like my dream had been denied.

784
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,080
I knew you were having a hard time.

785
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,410
But I thought you accepted it quickly.

786
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:15,440
One can't always say everything.

787
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,170
 There's something you can't talk about. 

788
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,690
 There was... 

789
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:26,060
 between us, too. 

790
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,000
Between us, too.

791
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,620
But I'm having fun these days.

792
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:37,440
Really?

793
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,500
Yes.

794
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:44,600
I feel like I kind of understand
why Ji Eun Oh was like that then.

795
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:48,490
By the way, you and Eun Oh...

796
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,560
Never mind.

797
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,960
Exactly like this house.

798
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,660
Just make it exactly like this.

799
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,480
You don't have any particular requests?

800
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,650
You're telling me to just copy this.

801
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,630
- She keeps getting inquiries.
- How about you change the details?

802
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,420
- Su Jeong.
- Yes?

803
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:32,540
No one will be here when the
cafe closes, right? Not even you.

804
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,910
No. Of course, I won't be here.

805
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,500
Eun Oh won't be here since she made
a plan with the Director.

806
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,450
I've been pushing off coordinator interviews.

807
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:45,680
I'm thinking of interviewing
about 30 people that day.

808
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,080
Thirty people a day?

809
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:52,370
I suppose you have 29 projects
for that group construction.

810
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,030
I'll schedule them that day, then.

811
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,400
Okay.

812
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,050
There are construction details, too.

813
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:08,070
If you do it exactly like this, I'll sign now.

814
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,970
This is Ji Eun Oh.

815
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,420
 

816
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,000
 

817
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,860
 

818
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,420
Turnkey...

819
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,820
 

820
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:56,070
 

821
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,680
Let's talk.

822
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,000
I'm busy right now.

823
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,530
We still should.

824
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,910
I'm working overtime. What are you doing?

825
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:33,460
Let's become business partners.

826
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:35,470
You and I. The two of us.

827
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:04,660
 ♫ Your bright presence shines in the dark night ♫ 

828
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:12,850
 ♫ As blindingly bright as the stars ♫ 

829
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:20,700
 ♫ After a long time passed ♫ 

830
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:23,310
 I knew it was you. 

831
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,380
 Where's Ji Hyeok? I said where's Ji Hyeok? 

832
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,970
 You received an investment now. 

833
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,900
 When will you get a new office? 

834
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,180
 Hey, Lee Ji Hyeok. 

835
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,600
 What's with that dress? 

836
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,870
 She's dressed for a date. 

837
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:36,480
 Since when? Since when did you
and Seong Jae become so close? 

838
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,180
 How? While talking crap about me? 

839
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,730
 Oppa, go on 10 dates with me. 

840
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,010
 You're forcing me to say this. 

841
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:44,220
 Su Bin, I... 

842
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,550
 What? 

843
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:48,000
 My secret that I've been hiding. 

844
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,240
 I have a daughter whom I lost.
