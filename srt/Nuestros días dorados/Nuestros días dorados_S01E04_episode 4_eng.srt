1
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,970
Marry me, Ji Hyeok.

2
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,700
What?

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,500
I'm asking you to marry me.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,980
Why are you doing this?

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,720
Do you think I don't know that

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,820
you've openly declared that
you're anti-marriage and

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,630
still asking you to marry me?

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,680
I don't want to respond because this is so absurd.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,410
Stop talking nonsense and

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,300
finish your thought if you have something to say.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,700
I'll listen and show reactions.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,330
You know I've been in love.

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,760
A dead serious one.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,770
I said I'll never forget him. No...

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,610
I decided I'd be with him until I die.

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,920
That's how much I loved him.

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,450
I'd run to him now if only I knew where he was.

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,790
That's how much lingering feelings
I had for that relationship.

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,880
But you don't end up together just
because you're in love.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,000
As you already know.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,590
I need to give up since he's gone,

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,690
but I can't give up on the
privilege my dad gives me.

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,060
I think you are anti-marriage

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,100
because you'd lose more than you gain

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,050
through a marriage.

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,240
Are you done?

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,770
I agree with you.

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,420
I've learned that love doesn't lead to marriage.

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,560
That's why I'm making a suggestion.

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,990
Why shouldn't you marry if you earn a lot from it?

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,540
I'm not suggesting we become
a perfect, lovely couple.

32
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,760
But still…

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,240
Are you anti-marriage because you
thought you'd never meet your love?

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,340
That's not it.

35
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,790
Why shouldn't you have a loveless marriage, then?

36
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,540
Not only that, you'll never love anyone.

37
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,530
You said you can control your emotions.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,750
What would I gain

39
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,730
by marrying you right now?

40
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,750
Should I start negotiating or something?

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm the only daughter of Haneul Construction.

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,120
My father, CEO Jeong Ho Yeong

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,530
believes that a woman should never run the company.

44
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,060
You know that already.

45
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,840
There was a rumor like that going around.

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,440
And you never know.

47
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,490
If we grow attached to each other, we'll agree

48
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,720
to become a real couple.

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,900
Or...

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,960
we'll get divorced after my dad passes away.

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,690
Well, although I don't know when.

52
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,960
Aren't you laying your cards too much?

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,780
You understand that I'm not joking.

54
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,050
Give it a thought, then.

55
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,310
See you back here next week.

56
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,260
 

57
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,780
What a strange world.

58
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,860
Yes, Father.

59
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,140
 Yes, Ji Hyeok. 

60
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,270
 Do you have a plan after work today? 

61
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,850
 Did you know? 

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,090
No, I have no plans.

63
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,910
 Let's meet outside after you're off work. 

64
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,790
Where should I meet you?

65
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,250
How about Yeong Bo's shop?

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,570
- Hey.
- Let me do it.

67
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,130
Don't take this fun away from me.

68
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,310
I haven't drunk with someone in a while.

69
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,810
You're right.

70
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,530
Here.

71
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,950
Wow, I'm jealous.

72
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,140
Having a son to drink with.

73
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,460
Mr. Choi has late-stage cancer.

74
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,630
That's why that happened.

75
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,910
Oh, I see.

76
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,400
His son is young.

77
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,190
That's why he thinks differently from his father.

78
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,480
But he was acting cocky, so I chewed him out.

79
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,970
Yes.

80
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,040
I've been meeting with people in the industry.

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,980
I'll get a job soon.

82
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,240
I was going to explain the situation later.

83
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,480
Okay.

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,900
Do Ji Wan and Su Bin know?

85
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,410
Not yet.

86
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,570
But you should tell them as soon as possible.

87
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,590
No, I'll get a job first.

88
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,280
There's no need to disappoint the kids.

89
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,940
Because you don't know when that will be.

90
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,200
What?

91
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,710
It's not easy to get a job after you retire.

92
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,010
Be prepared for that.

93
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,530
That's how it is after you retire.

94
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,330
It's just reality.

95
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,020
Yes.

96
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,300
It's not easy. It must be hard.

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,780
But it's not like I don't know that.

98
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,260
I have friends who retired before I did

99
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,120
and a ton of them work outside
when it's freezing cold.

100
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,690
But still, I got recruited even before I retired.

101
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,360
There has to be a reason why.

102
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,800
I'll let the kids know.

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,480
It must be hard for Mom and
Grandma to pretend, too.

104
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,630
Don't act like you know.

105
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,810
Don't tell Ji Wan and Su Bin.

106
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,920
Don't let Mom and Grandma know, either.

107
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,940
It shouldn't be a secret, Father.

108
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,220
A lot of people go through this.

109
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,590
 We can only leap so far. 

110
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,700
Don't assume your father will end up the same way.

111
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,900
We're not in a position to worry
about living expenses.

112
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,620
You have a good job.

113
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,400
Ji Wan doesn't ask for money.

114
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,110
We just need to help Su Bin.
What's there to worry about?

115
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,300
It'll only take two or three months.

116
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,730
What kind of work are you thinking of?

117
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,470
Textiles. What else?

118
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,190
Don't just look at textiles. Broaden your search.

119
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,710
You little.

120
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,070
I can manage that myself.

121
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,410
Where do you spend time outside?

122
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,880
What do you mean by where?

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm busy meeting people in the
industry to look for a job.

124
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,120
I go hiking and play pool sometimes, too.

125
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,850
I meet my college buddies, too.

126
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,910
Okay.

127
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,570
Aigoo. How long has it been
since I walked with you like this?

128
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,830
It's been a long time.

129
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,150
Hey,

130
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,820
why am I looking up at you like this?

131
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,420
I looked down at you like this just yesterday.

132
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,980
That was ages ago.

133
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,920
I've been taller than you for a million years.

134
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,560
Is that so?

135
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,290
You're tall. Yes.

136
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,070
Of course. I'm your son.

137
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,290
 Let me leave now. 

138
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,400
 I need to run a bit. 

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,220
 If you can't hide your discomfort, 

140
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,360
 quit your job as a manager at our cafe. 

141
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,390
 All right, Lee Ji Hyeok. 

142
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,050
 I'll forget everything. 

143
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,300
 I'll move on completely. 

144
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,330
 I've already thought about this. 

145
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,390
 You think I haven't? 

146
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,670
 Why am I incompatible with you? 

147
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,350
 Because I'm not feminine? 

148
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,080
 Because I don't adorn myself? 

149
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,730
 Because I have too strong a personality? 

150
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,830
 Because we have different tastes? 

151
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,950
 It was none of those. 

152
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,120
 The only thing would be our backgrounds. 

153
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,910
 Because my family is poor? 

154
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,710
 Because I don't make enough money? 

155
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,110
 It's definitely not that. 

156
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,360
 Because you're anti-marriage. 

157
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,640
 You wouldn't care about that
since you won't marry. 

158
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,960
 What is it, then? 

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,900
 I don't know why you won't tell me, but... 

160
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,650
 

161
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,430
No.

162
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,980
I won't console myself with alcohol.

163
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,250
I can overcome this alone.

164
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,300
There's leftover ginseng wine
from the memorial service.

165
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,510
I saw Kang Oh making a highball with it.

166
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,310
Gosh, seriously...

167
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,030
My head hurts.

168
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,400
I'm dying. Seriously.

169
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,300
- Isn't that your sister?
- I think so.

170
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,190
Gosh, ouch!

171
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,110
Eun Oh.

172
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,340
- Eun Oh!
- Ji Eun Oh!

173
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,650
My goodness. Eun Oh!

174
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,400
 By the way, Da Jeong... 

175
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,520
when people say, "Elders are welcome,"

176
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,230
how old do they expect you to be?

177
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,240
Who welcomes elders?

178
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,310
Well, I saw it at a restaurant or something.

179
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,680
They said that in a job poster.

180
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,200
Probably 65, then.

181
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,410
The subway is free starting at that age.

182
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,280
Sixty-five?

183
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,680
That's a baby's age compared to you.

184
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,770
Sixty-five definitely is.

185
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,800
How hungover is she that
you even brought in Hye Na?

186
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,170
She was in a hospital all night.

187
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,110
Not knowing she mixed alcohol,

188
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,520
they thought she took poison
since she was passed out.

189
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,810
They even pumped her stomach.

190
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,520
With exhaustion and the flu,

191
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,250
she needs to rest for about a week.

192
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,090
 Ji Hyeok, I think Eun Oh is very sick. 

193
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,580
 She was sent to the hospital. 

194
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,000
 

195
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,104
So?

196
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:06,120
What?

197
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,080
I saw your text about Eun Oh.

198
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,970
How is she now?

199
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,170
She's resting at home now.

200
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,300
That's good, then.

201
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,000
- I'll hang up.
 - Hey. 

202
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,140
 Yes, Director. 

203
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,890
Please call Yurim Traditional Clinic.

204
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,900
 

205
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,990
Goodness.

206
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,250
Eun Oh...

207
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,600
someone sent you expensive traditional medicine.

208
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,450
My gosh. There's fruit and tea, too.

209
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,050
It's filled with snacks, too.

210
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,510
Park Seong Jae.

211
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,400
Who's this?

212
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,660
 I hope you feel better soon. 

213
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,690
He's a regular.

214
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,770
You sure are lucky with food.

215
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,450
A new bakery sent you bread, too.

216
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,060
How did they know you love bread?

217
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,350
You eat it.

218
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,730
Really? Thank you.

219
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,330
Gosh, stop.

220
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,640
Eat whatever she doesn't want.

221
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,070
Eun Oh, since you had porridge,

222
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,020
pick a bread you want and have some

223
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,630
when you have an appetite.

224
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,240
Get up.

225
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,410
Pick one.

226
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,140
My goodness.

227
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,800
It's yeontanbbang and agungbbang.

228
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,630
They mean serious business these days.
They promote like crazy.

229
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,260
"I hope the deep scent of sweetness comforts you."

230
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,390
I got the chills.

231
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,640
Take them.

232
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,000
Mr. Lee, my knees hurt too much.

233
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,760
Well, your feet are pointing forward.

234
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,430
Make them point off to the side more.

235
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,750
The width should be shoulder width

236
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,270
and you go down like that.

237
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,730
When you squat, try to fold the hip joints.

238
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,220
Get up by using the glutes and thigh muscles.

239
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,910
Which part is the glutes?

240
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,370
Well, the glutes are...

241
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,090
Right here?

242
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,190
What?

243
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,020
What are you doing?

244
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,150
I'm sorry, Director.

245
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,850
Hey.

246
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,110
Your girlfriend wasn't even watching,
but to be loyal to her,

247
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,960
you refused to have female clients.

248
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,380
And you refuse to lay a finger on them.

249
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,950
How will you be a personal trainer?

250
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,020
It's not because of my girlfriend.
It's just me, sir.

251
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,400
So, pack your stuff.

252
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,570
I have my clients. How could I-

253
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,390
Call the Labor Department if you think it's unfair.

254
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,370
Never mind. I'll pack my stuff.

255
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,760
Why did I buy you?

256
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,150
 ♫ It's okay not to tell me ♫ 

257
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,600
 ♫ Lean on me and close your eyes ♫ 

258
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,100
 ♫ And you'll feel better ♫ 

259
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,910
 ♫ It's okay to rest sometimes ♫ 

260
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,970
 ♫ You've been working hard ♫ 

261
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,210
 ♫ It's okay to pause for a moment ♫ 

262
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,990
 

263
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,180
 ♫ A tiring day has passed ♫ 

264
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,200
 ♫ Yet in the same spot ♫ 

265
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,800
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

266
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,950
 ♫ Just saying, "Thank you for your hard work" ♫ 

267
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,100
 I want to be alone for a while. 

268
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,880
 I'll be in touch. 

269
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,710
What do you think? This is
a refreshing early summer look.

270
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,930
Sleeveless shirts are only for mid-summer?

271
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,600
No, no.

272
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,360
True fashionistas...

273
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,220
are ahead of season.

274
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,490
Cut. Okay.

275
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,580
I'm cold. I'm cold.

276
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,550
Gosh, so cold.

277
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,930
It's too cold right now.

278
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,330
I said we should film once it warms up.

279
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,250
You got goosebumps.

280
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,850
I'm okay. I can shave off goosebumps if I have to.

281
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,190
I have to gain subscribers.

282
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll never be humiliated like that again.

283
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,260
If you gain 7-80,000 subscribers

284
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,140
and marry a rich man,

285
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,310
what about me? What happens to me?

286
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,860
Hey, Lee Ha Eun.

287
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,690
Are you really my friend?

288
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,800
You think I'm doing this to marry a rich man?

289
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,140
Why did you join a dating
service, then? We're only 24.

290
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,590
That's because they have a lot of rich men and...

291
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,980
Men like young and pretty women.

292
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,680
That's what I was saying.

293
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,000
No.

294
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,230
I won't marry a man who's just rich.

295
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,080
I'll marry a man who's rich
on top of everything else.

296
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,650
To do so, I need to be someone.

297
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,120
Other than being pretty, young,
and having a nice body.

298
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,600
So, don't worry and focus on the channel.

299
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,830
I'll make sure to get a million subscribers.

300
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,130
Okay.

301
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,680
I'll go get changed.

302
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,900
 

303
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,550
 

304
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,580
What's my in-law doing in this neighborhood?

305
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,300
We need to hurry. That place has a long wait.

306
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,470
 Hello, Mr. Lee Ji Hyeok. 

307
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,550
 Congratulations on being hired
as a deputy at SSP Company. 

308
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,820
Of course.

309
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,330
I'm a deputy again.

310
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,260
Geez.

311
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,140
It scared me. Seriously.

312
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,860
Should I go home?

313
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,090
Ji Wan, why did you come home so early?

314
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,950
Well, my client canceled on me.

315
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,910
If you work out in that posture,

316
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,250
you won't get glutes.
Your front thighs will get thick.

317
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,610
Don't hit me.

318
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:25,500
Why are you suddenly doing weight training?

319
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,270
Ji Wan, you said you can train me
for free at your gym, right?

320
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,000
I want to be your client starting tomorrow.

321
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,660
Oh, yeah...

322
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,280
The thing is...

323
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,320
Ji Wan, by chance...

324
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,540
did you quit again?

325
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,490
Hey, what's wrong with these ahjummas?

326
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:52,050
I was going to ask you to give Mom
some money starting next month.

327
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:56,250
Why? W-Why should I?

328
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,880
Seongil Textile canceled the job offer to Dad.

329
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,470
Canceled?

330
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,750
But without being able to tell us,

331
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,990
Dad goes out looking for a job every day.

332
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,650
Don't tell them I was home, Su Bin.

333
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,870
It's one thing after another.

334
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,530
Our family is in trouble.

335
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:25,590
Geez. Ji Hyeok is the only normal person.

336
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,000
What do I do?

337
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,130
I need to make a lease payment for this car, too.

338
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,590
I can't borrow from Mom.

339
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,470
Lee Ji Wan, you crazy bastard.

340
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,450
You leased it because you got seduced by a vixen.

341
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,230
How dare you try to borrow money?

342
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,890
When Father is jobless now?

343
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,030
If I get a call from anywhere I applied to,

344
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,360
I'll work there, no matter what.

345
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
Got it?

346
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,530
Nod.

347
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,480
 

348
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,410
Huh? Ji Hyeok sent me a million.

349
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,316
 

350
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,550
 Yes, Mother. 

351
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,480
Hey, Ji Hyeok. I think you sent the wrong amount.

352
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,750
 I received a million won. 

353
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,670
It wasn't a mistake.

354
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,240
No?

355
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,500
Why did you send 500,000 more?

356
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,010
Just because.

357
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,580
What do you mean?

358
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,430
I know Father's job offer was canceled.

359
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,260
Gosh, did you know?

360
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,470
How did you know?

361
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,100
Just by chance.

362
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,070
Use it for living expenses until he finds a job.

363
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,880
No, you don't have to.

364
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,980
It's because I don't feel good, Mom.

365
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,310
Talk to you later.

366
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,510
O-Okay, then.

367
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,390
How did he know?

368
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,010
It feels so strange.

369
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,410
No, I feel better.

370
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,580
What do you feel better about?

371
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,800
Gosh. You came home early.

372
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,550
What do you feel better about

373
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,380
but then you're so stunned to see me?

374
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,260
T-The thing is...

375
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,770
Father.

376
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,520
We need to talk.

377
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,670
Hey.

378
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,070
Why are you so careless?

379
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,390
I told you to play ignorant because

380
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,260
I'll get a job in a few months.

381
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,430
Why won't you listen to me?

382
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,630
I have my situation, too.

383
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,450
What about your situation?

384
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,500
I didn't ask you to worry about living expenses.

385
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,820
I'm the father. I'm the breadwinner.

386
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,737
I didn't give it to her because of you.

387
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,780
What?

388
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,640
I gave her extra so Mom doesn't feel anxious.

389
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,040
I didn't feel at ease.

390
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,900
I don't like seeing her acting fine in front of me.

391
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,600
You disobeyed me because you felt uncomfortable?

392
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,980
Because of your pride, should Grandma, Mom, I,

393
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,430
and even you pretend to be happy?

394
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,170
As if you still have a job lined up?

395
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,910
I believe that you will...

396
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,510
get a job.

397
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,340
But it might take a long time.

398
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,540
A lot longer than you think.

399
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,590
And it's not so unusual that
they canceled the job offer.

400
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,520
Don't you know what the world is like?

401
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,920
It can happen to anyone

402
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,126
and you were just unlucky.

403
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:10,640
So...

404
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,530
you don't have to make us feel uncomfortable.

405
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,970
You bastard.

406
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,440
I'll call you when it's ready.

407
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,980
Okay.

408
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,050
Are you really okay?

409
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,200
I told you to rest for a few more days.

410
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,610
I'm okay. I'm okay. Times 100.

411
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,750
Okay? I was so bored.

412
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,720
You suffered enough to drink yourself to death.

413
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,450
I just flipped out to get over it.

414
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,180
So, did it work?

415
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,980
Are you saying you feel better now?

416
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,990
I'll be fine because I found out the reason.

417
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,080
What reason?

418
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,330
The reason I felt so shocked and

419
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,660
flustered after I got rejected by him.

420
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,940
Why? Why did you?

421
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,480
Su Jeong,

422
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,450
did Ji Hyeok not come by today, either?

423
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:37,010
He didn't come. Instead...

424
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,900
Eun Oh.

425
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,400
 I... 

426
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,770
believed he'd give me a chance
even if he rejected me.

427
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,440
So,

428
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,210
I never thought about what'd happen next.

429
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,200
"What do I do if he rejects me?"

430
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,690
I didn't think that.

431
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:12,160
I just wanted to tell him how I feel.

432
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:18,290
You trusted Ji Hyeok.

433
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,230
I guess so. How silly of me.

434
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,210
I was mistaken.

435
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,750
That's why I wasn't sure what to do

436
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,470
and felt confused after he rejected me.

437
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,920
That's why I behaved so tackily.

438
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,830
I embarrassed myself, too.

439
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,470
How about now, then?

440
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,410
I accepted it and gave up.

441
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,360
I'll try my best.

442
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,910
Because we have to go back to the way we were.

443
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,850
Can you?

444
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,550
I have to.

445
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,250
Because I brought all this on myself.

446
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,550
I shouldn't say it's a relief,

447
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,960
but it's still a relief.

448
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,290
Yes.

449
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,720
I'll visit a cafe I worked on recently.

450
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,490
- You're done, right?
- Yes.

451
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,480
There's something I'm curious about, Director.

452
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,030
Why did you ask me about Ji Hyeok 
this entire week?

453
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,290
Doesn't he answer his phone? Did you fight?

454
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,680
Is something going on with him?

455
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,210
There's something I'm a bit worried about.

456
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,610
What is it?

457
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,630
It's not something I should talk about.

458
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,190
Director, by chance,

459
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,200
do you like Ji Hyeok?

460
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,460
- Is that why you're still single?
- Hey.

461
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,250
J-Ji Hyeok?

462
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,300
He's...

463
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,840
my second favorite person in the world.

464
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,820
Without a girlfriend,
but second favorite after parents...

465
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,070
He was like a stream of water
when I was withering away.

466
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,800
He was on my side for the first time.

467
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,280
Did you have such a significant history?

468
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,000
Hey.

469
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,610
Why are you coming out of the back gate today?

470
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,530
Seong Jae, I told you not to do this.

471
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,990
You don't have to be scared of us.

472
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,030
You wore new sneakers to give me today.

473
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,870
Why would we bother you?

474
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,040
 Seong Jae. 

475
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,040
Wear these.

476
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,900
They're limited-edition sneakers.

477
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,010
Aren't they pretty?

478
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,490
I prefer wearing these.

479
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,580
What are you talking about?

480
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,700
I can't stand you wearing shoes like those.

481
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,600
Just because yours got switched,

482
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,000
you can't keep wearing those old shoes.

483
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,810
Father will be mad if he notices them.

484
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,630
I won't tell him that you
lost your shoes a few times.

485
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,200
It's a secret.

486
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,500
Here. Wear these.

487
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,610
No, no.

488
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,960
What do you mean, no?

489
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,770
Hey. Stand him up.

490
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,210
Park Seong Jae, take the shoes off yourself.

491
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,680
Hey!

492
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,200
Enough is enough.

493
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,660
You make him deliver bread, give you his sneakers,

494
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,800
and you take his money every Monday.
Isn't that enough?

495
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,270
Wow. The bookworm Lee Ji Hyeok knows how to talk.

496
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,830
He's in my class, and I'm the class president.

497
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,740
You're the class president in school.

498
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,560
You want to be the neighborhood president, too?

499
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,660
- Kick him.
- You're so cool, Dae Yong!

500
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,150
What?

501
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,490
You can't fight alone?

502
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,280
What?

503
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,550
Fight one-on-one if you will.

504
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,800
You cowardly bastard, Go Dae Yong.

505
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,400
- You can't handle me alone, right?
- Lee Ji Hyeok, you...

506
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,380
- Did you catch a brain virus?
- Answer me.

507
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,950
One-on-one.

508
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,500
 Lee Ji Hyeok, don't regret it
even if you die. I'll pulverize you. 

509
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,980
 Don't bother Seong Jae again if I defeat you. 

510
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,760
Go easy.

511
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,550
Nice.

512
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,430
What the.

513
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,230
Stop!

514
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,750
No!

515
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,900
Hey, let go... hey...

516
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,600
Hey, Go Dae Yong!

517
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,260
Hey, hey, wake up.

518
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,600
What's going on?

519
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,510
It's not fun. Let's go.

520
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,980
Hey, get up. What's with you?

521
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,070
You saw that, right?

522
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,860
You can't bully Park Seong Jae anymore.

523
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,550
 Shut up now. 

524
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,500
You didn't get beaten up.

525
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,460
He was a good person back then, too.

526
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,510
Why did you let them bully you?

527
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,490
Were you scared?

528
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,530
Well, probably. I think so.

529
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,710
I need to get going.

530
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,600
 

531
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,850
 This is so you don't worry. Eun Oh came to work. 

532
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,430
Punk...

533
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,530
I'm glad.

534
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,140
Gosh, you shouldn't have brought this.

535
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,470
Congratulations on the opening.

536
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,530
Thank you.

537
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,630
This space was a hit.

538
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,250
- Oh, really?
- People take photos here to post online...

539
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,640
I thought the wheels looked familiar.

540
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,290
I heard you were sick.

541
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,010
I knew that would happen.

542
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,400
I told you to take care of yourself.

543
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,390
You're annoying.

544
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,280
I kind of am.

545
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,410
Are you feeling okay?

546
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,490
I'm better than before because I rested plenty.

547
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,410
Where are you coming from?

548
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,170
The cafe I built opened.

549
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,050
I stopped by to deliver an opening
gift and check for flaws.

550
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,970
Do you have a new project?

551
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,520
Not yet.

552
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,560
Right. The students sent me an email.

553
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,070
For the 30th anniversary,

554
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,440
they came up with 30 items.

555
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,430
Don't they have classes and exams?

556
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,030
Will they only attend club events all semester?

557
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,870
Why are they so obsessed with the club?

558
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,980
You were like that in college, too.

559
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:00,380
It's because I was going
to switch to interior design.

560
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,930
They want to work on two houses this time.

561
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,340
During the entire summer vacation.

562
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,600
I can make a plan for them,

563
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,370
but they'll have to beg the sunbaes
in technical fields, right?

564
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,540
Eun Oh.

565
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,290
Don't try too hard.

566
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,160
What?

567
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,240
You don't have to try so hard to talk.

568
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,700
I've always been chatty going somewhere with you.

569
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,720
Not this much.

570
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,470
You used to catch a breath.

571
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,570
D-Did I?

572
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,400
But you're really annoying sometimes.

573
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,580
You're too honest.

574
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,380
Not always.

575
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm usually honest,

576
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,470
but sometimes I pretend to be. Pretty often.

577
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,980
When do you pretend to be honest?

578
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,040
When I need to, when I feel uncomfortable,

579
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,230
and when I feel gutless?

580
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,500
I guess you can't help it, either.

581
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,320
Everyone is like that.

582
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,290
You think anyone's special? You fool.

583
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,140
Go inside.

584
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,100
I thought you were going to the cafe.

585
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,140
Seong Jae told me that you returned to work.

586
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,100
So, I stopped by briefly.

587
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,520
When you date from now on,

588
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,490
meet someone nice, not someone you like.

589
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,390
Liking someone is based on feelings.

590
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,110
Those feelings...

591
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,230
don't have much power.

592
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,360
That was pretty cool advice.

593
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,740
Eat well. You look thin.

594
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,060
Okay.

595
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,440
Take care, Sunbae.

596
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:42,220
 ♫ I take a step forward slowly,
hoping to reach you ♫ 

597
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,200
Would you like to order?

598
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,180
Actually, are you the designer of this portfolio?

599
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,150
Well, no. It's not mine.

600
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,130
There she is. It's hers.

601
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,050
By chance...

602
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,770
Hello. Are you feeling better?

603
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,090
It's you, the lady from the subway.

604
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,240
Yes, thanks to you.

605
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,520
That's a relief.

606
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,840
Eun Oh, do you know her?

607
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,360
- Well-
- I was curious about the designer of this.

608
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,960
It was you.

609
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,130
Well, yes.

610
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:49,220
Could we talk briefly right now?

611
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,030
We happen to be slow right now.

612
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,750
A moment would be okay.

613
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,430
You had company.

614
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,340
We're done talking.

615
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,030
 I accepted it and gave up. 

616
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,930
 I'll try my best. 

617
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,590
 Because we have to go back to the way we were. 

618
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,470
 If you like her so much, 

619
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,540
 why did you let her ask me out and get hurt? 

620
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,590
 Whenever I approached her, 

621
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,180
 you told me to quit. 

622
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,310
 You aren't interested. 

623
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,800
That I'm not qualified.

624
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,070
That I probably...

625
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,530
don't have the right.

626
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,440
You don't have to come in, Ms. Kim.

627
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,200
We don't need tea, either.

628
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,260
This is a surprise inspection.

629
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,040
I heard you often leave for 30 minutes to an hour.

630
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,190
This is inappropriate for you as my boss

631
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,830
and even as my father.

632
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,460
I have both reasons.

633
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,840
"I want to marry someone I meet naturally.

634
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,020
If I do marry."

635
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,800
That was vague.

636
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,960
Make it clear if you intend to marry or not.

637
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,790
Are you relaxed because the sales went up?

638
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,410
Did you put me in this position
without giving me any time?

639
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,830
I told you how I feel about marriage.

640
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,560
I'll give you until the end of the year.

641
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,600
If you can't find someone until then,

642
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,240
that means you lack ability.

643
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,660
Marry the person I set you up with then.

644
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,620
There's a project I'm working on.

645
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,070
I was looking for an interior designer.

646
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:58,650
But I happened to...

647
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,650
Right. What's your name?

648
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,920
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

649
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,510
That's why your company name was Eunoh-ism Design.

650
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,000
Yes.

651
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,140
I'm Ko Seong Hui.

652
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,580
Should I say an art and design space?

653
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,150
I was planning for a space like that.

654
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,610
I just happened to see your portfolio.

655
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,760
It grabbed my attention immediately.

656
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,320
Oh, I see.

657
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,320
I'd like to hire you.

658
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,760
But you don't seem to have a lot of experience.

659
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,270
No. I started interior design a year ago.

660
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,750
Three commercial buildings,
and this cafe. Four projects?

661
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,760
Yes. I designed a few hoobaes' studio apartments,

662
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,260
but those were more for my experience.

663
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,530
I'm not sure how big a space you're planning,

664
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,780
but you should talk to other
experienced designers, too.

665
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,070
If you tell me the aesthetic you want,

666
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,070
I'll do some sketches based on that.

667
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,870
You can see them and decide.

668
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,630
You can get a quote and decide, too.

669
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,460
Why would you say that?

670
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,940
- Pardon?
- It caught my attention. That's enough.

671
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,240
I'd like to hire you.

672
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,490
Me?

673
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,670
I got a good feeling
after looking at your portfolio.

674
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,980
I have an appointment today.

675
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,210
I'd like to discuss details in person.

676
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:33,870
When are you free?

677
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,940
I'm free anytime.

678
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,980
What about the cafe?

679
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,360
I was hired as a manager
with a situation like this in mind.

680
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,090
My school club's sunbae invested in this cafe.

681
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,010
I thought it was a cool place.

682
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,030
It was because it had cool people.

683
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,060
My phone number is on the business card.

684
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,730
Send me your phone number, Eun Oh.

685
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,050
Okay, I will.

686
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,980
See you soon, then.

687
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,550
Okay.

688
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,390
Daebak! Daebak!

689
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,080
It's true that you get blessed if you do good.

690
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,650
I don't know for sure yet.

691
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:19,220
She might've remembered me

692
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,050
helping her and hired me on impulse.

693
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,010
But I hope you hear from her.

694
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:28,320
Me, too. It'd be nice to focus on something.

695
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,000
I didn't hear back from the apartment
that requested a quote, either.

696
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,010
It's an alarm from hell.

697
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,500
 Seongil Textile canceled the job offer to Dad. 

698
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,170
 But without being able to tell us, 

699
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,950
 Dad goes out looking for a job every day. 

700
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,460
Wake up.

701
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,560
I can't do this right now.

702
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,290
They can't find out that I got fired.

703
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,190
I'll catch him as soon as I see him.

704
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,220
Don't worry, and go in.

705
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,070
Okay.

706
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,890
Thank you.

707
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,150
Long time no see, Yeong Ra.

708
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,460
You understand how I feel now, right?

709
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,330
Yeong Ra. Yeong Ra.

710
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,990
Yeong Ra.

711
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,800
What's wrong, Yeong Ra?

712
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,510
I thought I expressed my true feelings enough.

713
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:09,580
I gave you this flower
at your graduation show, too.

714
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,220
Don't you remember?

715
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,900
Mom... Mom... gosh...

716
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,100
- I'm not a scary person.
- Don't hurt me.

717
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,460
- Yeong Ra.
- Don't hurt me.

718
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,700
- Yeong Ra.
- What's wrong?

719
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,330
Who are you?

720
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,140
Ms. Park.

721
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,580
Who was that?

722
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,120
Should I call the police?

723
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,930
 You can't get involved in any rumors. 

724
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,260
No, don't.

725
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,920
I-I think he's a fan.

726
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,340
I got scared because he showed up out of the blue.

727
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,780
Someone who shows up without
notice like that is a stalker.

728
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,330
No, it's not like that.

729
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,780
It's okay, Jeong Hui.

730
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,960
I'm okay.

731
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:27,740
 So, how much longer will you think about it? 

732
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,880
 What do you want? 

733
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,870
 What are you going to do? 

734
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,990
 This is Luce Construction. 

735
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,050
 Your resume has been approved. 

736
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,340
 I'll let you know the interview date next week. 

737
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,890
Good going.

738
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,320
I thought you quit tennis three years ago.

739
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,650
What are you doing here?

740
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:05,790
How did you know I was here?

741
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,140
I tracked your location. Are you happy?

742
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,930
What's with you?

743
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,430
- Eun Oh, you know, Ji Hyeok-
- Hey.

744
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,090
That's a forbidden name.

745
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,580
He doesn't come here

746
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,050
and Seong Jae can't
contact him, either. Isn't that weird?

747
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,960
It's weird. Very weird.

748
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,850
But I need to live, too.

749
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,710
I don't want to think about it.

750
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,510
Okay. Lee Ji Hyeok is a forbidden name.

751
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,520
You ignored my calls and texts.

752
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,090
You even refuse to talk to me in person.

753
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,990
Am I even your friend?

754
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:54,350
I texted you saying I wanted to be alone.

755
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,300
You had to follow me here
instead of leaving me alone?

756
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:02,400
I searched your pool, the Han River path,
and the freediving center,

757
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,890
and I came here just in case.

758
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,690
Why? Is something going on? What is it?

759
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,220
You know nothing ever happens to me.

760
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,540
I looked for you to give you this.

761
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:18,100
What's this?

762
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,800
It's an apartment for our company's guests.

763
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,240
You must've been killing time here
and there, saying you're going to work.

764
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,170
Hang out there.

765
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:37,380
You're being so considerate
when you don't know the situation.

766
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,650
You...

767
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,680
Don't be doing this at a place like this.

768
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,330
It's pathetic.

769
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,080
What's pathetic?

770
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,040
Playing sports is perfect when you need to think.

771
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,280
Look for a job at the apartment tomorrow.

772
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,280
You haven't landed a job yet, right?

773
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,860
Job?

774
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,120
Doesn't your field have positions
for experienced people?

775
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,390
It's not about a job. I'm thinking
about something else.

776
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:08,180
What is it? Is something going on at home?

777
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,350
I was wondering what it'd be like
to marry Jeong Bo Ah.

778
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:16,040
Jeong Bo Ah?

779
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,130
Jeong Bo Ah from Haneul Construction?

780
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,900
Yes.

781
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,870
She proposed to me, so I'm
considering it very seriously.

782
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,660
She wants to marry you?

783
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,240
She suggested that you marry her?

784
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,290
Yes.

785
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,700
Why?

786
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,140
Because she wants to marry me?

787
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,660
She does?

788
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,140
Yes.

789
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:50,070
I don't care if she's crazy or what,

790
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,740
but you don't seem to be joking.

791
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,910
Why should you consider that right now?

792
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,020
Shouldn't I consider it?

793
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,010
You and Jeong Bo Ah have nothing going on.

794
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,100
Why are you so sure? Whether there's
something going on or not.

795
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,620
I know. You don't love her.

796
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,420
She doesn't love you, either. Am I wrong?

797
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:14,170
Oh, love?

798
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,080
No, there's no love.

799
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,660
I know.

800
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,880
What kind of situation is this?

801
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,490
Why would she say something so ridiculous

802
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:27,980
and why would you even consider it?

803
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,600
What is this, a sitcom?

804
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,960
Lee Ji Hyeok, what's wrong with you? Wake up.

805
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,950
Why is love necessary, Seong Jae?

806
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,840
- What?
- Why is love necessary in marriage?

807
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,550
Do you have to marry someone you love?
Marriage isn't the conclusion of love.

808
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,140
What are you talking about?

809
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,980
Why would you want a loveless marriage? What for?

810
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,050
I'm asking why love is necessary in marriage.

811
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,070
Okay.

812
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:59,900
Why do you want to marry someone you don't love?

813
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,300
I don't love her, but I need to get married.

814
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,700
So, why do you want a marriage like that?
Why not just live alone?

815
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,660
Just be alone. I thought you were anti-marriage.

816
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:16,750
- A marriage like that?
- Yes, a marriage like that.

817
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,340
You think I don't know why she wants to marry you

818
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,950
and why you want to marry her?

819
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,900
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

820
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,200
No matter how much you try,
you can't fully understand me. I know that.

821
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,140
But this is funny.

822
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,320
I didn't think you'd oppose it so passionately.

823
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,780
Because I'm your friend.

824
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,730
I'm opposing it because I'm your friend.

825
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,370
Is that so?

826
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:43,940
Ji Hyeok,

827
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,770
this isn't right.

828
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,760
But listening to you,

829
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,050
I think I can do this.

830
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:59,080
Yes. I can do it.

831
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,420
- What?
- This is why I didn't tell you.

832
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,790
This is why I couldn't tell you.

833
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,120
Because it's not something we can discuss.

834
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:10,470
Because you'd never understand it.

835
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,150
Lee Ji Hyeok,

836
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:16,870
is this the extent of our friendship?

837
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,050
There's something you can't talk about.

838
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,600
There was...

839
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,430
between us, too.

840
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,270
What do you mean?

841
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,250
I'm leaving.

842
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,940
You came.

843
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,520
Hey.

844
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,500
Have a seat. You need to sit...

845
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,860
to discuss our marriage.

846
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:26,920
You've decided, Ji Hyeok.

847
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,320
People used to marry three days
after the first blind date.

848
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,710
Thank you.

849
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,560
I feel reassured.

850
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,440
My future won't be so unclear anymore.

851
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,590
I feel the same.

852
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,500
We both get something out of this marriage.

853
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,780
Let's have a win-win relationship.

854
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:58,820
Do you need a contract for a situation like this?

855
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,710
That sounds awful.

856
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:04,480
We're actually getting married.
It's not a contract marriage.

857
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:08,740
You must have some reservations toward me.

858
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:15,000
It sounds like you're the one
with some reservations.

859
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,580
Tell me.

860
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,850
My father and I want you to join our company.

861
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,780
That's the biggest thing.

862
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,020
If so,

863
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,020
I'll tell you my terms.

864
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,990
Are you nervous?

865
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,950
I didn't think I'd meet him immediately like this.

866
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,780
Welcome. CEO Jeong is waiting.

867
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,640
I'm Lee Ji Hyeok.

868
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,590
He's the CEO's chief secretary.

869
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:26,820
Chief Cha Mun Seok and Mr. Kim.

870
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,070
You have a car key in your pocket, right?

871
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:34,950
- Yes.
- Give it to him because it makes noises.

872
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,560
Okay.

873
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,620
Come this way.

874
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,800
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Ji Hyeok.

875
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:47,360
I'm Jeong Ho Yeong.

876
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,250
Bo Ah's father.

877
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,800
Please talk down to me.

878
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,960
We should finish our handshake first.

879
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,850
Have a seat.

880
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:04,260
No need to feel uncomfortable or awkward

881
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,990
right now or going forward.

882
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:10,780
To be honest, we are not dating.

883
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,400
I know.

884
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,870
I know why you're getting married.

885
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,600
But I like you.

886
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,250
You're perfect for Bo Ah right now.

887
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:26,600
I hope you understand what he said.

888
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:31,530
He means everyone knows about me,
and no one on my level wants me.

889
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:33,980
I know that much.

890
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,400
Is love the priority in marriage?

891
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,110
No.

892
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:43,410
I saw my wife three times before the wedding,

893
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:46,590
but we've been doing fine.

894
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,010
Yes.

895
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:55,450
Bo Ah will suggest a few dates
for the wedding later,

896
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:58,090
but I'd like you to hurry.

897
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:01,300
How about in two weeks?

898
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,600
Mr. Kim brought it here.

899
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:28,450
I'll drive with my father.

900
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:29,950
Get in.

901
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,340
Okay.

902
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:44,330
Call me when you get your parents' approval.

903
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:47,810
We'll proceed in the order, then.

904
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:50,440
Okay. I'll be in touch.

905
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,910
 

906
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,710
Text Ji Wan and Su Bin.

907
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,720
Change the next item?

908
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,030
What do you mean?

909
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:21,100
I have an idea.

910
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,420
I'll add a guest.

911
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,240
Guest?

912
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,200
 

913
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,410
 Come home by six. 

914
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,700
 I need to tell you something important. Be there. 

915
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,860
Did I get caught?

916
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,880
Gosh, did I get caught?

917
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,970
Yes.

918
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:49,110
This wasn't working, anyway.

919
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:51,640
I should come clean

920
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,510
and take just one beating.

921
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:57,800
But his punches are too strong.

922
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,680
 Aigoo, what's gotten into you? 

923
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,430
How did you all three come home together?

924
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,520
How long has it been since we ate together?

925
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,960
Hyung told us to come home early.

926
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,700
He called us.

927
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,750
You did, Ji Hyeok? Why?

928
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,950
Is something going on with you?

929
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,870
Finish dinner first.

930
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:33,200
Ji Hyeok, tell us now.

931
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,360
What is it?

932
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:38,340
Why did you call Ji Wan and Su Bin?

933
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,540
Did you guys cause trouble?

934
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:40,640
- No.
- No.

935
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,950
No. I need to tell you something.

936
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:46,820
You're free for lunch this Thursday, right?

937
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,560
Yes.

938
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,240
Mom is probably free.

939
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,970
Ji Wan, Su Bin, cancel plans if you have any.

940
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

941
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:58,890
Ji Hyeok, you need to tell us
what's going on first.

942
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:00,830
I'd like you...

943
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:04,630
to meet the parents of my fiancée.

944
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,130
I'm...

945
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,820
getting married.

946
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:32,870
 ♫ Shining as brightly as the stars ♫ 

947
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:37,400
 ♫ I hope my feelings reach you ♫ 

948
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:46,890
 ♫ I'll take one step at a time
and always wait for you ♫ 

949
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:52,140
 ♫ Under the quiet night sky ♫ 

950
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:56,600
 ♫ Looking at the moon shining brightly ♫ 

951
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:05,680
 ♫ I take a step forward slowly,
hoping to reach you ♫ 

952
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,150
 I'm not asking you to approve this marriage. 

953
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:12,310
 When did you decide to have the wedding? 

954
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:14,690
 You didn't get angry at all. 

955
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,100
 Didn't it hurt your ego? 

956
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,560
 I expect great and refreshing designs. 

957
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,960
 How's 30 million as the design fee? 

958
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,020
 I'm getting married. 

959
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,110
 You sure you won't regret it? 

960
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:25,350
 Ji Hyeok is getting married. 

961
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:28,530
 This was the reason we were incompatible. 

962
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:30,480
 I'm sorting things out for the last time. 

963
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,160
 To send away my unrequited love. 

964
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,870
 Here comes the groom. 

965
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:40,700
 ♫ I'll take one step at a time
and always wait for you ♫
