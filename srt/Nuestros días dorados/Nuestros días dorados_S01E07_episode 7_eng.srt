1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,860
 

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,730
Huh? Director.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,110
Eun Oh...

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,760
How...

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,870
do you feel about me?

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,960
Pardon?

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,420
I asked how you feel about me.

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,510
Why are you suddenly doing this, Director?

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,390
How does that make you feel?

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,090
Was it funny?

11
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,680
Were you surprised?

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,380
Were you scared?

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,020
What's this?

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,110
Why are you suddenly asking a tricky question?

15
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,240
I'll tell you while we eat something together.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,960
You said you didn't have dinner.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,250
Okay.

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,700
I need to work on the partition.

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,600
I was going to eat since I'll sleep here.
What should we eat?

20
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,490
 - What are you doing?
- Get off. 

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,690
 What are you doing? 

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,460
So, is there any progress with the blind dates?

23
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,610
Not yet.

24
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,900
Why is that?

25
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,530
You had more than two since I heard about it.

26
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,510
I have very high standards.

27
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,060
It's not easy.

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,780
After that weird guy messed me up,

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,010
I'm choosing a man very carefully.

30
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,760
You're lying.

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,220
I'm lying?

32
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,960
You can be kind of mean.

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,100
I've been told that I'm too nice,

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,350
but I've never been told that I'm mean.

35
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,640
Though I'm no joke when I get angry.

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,640
What did those men do to deserve this?

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,740
They came out with anticipation

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,170
and someone as great as they hoped for came.

39
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,380
I'm sure most of them asked for a second date.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,300
And I'm sure you rejected most of them.

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,210
I'm not going on blind dates to kill time.

42
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,760
My mom said you need to forget
someone with another person.

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,700
That's what you're trying to do,

44
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,140
but you feel differently on the inside.

45
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,150
Since what Ji Hyeok did had a big impact,

46
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,240
you're trying to distract yourself.

47
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,990
That's a very bad thing.

48
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,900
You're assuming too much.

49
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,030
Su Jeong and I saw the photo
of the man you met recently.

50
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,900
He looks nice, he's tall, and he has a good job.

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,750
Why did you refuse the second date, then?

52
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,470
It's because I wasn't attracted to him.

53
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,380
You'll continue not to be attracted to anyone.

54
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,110
You get asked out, but you reject all of them.

55
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,610
That means you aren't interested in seeing anyone.

56
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,610
How did you know they always
ask for a second date?

57
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,620
I just said that to make you feel good.

58
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,730
What? All of them actually did?

59
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,880
Well, it just happened that way.

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,710
So, stop going on blind dates.

61
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,360
I'll act as your date.

62
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,110
Act as my date?

63
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,410
The three of us should team up
and play the video game.

64
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,420
You said you learned from Su Jeong.

65
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,000
The three of us play the video game?

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,120
You'll forget everything because it's so fun.

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,330
It'll relieve all the stress, too.

68
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,640
You were so funny that day.

69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,880
 Huh? 

70
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,650
 
What?

71
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,630
It's Director Park.

72
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,160
You're right.

73
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,890
- Director!
- Hey.

74
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,980
Don't. He's working. Let's go.

75
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,090
Hey.

76
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,470
Director!

77
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,350
Su Jeong.

78
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,710
Huh? Eun Oh.

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,850
Just one second.

80
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,830
Well...

81
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,590
No...

82
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,580
Do you like this video game, too?

83
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,170
I didn't know you played video games.

84
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,440
Well, I played in school and...

85
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,760
I restarted recently.

86
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,220
Wow, look how disappointed he looks.

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,500
I understand how you feel completely.

88
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,100
Aigoo. You even got up to that mountain top?

89
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,340
Is it really that fun?

90
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,680
I wanted to play briefly
during lunch break, but...

91
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,390
It's 2:30 p.m. now.

92
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,090
Pardon?

93
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,710
Already?

94
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,780
Gosh, you're right.

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,380
I was on my way to meet someone.

96
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,700
You two can make up or cut ties.

97
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,620
I'll go to the stationery store.

98
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,410
I see.

99
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,380
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

100
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,110
You haven't come to the cafe because of me, right?

101
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,150
It's not like I didn't want to. I couldn't.

102
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,670
Are you laughing?

103
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,990
Don't you know how to get angry?

104
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,700
I'm angry because of Lee Ji Hyeok.

105
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,790
You should've said something to me.

106
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,460
And ask me why I'm cutting ties with you, too.

107
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,920
I know. I felt like it was unfair, too.

108
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,500
I didn't know I was just Ji Hyeok's friend.

109
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,540
You and I've known each other
for nine years already.

110
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,250
I thought I was a friend
or at least an honorary sunbae.

111
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,840
We can be friends.

112
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,810
You can be an honorary sunbae, too.

113
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,280
You're an honorary member of Hangyeol Value.

114
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,740
I guess I wasn't myself then.

115
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,530
No, it was my fault.

116
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,900
I sincerely apologize.

117
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,020
Since you're apologizing so formally,

118
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,300
you feel too distant now.

119
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,370
So, have you been going
to a different cafe like this?

120
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,950
How about you?

121
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,290
How have you been?

122
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Don't just dismiss what Seong Jae sunbae says.

123
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,060
Think about it seriously.

124
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,470
Seong Jae sunbae?

125
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,180
You used to call me that before
I started working at the company.

126
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,300
Huh? You're right.

127
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,900
How did I end up calling you Director?

128
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,790
How am I supposed to know that?

129
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,420
You started calling me that
after I gave you my business card.

130
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,380
I see.

131
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,370
I'll let you go now.

132
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,050
You said you need to create
a partition at the cafe.

133
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,270
Okay, Sunbaenim.

134
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,630
Pardon?

135
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,300
It's just for today.

136
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,360
 

137
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,730
You came.

138
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,790
I heard you had a fight yesterday.

139
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,570
But you're back to work.

140
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,060
Well, it's not that-

141
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,560
Mr. Kim asked me where you live
to bring your phone back.

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,810
So, I told him that you'll come to work.

143
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,170
You're the first one to arrive.

144
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,560
No, that's not why I came.

145
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,570
I heard he got angry at you, too.

146
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,430
I'm sorry about that.

147
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,720
Don't mention it.

148
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,340
What should I call you?

149
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,530
Just call me Lee.

150
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,790
Okay, Lee.

151
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,250
Could you remove the stains
on the painted hallway?

152
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,360
Insulation supplies are over there.

153
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,550
But you have to do it alone.

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,420
Okay.

155
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,350
 I'm so tired! 

156
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,130
Hurry. Today's lunch is bibimbap and tonkatsu.

157
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,010
 Okay! Let's go! 

158
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,820
 Yeong Shik loves bibimbap. 

159
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,750
 Me, too! 

160
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,000
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- What?

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,300
Why did the Director come to see you yesterday?
When we were about to close.

162
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,410
I got in trouble.

163
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,910
What?

164
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,010
Is that right?

165
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,000
My friends would've been victimized
if it weren't for the Director.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,640
I thought I'd find someone I like
through blind dates, but...

167
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,850
But?

168
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,630
Thinking about it after listening to the Director,

169
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,260
I knew I was wrong.

170
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,140
It turns out I didn't want to date now.

171
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,470
I thought you were going
to forget him with someone else.

172
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,740
Sorry.

173
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,200
Cancel the rest of the blind dates.

174
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,970
Should we play the video game, then?

175
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,450
Right now?

176
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,240
Hey, we're opening soon.

177
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,260
Just until the first customer comes...

178
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,560
You have to join our team now.

179
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,830
You need to get better since you're the worst one.

180
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,330
- Do a team play?
- Yes.

181
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,800
There are four people.

182
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,930
What if I keep dying and you have to save me?

183
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,320
I'll save you.

184
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,940
That's why you need to practice.

185
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,535
 Lee Ji Hyeok's phone number disappeared. 

186
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,405
 Anyone know if he's alive? 

187
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,950
Ha Jun Sang is seriously so nosy.

188
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,230
 

189
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,870
He changed his phone number, right?

190
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,490
He probably doesn't want to be contacted.

191
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,530
Aren't you worried about him?

192
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,730
No.

193
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,530
How could you not be worried?

194
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,650
It's not that I'm not worried.

195
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,660
I won't worry.

196
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,150
Because I don't want to.

197
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,650
I shouldn't have to worry about him anymore.

198
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,040
Why do you keep probing?

199
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,620
Aren't you a human?

200
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,020
What are you trying to say?

201
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,810
Don't act like you're AI.

202
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,700
Was your pride damaged that much?

203
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,290
Are you so humiliated that you thought

204
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,970
that shallow bastard was a great person?

205
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,990
Yes. I'm dying that I'm wasting time.

206
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,820
I don't want to worry about someone worthless.

207
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,380
I won't worry.

208
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,470
Oppa, I'm sorry
you keep going in late to work because of me.

209
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,380
Mom and Dad are letting me be late.

210
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,810
You don't have to feel bad.

211
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,010
But still. I feel bad and...

212
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,940
I'm so grateful.

213
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,260
Mom keeps interviewing people, but-

214
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,590
It's not easy.

215
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,160
You went through something so serious.

216
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,120
Yeong Ra, don't you worry.

217
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,660
A part-time driver will soon replace me.

218
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,970
A driver slash bodyguard?

219
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,700
You're a pretty good driver.

220
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,560
I heard you took trips
with your girlfriend in Ji Hyeok's car

221
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,160
and got beaten up a few times.

222
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,000
Gosh, Hyung. That was forever ago.

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,670
Only until we hire a new driver.

224
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,950
It'd be two months at most.

225
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,450
Please do me a favor.

226
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,700
- There's really no one we can trust.
- Gosh.

227
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,530
I recently applied for
a really good job, by the way.

228
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,980
- Which company?
- You know Songsong Group, right?

229
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,300
They have a gym for their employees.

230
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,420
How likely is it that you'll get the job?

231
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,680
- About 10%.
- What?

232
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,050
But still. You never know.

233
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,230
When do you hear the result?

234
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,290
Get to work, then.

235
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,270
I'll pick you up later in the evening.

236
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,060
Okay, Oppa.

237
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,670
Hold on.

238
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,300
Today was D-Day, right?

239
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,567
Ji Wan is...

240
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:26,423
 

241
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,170
Hey, Ji Wan. I was just about to call you.

242
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,390
I'll do it. I'll be your sister's bodyguard.

243
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,510
Thank you, Ji Wan.

244
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,380
I'm doing it because I didn't get the job.

245
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,880
But still. You could apply somewhere else,

246
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,480
but you're helping me out.

247
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,430
Oh, yes. That's true.

248
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,500
I'm freeing up two months because you asked.

249
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,840
You're my brother's best friend.

250
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,190
 

251
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,680
Yes, this is Lee Ji Hyeok.

252
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,930
 It's me. 

253
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,930
I don't think we're close enough for you
to say that without telling me who you are.

254
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,270
I heard you disappeared from Seoul.

255
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,510
Are you okay?

256
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,440
Are you asking me that...

257
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,410
expecting to hear the answer?

258
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,990
 I'm sorry, Ji Hyeok. 

259
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,540
Is that why you called?

260
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,990
Get compensated by my father.

261
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,510
 Receive a lot from him. 

262
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,110
 He'll give you a lot. 

263
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,970
Receive money?

264
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,980
 I have nothing to give you. 

265
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,800
 Because you've been greatly wronged, 

266
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
 you deserve it. 

267
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:05,930
Everything you say is true, but it feels funny.

268
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,070
How much should I receive?

269
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,270
How much will your father pay me?

270
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,040
I'm curious how much he thinks I'm worth.

271
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,420
I've been humiliated.

272
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,960
My parents and my family were humiliated.

273
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,900
How much is that worth?

274
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,050
Since I could've had half of Haneul
Construction if I had married you,

275
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,450
can I demand half of the market value?

276
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,630
I'm so sorry.

277
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,170
I apologize.

278
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:46,440
 I had made the decision thinking
I couldn't live without my privilege, 

279
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,360
but I really liked the idea of marrying you.

280
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,970
 Jeong Bo Ah, 

281
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,390
just say sorry and be done with it.

282
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,470
Don't keep talking, trying to console me.

283
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,140
 But... 

284
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,200
I didn't know something.

285
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,120
When I found out where Jae Wuk was,

286
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,580
 I realized I didn't need anything. 

287
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,600
 Jae Wuk will keep doing the welding work, 

288
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,160
 and I'll find whatever I can do. 

289
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,380
So, you want me to get compensated
to match your happiness?

290
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,570
I got it.

291
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,180
Okay.

292
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,850
So, let's end this now.

293
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,050
 Go back. 

294
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,420
Don't be gone for too long.

295
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,500
And...

296
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,630
good luck with your new start.

297
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,310
 

298
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,730
To be honest...

299
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,590
I thought I'd thrive after you died.

300
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,140
Because I was sick of taking care of you.

301
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,690
But...

302
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,380
you let me have purpose

303
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,290
although you were sick, Honey.

304
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,160
When I was washing your soiled diapers
and went to the hospital with you,

305
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,230
I wondered what you'd do without me.

306
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,280
Now that you're gone,

307
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,180
I'm not useful for anything.

308
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,500
Sang Cheol doesn't have a job,

309
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,930
and we don't even know
if our eldest grandson is alive.

310
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,220
Will he answer today?

311
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,450
 

312
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,480
 The number you dialed does not exist. 

313
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,740
 Please check the number and try again. 

314
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,450
 

315
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,940
Mom, can I clear out the storage?

316
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,350
I want to use it as a studio.

317
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,620
- What?
- Can I clear out the storage...

318
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,150
Were you thinking about Ji Hyeok?

319
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,670
Was I?

320
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,050
Mom, you must be very worried.

321
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,990
He changed his number, too.

322
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,000
So many people must've called him
out of curiosity.

323
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,680
I would've changed it, too.

324
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,390
Mom, are you okay?

325
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,530
Ji Hyeok said he'd be back.

326
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,220
Da Jeong, look. Look.

327
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,750
Hyeok... Ji Hyeok doesn't have a phone number.

328
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,190
His phone number is gone.

329
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,700
Grandma, I told you not to call him.
Did you call again?

330
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,800
With so many people calling him,
he probably wanted to avoid them.

331
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,010
Did you guys know?

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,490
Why are you so relaxed if you know?

333
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,870
Aren't you worried at all?

334
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,070
He even got rid of his phone number.

335
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,300
What would you do if he doesn't return?

336
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,910
Mother,

337
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,900
he'll come back if he stops feeling ashamed.

338
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,200
He needs to overcome his shame
to receive calls and respond to texts.

339
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,920
So, let's just wait until he comes back.

340
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,480
When will that be?

341
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,820
When he has strength in his legs.

342
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,120
When he can walk again.

343
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,220
 

344
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,980
 

345
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,520
 

346
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,390
 Getting a job in your field is hard,
but even for the regular office jobs, 

347
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,450
 you won't even get a call for interviews. 

348
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,330
What are you, a prophet?

349
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,870
 

350
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,030
Receive money?

351
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,900
Receive money?

352
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,020
Money...

353
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,290
 Go back. 

354
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,390
 Don't be gone for too long. 

355
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,840
 And good luck with your new start. 

356
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,530
Go back?

357
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,640
Where?

358
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,140
 Because you wanted to pamper your kids, 

359
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,170
 you tried to marry for money and assets? 

360
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,500
 I think you are anti-marriage 

361
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,100
 because you'd lose more than
you gain through a marriage. 

362
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,300
Why are you setting this table?

363
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,760
Did you all have dinner?

364
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,630
Grandma doesn't want to eat.

365
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,430
And I'm going out to meet someone.

366
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,180
Dad doesn't like totbab*.
(Brown seaweed rice)

367
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,420
Mom must've been thinking about Ji Hyeok.

368
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,700
I made it for Dad's health.

369
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,350
I'm leaving.

370
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,390
Does totbab remind you of Ji Hyeok?

371
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,940
What if it does?

372
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,810
Aren't you worried?

373
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,510
I'm not.

374
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,900
What about you? Are you hanging in there?

375
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,720
Ji Hyeok has money to rely on.

376
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,120
So, I'm not too worried.

377
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,780
Money?

378
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,480
That money.

379
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,000
The 80 million you gave him.

380
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,270
You gave him 100 million,
but he returned 20 million for clothes.

381
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:16,610
He's probably taking a trip abroad.

382
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,110
So, I'm not too worried.

383
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,900
 Geez, that punk. 

384
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,300
 
As if he'd never come back,

385
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,620
he really packed up everything.

386
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,480
Yes. I'm sorry, Ji Hyeok.

387
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,270
I'm sorry I stopped you from doing
what you wanted to do.

388
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:47,652
Hey, get married and live a good life.

389
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,762
Enjoy what we couldn't provide-

390
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,720
This bastard... Seriously.

391
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,567
Gosh, there you were.

392
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:17,037
Yes. I was just...

393
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,130
Why are you crying on this happy day?

394
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,510
I know.

395
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,620
I know, but...

396
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,660
I feel so strange.

397
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,470
My heart aches and feels empty.

398
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,810
I feel sad, too.

399
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,000
Why do I only remember what I couldn't do for him?

400
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,200
I cut back on his allowance,
told him not to study abroad,

401
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,620
and the things I ignored even though I knew.

402
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,980
I only remember those things.

403
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,110
He's leaving us now.

404
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,590
I heard that's how everyone feels.

405
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,050
Now that I think about it,

406
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,660
I'm glad you gave him money.

407
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,780
I'm glad you did.

408
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,870
Gosh, what a mean bastard.

409
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,300
 

410
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,460
 I'm home! 

411
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,350
You'll be Seong Jae's sister's bodyguard?

412
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,040
Yes. He was begging me earnestly.

413
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,820
So, I agreed to do it just for two months.

414
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,020
They're looking for a full-time driver,

415
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,040
but the situation is serious
because of the stalker.

416
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,070
So, they're even doing background checks.
Stuff like that.

417
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,690
I guess it's taking a while.

418
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,110
You said you'll be a bodyguard.

419
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,420
But they're hiring a driver?

420
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,930
You need to drive to be a bodyguard, Grandma.

421
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,560
Wow...

422
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,630
How impressive.

423
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,190
I'm Lee Ji Wan.

424
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,770
Yes, Mr. Lee.

425
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,080
You studied Physical Education. How reassuring.

426
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,420
I'll do my best.

427
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,000
We usually interview people first,

428
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,980
but since you're Seong Jae's friend's brother,
we just had you start.

429
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,220
I explained Yeong Ra's situation
and other things to remember.

430
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,420
I see.

431
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,670
I'll keep this brief, then.

432
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:08,790
Air out the car five minutes
before you leave at nine every morning.

433
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,500
Close the windows,
run the air purifier for five minutes,

434
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,670
- and wait in front of the front gate.
- Yes, ma'am.

435
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,160
Escort her inside the studio.

436
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,410
See her closing and locking the door.

437
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:25,510
Yes. Seong Jae told me everything.

438
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,290
Yeong Ra can walk in the front

439
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,730
and you can guard her a step behind.

440
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,180
She's in your care.

441
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,600
Please help us for just a month or two.

442
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,360
Please take good care of our daughter.

443
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,040
Yes, of course.

444
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
 

445
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,270
Air purifier. Okay.

446
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,380
This is my daughter.

447
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,100
Oh, yes.

448
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,070
Open the car door for her.

449
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,930
Pardon?

450
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,320
Oh, yes.

451
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,720
Since the situation has been unstable,

452
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,900
open the door while staying close to her.

453
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,690
No one should be able to approach
her while doing so.

454
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,520
Don't worry.

455
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,790
You got the text about Yeong Ra's schedule, right?

456
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,020
Even when you want to use the restroom,

457
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,340
you can never be away then.

458
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,750
I'm telling you to be ready in advance.

459
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,700
I'll do that.

460
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,850
Hi. I'm Lee Ji Wan.

461
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,780
Okay.

462
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,680
You should tell me your name, too.

463
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,650
Your name.

464
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,410
Name. Your name.

465
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,700
I'm Park Yeong Ra.

466
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,990
How old are you?

467
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,130
- Pardon?
- I asked how old you are.

468
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,880
Do you have difficulty hearing?

469
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,180
No.

470
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,150
It's because you keep talking casually to me.

471
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,790
Of course, I do. Should I use honorifics?

472
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,890
I believe you're younger than me.

473
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,940
I'll ask my mom later and tell you.

474
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Ask what?

475
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,420
You'll ask her about telling me your age?

476
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,650
Why?

477
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,330
Why would you ask her something like that?

478
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,330
You don't have to know.

479
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,110
Please stop talking to me.

480
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,580
What?

481
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,340
This is it, right?

482
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,420
Hey, I was here yesterday to scope out this place.

483
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,870
Okay.

484
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,570
Right. I heard you go home at nine.

485
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,480
You don't need me until then, right?

486
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,870
I was told to wait nearby.

487
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,950
How far does "Nearby" exactly mean?

488
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,740
I'll ask my mom and let you know.

489
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,010
Huh? No, no.

490
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,900
I'll be at a running distance.

491
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,400
So, call me if you need me.

492
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,700
You know my number, right?

493
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,020
My mom gave it to me.

494
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,410
- What's with him?
- What's with her?

495
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,970
If you switch from a single pane
to a double pane window,

496
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,250
you have to add the wall thickness?

497
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,900
How would we know stuff like that?

498
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,320
You didn't calculate that
when you're doing things DIY?

499
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,330
I'm only here to install the sash.

500
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,630
If so,

501
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,120
what do I do with this?

502
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,370
You need to find another company quickly.

503
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,840
I'm leaving. I'm sorry.

504
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,310
Sir, sir!

505
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,300
What do I do?

506
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,840
What do I do?

507
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,280
Excuse me.

508
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,350
Yes?

509
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,790
If you won't expand the veranda,

510
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,890
I can finish it with ALC blocks.

511
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,370
Y-You can?

512
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:25,155
I'm not perfectly skilled
since I'm not an expert, but I've done it before.

513
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,690
Please do that, then.

514
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,940
This is our starter home.

515
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,600
Please do me a favor.

516
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,900
- I'll look up the supplies, then.
- Okay.

517
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,370
Honey.

518
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,010
- Hey.
- He's done. What a relief.

519
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,300
Thank you so much.

520
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,230
You can install the paneling and
apply wallpaper once the blocks have cured.

521
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,820
Apply an elastic coat on the outside.

522
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,350
Well, could you do that, too, then?

523
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,400
I'm not an expert in
interior design or remodeling.

524
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,380
But still. You know a lot more than we do.

525
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,380
We move in two weeks.

526
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,970
We need to finish construction
and move in within two weeks.

527
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,770
But everything is out of order.

528
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,480
I really don't know what to do.

529
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,030
If you don't know anything, why are you doing it

530
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,020
DIY instead of hiring someone?

531
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,140
Because we couldn't afford the turnkey cost.

532
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,350
People on the internet do it themselves, so...

533
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,620
But I can't be your supervisor.

534
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,220
Then, ahjussi,

535
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,820
please come here to work every day. Please?

536
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,320
You could give her advice
while working here. Please?

537
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,470
If that's what you want... Okay, then.

538
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,990
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

539
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,020
That's Lee.

540
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,280
What are you doing over there, Mr. Lee?

541
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,360
What's with him?

542
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,140
Hey, Lee.

543
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,910
He's still so out of it.

544
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,500
I know exactly...

545
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,740
how you feel right now.

546
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,540
I understand everything.

547
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,950
Pardon?

548
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:22,270
I also worked at a company in Seoul
three years ago.

549
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,890
But then, I got laid off.

550
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,940
I tried hard to get back to work,

551
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,780
but things wouldn't go the way I wanted.

552
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,420
You feel awful right now, right?

553
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,420
But everyone ends up adjusting.

554
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,720
You will, too.

555
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,950
What?

556
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,960
Just accept your situation.

557
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,980
More people fail to get back on their feet
than those who do.

558
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,990
So, if you just accept it,

559
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,700
you'll get used to this life, too. You'll be okay.

560
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,930
It'd only make things more difficult for you.

561
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,370
So, don't be so stubborn and just give up. Okay?

562
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,060
I don't want to.

563
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,050
What?

564
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,800
It's not true.

565
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,810
This fellow...

566
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,750
He's still fired up. He still is.

567
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,970
I don't want to live like this.

568
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,250
I don't want to live like this.

569
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,900
No.

570
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,060
No!

571
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,270
 If you get a call from a job you applied to, 

572
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,050
 you'll come back, right? 

573
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,520
 Get compensated by my father. 

574
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,560
 

575
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,590
Oh, hello.

576
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,140
Hand me those.

577
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,010
Gosh, you came early.

578
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,450
You have a design plan, right? Could I have that?

579
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,330
Will you be our supervisor, then?

580
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,430
I'll help you as much as I can.

581
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,720
But don't expect turnkey quality.

582
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,160
Okay, okay. Of course not.

583
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,080
Thank you so much.

584
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,820
Don't mention it.

585
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,570
Relax, Oppa.

586
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,370
There are many festivals in spring and summer.

587
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,770
If you pair a soft sweater with jeans
instead of a T-shirt or a button-down shirt,

588
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,380
you'll look a lot more relaxed and cozy.

589
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,000
Oppa, I told you to smile at me
when I look at you.

590
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,040
Okay.

591
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,050
I didn't know you were looking at me.

592
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,640
- So hot.
- Ha Eun,

593
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,155
can we stop now?

594
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:42,975
We have a lot more to shoot.

595
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,970
Let's just stop now.

596
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,830
It's way too hot. This isn't good.

597
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,260
Oppa, it's a suit this time.

598
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,760
Get changed.

599
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,130
Hurry.

600
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,500
Where would I change, anyway?

601
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,870
Sorry. Sorry.

602
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,190
Geez...

603
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,640
I didn't think Ha Eun would do this.

604
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,140
Hey, Lee Su Bin. What's wrong with you?

605
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,740
What are you doing?

606
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,080
The clothes are in there already.

607
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,460
Get changed in the car.

608
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,740
Hey, people walking by can see everything.

609
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,370
No.

610
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,280
I swear I won't change here.

611
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,540
What am I doing?

612
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,260
Gosh. Isn't this too close?

613
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,480
- Shut the door.
- Okay.

614
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,500
Turn around.

615
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,880
Let's walk over there.

616
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,000
By the way, why aren't you saying anything?

617
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,460
We're shooting our backs now.
I can add it when we edit.

618
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,140
Turn around.

619
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,150
This is a fashionable couple look I recommend

620
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:14,210
when you go to classy exhibitions or concerts.

621
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,400
Hi.

622
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,190
You must be tired. Sit and rest a bit.

623
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,740
Instead of doing this right now...

624
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,810
How about we take a lunch break?

625
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,620
It will arrive soon. I ordered delivery.

626
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,030
What delivery?

627
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,530
We can't eat with all this stuff here.

628
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,130
Over here! Over here!

629
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,400
Over here. Over here.

630
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,970
- Over here.
-Over here!

631
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,410
Here.

632
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,360
You should've ordered sandwiches
if we were eating outside.

633
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,760
Sandwiches aren't filling enough, Oppa.

634
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,750
It's enough for me.

635
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,960
I meant for us, not you.

636
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,400
What?

637
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,320
Carbs. Fat in the tempura.

638
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,350
Protein in the squid. And there are veggies.

639
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,480
It has everything.

640
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,820
You need to consume this many
calories to last until the afternoon.

641
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,930
Gosh.

642
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,250
Let's eat.

643
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,220
Ha Eun, we still have
three more outfits to shoot, right?

644
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,920
Yes. Three.

645
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,720
Gosh.

646
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,740
Can't you use chopsticks?

647
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,610
Did you have to eat with your hand?

648
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,370
What's wrong with that?

649
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,980
Hurry up and eat.

650
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,240
Is it good?

651
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,940
Eat this udon.

652
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,760
Hey.

653
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,140
Sorry for reaching out so suddenly.

654
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,450
 

655
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,690
 

656
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,210
 

657
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,210
 

658
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,920
Hey, are you doing this because I told you

659
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,330
I have a late-night shift today?

660
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,770
I just wanted to see your face.

661
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,690
Come on. You came to see me work.

662
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,330
You said your back is bad. Is it okay?

663
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,460
Pain is a secondary issue.

664
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,460
I don't know when I'll get fired.

665
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,370
That's the sad part.

666
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,240
Working for a taxi company is hard.

667
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,750
Such a small pay and annoying customers.

668
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,890
It's hard to satisfy people.

669
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,200
Don't think about doing this.

670
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,630
I wouldn't do this if I went back in time.

671
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:05,650
You said you liked driving a taxi
because you like to drive.

672
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,260
I did when I first started.

673
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,790
I liked driving and traveling.

674
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:15,000
Back then, I had retired, my cafe failed,

675
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,510
and I had to make ends meet.

676
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,610
Driving a taxi was perfect.

677
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,980
You should find another job now, then.

678
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,500
Try something new at over 60?

679
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,060
Gosh. I don't think I can.

680
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,550
Hey, I have three kids, too.

681
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,630
Aigoo...

682
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,330
I gave up on office jobs.

683
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,110
I applied to over 30 jobs,

684
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,610
but none of them scheduled an interview.

685
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,100
I told you.

686
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,890
So, what will you do?

687
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,790
I've looked into everything.

688
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,780
Technical jobs seem to be the best.

689
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,910
Electricity-related jobs, especially.

690
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,800
I don't think anyone could get a qualification.

691
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,250
Don't you have to study it?

692
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,500
No.

693
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,170
If you get the technician's certificate
and work for three years,

694
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:10,460
you can take
the electrician certificate exam, too.

695
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,040
Lee Sang Cheol, you've decided.

696
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,380
You made up your mind.

697
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:19,100
My priority is having a steady job.

698
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:24,400
One with four major insurances
without a set retirement age.

699
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,390
As long as I can work until my children marry,

700
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,020
I can do anything.

701
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,330
Have you heard from Ji Hyeok?

702
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,200
Why would you bring that up?

703
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,770
Yes, Choi Mu Shik*.
(Means "ignorant")

704
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,670
You ignorant bastard.

705
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,070
Don't ever bring him up again.

706
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,100
Are you still angry?

707
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,580
You don't understand him?

708
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,400
It's not like it's impossible to understand.

709
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,000
The kids these days...

710
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,520
Hey, it's easy to talk about other people's kids.

711
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,370
It's easier to forgive them, too.

712
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:01,250
Seriously.

713
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,820
Drink a glass.

714
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,550
Okay.

715
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,870
 ♫ No matter how much you walk ♫ 

716
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,490
 ♫ It won't end ♫ 

717
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:33,030
 ♫ A wanderer's lonely path ♫ 

718
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,950
 ♫ Foggy... ♫ 

719
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,650
Shit.

720
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:48,760
 ♫ I leave in the foggy morning ♫ 

721
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:55,440
 ♫ The last stop in saying goodbye ♫ 

722
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,430
 

723
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,680
 Around 4 a.m. this morning,
at Yangsu Dam in Ori-si, 

724
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,180
 a body of a man in his early 30s was found. 

725
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,360
 The police started their investigation. 

726
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,240
 They haven't found visible
injuries or evidence of a crime. 

727
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,260
 They found the man's shoes and jacket on the dam. 

728
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,380
 They suspect that he jumped. 

729
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,440
So young.

730
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,380
 

731
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,140
 Today is the day we get together. 

732
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,150
Nice, nice, nice.

733
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,150
Where are you, Director?

734
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,460
I'm in the 9 o'clock direction.

735
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,120
Go, go.

736
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,230
Someone's shooting me.

737
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,240
- Kill, kill.
- Shoot, shoot.

738
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,660
Hold on. Hold on. What do I do?

739
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,040
Kick, kick, kick. In the head. In the head.

740
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,950
- I did it! I killed him!
- Nice!

741
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,710
Nice.

742
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,240
 Cheers. 

743
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,700
Congrats on your first win.

744
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,710
I got so scared about dying
in the red zone earlier.

745
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,040
Eun Oh, when did you get so good?

746
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,720
I'll become a lot better than you soon.

747
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,420
It's kind of strange, though.

748
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,470
The three of us are drinking beer
outside the cafe.

749
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,650
Without Ji Hyeok, even.

750
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,180
I know.

751
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,400
It's our first time doing this without him.

752
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,680
Have you not heard from him yet?

753
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:21,080
That bastard. I wonder what he's up to.

754
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,430
By the way,

755
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,240
hasn't he been gone for too long?

756
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,460
He was removed from KakaoTalk
after he changed his number.

757
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,030
What do you mean by that?

758
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:33,150
In the alumni group chat,

759
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,590
people are saying,
"How could he come back after that?"

760
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,140
It made me wonder if he could come back.

761
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,380
I suddenly had that thought.

762
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,760
And what if he doesn't?

763
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,570
I mean...

764
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:50,000
He's so proud and stubborn.
How could he come back?

765
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,220
Even if he got a job, Seoul is so small.

766
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,030
He'd run into people he knows.

767
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,750
Gosh.

768
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,380
I suddenly have a scary thought.

769
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,670
Gosh, Su Jeong. Don't think that.

770
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,440
He's right.

771
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,700
Why does he have to come to Seoul?

772
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,480
Jeju-do, Busan, or Gwangju.

773
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,730
He could live in any city.

774
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,770
That's true, but...

775
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:20,140
He just disappeared, that's why.

776
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,350
He changed his phone number, too.

777
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,920
 

778
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,500
 

779
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,910
 A body of a man in his early 30s 

780
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,310
 at Yangsu Dam in Ori-si this morning 

781
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,040
 was identified as A,
a faculty member of a university in the area. 

782
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,140
 He was identified after his family
reported to the police 

783
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,450
 after they found the suicide note at home. 

784
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:15,760
Lee Ji Hyeok is so irresponsible.

785
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,260
How could he disappear for over a month?

786
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,960
How pathetic.

787
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,190
Hey, I don't care if you die or not,

788
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,450
but what about your parents?

789
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,860
He's making me worry.

790
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,680
Ji Eun Oh, why are you worried about him?

791
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,570
Yes.

792
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,180
I knew my time would come.

793
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,390
What's Ji Eun Oh doing? So noisy.

794
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,020
Pathetic. So pathetic.

795
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,230
He's seriously pathetic.

796
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:16,870
How could he hide for so long?

797
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:20,140
Is he planning to hide forever?

798
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:24,070
In any case, I was so...

799
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,190
incredibly wrong about him.

800
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,440
You came home late last night.

801
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,350
I think I heard you leaving again.

802
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,520
Yes. I had to take out some trash.

803
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,040
Why did you take it out so late?

804
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,500
Right.

805
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,110
Mom, on your day off,

806
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,850
should we go shopping for your summer clothes?

807
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:30,020
I can spend money
after signing the contract today.

808
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,800
You're talking quietly
so Kang Oh can't hear, right?

809
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,900
Yes.

810
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,460
He freaks out whenever he smells cash.

811
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,180
You can't be too soft on him.

812
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,000
Make sure he doesn't leave the shop.

813
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,720
He couldn't get away with it if Dad were around.

814
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,650
That's why people say
it's hard to raise a son without a dad.

815
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,440
I miss Dad.

816
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,450
You, too, right?

817
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,410
I still always think about him.

818
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,120
Every day.

819
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,090
Do wives love their husbands more?

820
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,980
I miss him whenever I feel upset.

821
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:30,430
Especially when I want to tattletale on someone.

822
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:37,100
I miss Dad so much at times like that.

823
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,530
Gosh, hey. Wake up and eat quickly.

824
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,680
You said you have
an important client meeting today.

825
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,070
Come on and eat.

826
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,000
- Here.
- Okay.

827
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,590
I like the ambience of this gallery.

828
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,890
That's why I suggested meeting here.

829
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,730
Yes. It's a good reference.

830
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,950
I'm sorry I couldn't call sooner.

831
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,160
Something suddenly came up at home.

832
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,300
Did it get resolved okay?

833
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,990
To a certain extent.

834
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,540
Hand me the contract.

835
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,170
Oh, okay.

836
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,200
It's a consulting agreement saying you hired me

837
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,000
and I received the design fee.

838
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,700
I'll give you the detailed agreement
once I get the quote.

839
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,150
Okay.

840
00:57:29,795 --> 00:57:34,540
And I came up with designs using four concepts.

841
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,605
For the first one,

842
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:37,720
I removed the sculpture space
since it takes up too much space.

843
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,800
I included metal smithing, painting,
and stationery design.

844
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,400
- For the second one-
- I'll look at them later.

845
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:49,680
You came up with four concepts already.

846
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,940
You must've worked so hard.

847
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,760
I shouldn't take a glimpse and react lightly now.

848
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,000
I'd like to take my time reviewing them at home.

849
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,280
Okay.

850
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:09,350
Things are still awkward between us, right?

851
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:13,540
Should we take a walk
and check out the stores nearby?

852
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,860
Yes, let's do that.

853
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,150
Let's go.

854
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,590
How nice.

855
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:26,370
It feels lively because
there are so many young people.

856
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,870
Yes.

857
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,460
Gosh.

858
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,100
What's wrong?

859
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,650
Ms. Ji,

860
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:42,050
I have a favor to ask.

861
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:44,160
Yes, ask me.

862
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,970
If I buy that, would you eat it with me?

863
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:52,310
I wanted to try it so much, but I never got to.

864
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:55,050
I couldn't afford it back then.

865
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:01,170
But you're supposed to eat that on the streets.

866
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,840
I know.

867
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,450
If you eat it with me, I wouldn't be embarrassed.

868
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,980
- Here you go.
- Yes. Thank you.

869
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,180
Enjoy.

870
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,490
Here.

871
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,390
Gosh, it's so good.

872
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,660
How could it be so good?

873
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,060
Right. Can you eat stuff like this?

874
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,780
Can you digest it?

875
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,820
Yes. I'm not picky.

876
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,810
I have no dietary restrictions, either.

877
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,610
Really?

878
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:49,720
I wondered if you were weak since you're so thin.

879
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,200
No. I'm totally healthy.

880
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,270
I don't ever get sick.

881
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,170
Really?

882
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,270
I see.

883
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,920
I'm happy that you're healthy.

884
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,600
I thought you might be too fragile

885
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,460
that my project alone
might be too demanding for you.

886
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,900
I was a bit worried.

887
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,790
Don't worry about my health.

888
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:21,520
I can easily pull all-nighters, too.

889
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,510
I care more about the quality
than how quickly it's done.

890
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:30,530
So, take your time working on it

891
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,240
and do other work, too.

892
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,570
You should work a lot at your age.

893
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,090
Okay, I'll do that.

894
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:40,800
Thank you.

895
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,140
Should we walk more?

896
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,530
Yes.

897
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:54,730
 

898
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:56,490
I'm back.

899
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,130
Why are you here so late?

900
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,050
I said I had a client meeting today.

901
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,980
- It took this long?
- Yes.

902
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,480
You had such a long meeting
with an interior design client?

903
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,610
It wasn't exactly a client meeting today.

904
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:09,050
It was more like a date.

905
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,080
- Is it a man?
- No, a woman.

906
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,890
A date with a woman? I'm stumped.

907
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,930
Hold on. Let me check this.

908
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:20,240
 

909
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,930
 I'm contacting you
after seeing your online portfolio. 

910
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,750
 It's about remodeling our new apartment. 

911
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,470
 The construction schedule is tight. 

912
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:29,140
 Can you finish in two weeks? 

913
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,370
I can! I can!

914
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,830
- Eun Oh.
- Hold on. Hold on.

915
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,520
 

916
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,270
Congrats!

917
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:43,180
A 100-pyeong project and an apartment.

918
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,600
You're getting a series of work.

919
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,330
Since I moved on from my past,
a new future came to me.

920
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,930
That must be true.

921
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:51,790
I'm in a good mood.

922
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:54,390
Both of you can go home at eight today.

923
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:55,740
I'll close alone.

924
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,200
- Really?
- Really?

925
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,280
Yes. I can work alone from eight to 10.

926
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,310
Thank you.

927
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:07,000
Thank you. Take care.

928
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,150
Sorry. We're closed.

929
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,170
You still have 10 minutes.

930
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,640
Oh, my gosh!

931
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,970
I'm not a ghost.

932
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,100
It's me.

933
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:44,050
This place hasn't changed.

934
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,950
What...

935
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,910
What are you doing here?

936
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:51,500
Ji Eun Oh...

937
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:57,520
I wanted to tell you something.

938
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:19,590
 ♫ If we meet again, hello, hello, hello ♫ 

939
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:26,880
 ♫ The feeling of longing is
seeping in everywhere ♫ 

940
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:34,200
 ♫ If we meet again, hello, hello, hello ♫ 

941
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:43,520
 ♫ Goodbye to you, whom I've been waiting for ♫ 

942
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,820
 Are you asking why I came or why I'm here? 

943
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,880
 Be clear with your question. 

944
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,750
 What's that? 

945
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:50,770
 I-It's nothing. 

946
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,340
 How could you not tell me, Honey? 

947
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,370
 I had no idea. 

948
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,420
 How dare you act like a madam? 

949
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,930
 If I knew you were so rude, 

950
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,630
 I wouldn't have done this
even if your grandpa asked. 

951
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,110
 You can't earn anything
without sacrifice and hard work. 

952
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:04,650
 You know whose fault this is. 

953
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,560
 I'm here to meet Mr. Lee Ji Hyeok. 

954
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,930
 What did you do with him? 

955
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:10,430
 Does he think he lives here? 

956
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,990
 Where did he go? 

957
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:13,370
 I'll work and sleep here. 

958
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:14,668
 You'll sleep... 

959
01:04:14,668 --> 01:04:16,651
 You'll live here?
