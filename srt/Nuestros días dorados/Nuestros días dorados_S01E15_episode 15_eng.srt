1
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,700
 
But I have conditions. Three of them.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,800
If you accept my conditions

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,300
and get the contract notarized,
we'll work together.

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,640
Notarized?

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,290
One.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,170
The partnership period
will be three months for now.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,590
Two.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,540
If the partnership ends after three months,

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,370
Custom Homes will get an office and move out.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,770
Three.

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,230
Treat each other 100% professionally.

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,430
If you accept these three conditions,

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,050
I'll work with you.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,420
By a 100% professional relationship...

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,470
We will be CEO Lee Ji Hyeok and Manager Ji Eun Oh.

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,600
Do you need time to think about it?

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,830
What would end the partnership?

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Either of us could change our minds anytime.

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,630
That's what you want. Those three conditions.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,840
Yes.

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,610
Do you accept the conditions I proposed?

22
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,710
We'll discuss that again after we get notarized.

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,570
You want to get notarized first.

24
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,710
You can't change your mind
after signing the contract.

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,120
Think about it and-

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,810
I'll create the documents to get notarized now.

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,550
You can go to the job site.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,900
We should also create the first draft
of the contract to save time.

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,990
Yes.

30
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,640
I'll get going, then.

31
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,690
You want to treat me professionally?

32
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,260
Move out if the partnership ends?

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,390
Ji Eun Oh is so cutthroat.

34
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,510
That was good. You did the right thing.

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,010
 

36
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,580
 Did you stay up all night at the cafe? 

37
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,210
 I think I just saw you. 

38
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,110
 Huh? You shouldn't be seeing me at this hour. 

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,920
 You know that I've been working hard
at the office lately. 

40
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,470
 Did you stay up all night? 

41
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,540
 I'll tell you later. 

42
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,920
I don't care if she thinks I'm a snake or a fox.

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,130
I'm Lee Ji Hyeok. I just act like Lee Ji Hyeok.

44
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,750
Ji Eun Oh.

45
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,840
 

46
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,050
Hey, Gyeong Su. It's Ji Hyeok.

47
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,480
I called you too early, didn't I?

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,820
This is my new number.

49
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,500
 What's up? Can't believe you called me. 

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,960
 I heard you started Custom Homes
since you came back. 

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,350
How are you doing lately?

52
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,600
 You must've heard. 

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 I can barely pay rent and make enough
to afford side dishes at home. 

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,450
I can help you feed them pork anytime.

55
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,510
 What do you mean? Are you scouting me? 

56
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,770
Are you interested in working with me?

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,370
We're collecting ideas for the new products.

58
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,190
We'll choose the renewal products by next week.

59
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,470
When you choose the first round of design ideas,

60
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,250
- don't diverge from the brand identity.
- Got it.

61
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,080
I think we need a line for the foreign market.

62
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,330
You want to design specifically
for the foreign market, Director Park?

63
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,340
Yes. Each continent favors different styles.

64
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,650
I want us to keep the functions
but offer different styles.

65
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,490
That goes against our policy
to maintain our identity.

66
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,690
But I don't think we should resist change.

67
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,750
Our group, founded by our predecessors,
has decades of history.

68
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,870
But what we need to focus on now
is Shoejoy's future.

69
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,100
You make a good point.

70
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,500
Director Park, I hope your reasoning is sound.

71
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,260
Of course, sir.

72
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,160
Any other suggestions?

73
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,200
I have a suggestion for the management team.

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,350
I asked for recommendations at several franchises.

75
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,880
They recommended the most popular line.

76
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,960
But I'd like them to ask
what outfits I'll be wearing,

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,610
what colors I usually wear,

78
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,330
if it's for me, if it's for my parents,

79
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,390
or how I normally dress.

80
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,700
If they analyze those factors first
and make a recommendation,

81
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,050
the purchase rate will be much higher.

82
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,490
The manuals for the franchises
are several years old, right?

83
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,970
Well, yes.

84
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,670
Look over the manual, Director Park.

85
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,260
Got it.

86
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,070
What's next?

87
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,050
That's all for today.

88
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,930
Thank you.

89
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,120
They say the destination matters more
than the route.

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,810
Have you finally arrived?

91
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,920
Pardon?

92
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,340
You were pretty useful today.

93
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,060
You're finally acting like my son.

94
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,700
That's my son.

95
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,900
Wasn't this Manager Kang's office?

96
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,080
Oh, she got married.

97
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,180
So, I took over her position.

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,480
But Manager Kang texted me.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,250
It's a work phone. Have a seat.

100
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,460
Is this him?

101
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,990
Gosh. No.

102
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,020
Ms. Lee Su Bin, right?

103
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,650
This is the person we chose for you.

104
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't want him. I want that man just now.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,310
He's so my style.

106
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,230
That's not happening.

107
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,020
He insisted on a woman who has a full-time job.

108
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,250
Full-time job?

109
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,440
He said that proves if someone's diligent.

110
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,110
A proof of one's hard work.

111
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,010
Everyone is trying to become
an influencer these days.

112
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,290
"I'll quit my job and become an influencer."

113
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,430
"Should I quit and become a travel influencer?"

114
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,980
"Should I become an influencer, too?"
Everyone's like that.

115
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,820
I didn't even ask about his qualifications.

116
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,910
I wanted to pursue him because I like his looks.

117
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,020
He might change his mind
once he meets me, don't you think?

118
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,560
He wouldn't have signed up
for a matchmaking service, then.

119
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,770
We provide a matchmaking service.

120
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,430
The more qualified the men are,

121
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,660
they want women to be on the same level.

122
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,540
Everyone feels the same, don't you think?

123
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,850
The text said two men wanted to meet me.

124
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,010
Who's the other one?

125
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,670
He's in his mid-30s.

126
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,160
An owner of a medium-sized business. 178 cm tall.

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,480
Both of his parents are pharmacists.

128
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,500
He looks nice, too. Right?

129
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,850
So?

130
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,980
Pardon?

131
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,510
He's probably not perfect.

132
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,830
He must have a flaw, right?

133
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,970
Yes. That one factor is a bit of a shame.

134
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,380
He's been married before. He has a son.

135
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,620
What did you say?

136
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,550
Hello!

137
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,370
Hello.

138
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,950
What brings you here without notice?

139
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,540
Is something going on?

140
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,800
We decided to become business partners.

141
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,620
Is this the kitchen island you mentioned?

142
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,570
It looks much nicer in person.

143
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,660
Right?

144
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,130
It looks even nicer and more premium at my home.

145
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,770
Manager Ji's color suggestion was so helpful.

146
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,390
She has always had good taste.

147
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,710
It looks so clean without molding.

148
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,600
Here. This is exactly as I requested, too.

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,710
I was told that I could change the layout freely.

150
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,390
Yes, I see.

151
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,390
- Ma'am, please come this way for a second.
- Okay.

152
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,130
Excuse me.

153
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,610
Isn't it strange to barge into my workplace?

154
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,660
I looked around Hyeonmyeong Apartments.
It's the first construction day.

155
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,850
I was on my way back after
doing some other things.

156
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,130
I'm not here to see you. I came for work.

157
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,610
I was curious about
how the kitchen area turned out, too.

158
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,950
I'll get the partnership notarized
before I go back to the office.

159
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,090
Notarized?

160
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,730
I made an appointment
at a notary's office at 4:30.

161
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,210
That's why I stopped by.

162
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,390
I didn't know I was being so rude.

163
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,260
We both agreed to notarize the partnership.

164
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,210
You should've texted me, then.

165
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,710
You think I didn't?

166
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,760
Why would I take such a risk?

167
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,950
 Let's go to the notary's office after work. 

168
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,820
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,070
I didn't hear the ringtone.

170
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,830
No need to apologize.

171
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,310
Han Min's mother, do you mind
if I take a photo of your kitchen?

172
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,230
As I mentioned,
I want to share it on the group chat

173
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,570
for Hyeonmyeong Apartments as a reference.

174
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,260
Gosh. You remembered my son's name.

175
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,290
Of course. You showed me his photo, too.

176
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,560
How could I forget his name?

177
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,280
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Okay. Thank you.

178
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,230
Why are you rushing so much?

179
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,620
I need to get there by 4:45
since the attorney leaves at 5.

180
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,540
It's not that. It didn't have to be today.

181
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,320
I had to do it.

182
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,150
Because I said I'll get notarized.

183
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,280
I suggested it early this morning.

184
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,800
You think I'll change my mind tomorrow?

185
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,220
Gosh. Why would you say that?

186
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,580
You're a woman of your word.

187
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,930
You never go against your own word.
You think I don't know that?

188
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,500
Could you also be responsible
for my safety, then?

189
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,020
I feel very anxious right now.

190
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,650
I'm following the speed limit.

191
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,420
I'm only passing the cars
that are below the speed limit by 20%.

192
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,610
I see. You don't know because you don't drive.

193
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,550
You're talking to me casually now.

194
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,410
We haven't gotten notarized
or signed the contract yet.

195
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,470
Let's get to the notary's office already.

196
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,770
Let's go eat since we finished the notary process.

197
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,220
Since we finished it,

198
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,760
please treat me professionally, CEO Lee.

199
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,020
We haven't signed the contract yet.

200
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,830
You wanted to get notarized
before signing the contract.

201
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,480
You've got to be kidding me.

202
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,760
You said to be professional
as we sign the contract.

203
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,150
That means I can treat you
like a junior until then.

204
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,860
I'm hungry. Let's go get gukbap.

205
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,040
I don't want gukbap. I don't like it.

206
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,930
You don't like gukbap?

207
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,010
We used to eat it all the time.

208
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,720
I've never liked it once.

209
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,600
I like tteokbokki. Let's go to a snack bar.

210
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,370
I did know how to eat it.

211
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,730
You seem to like it.

212
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,530
Ji Eun Oh, don't you feel a bit dissatisfied?

213
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,140
Since I'm doing what you suggest
without resisting?

214
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,490
Not at all. Why would I?

215
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,140
It's so Lee Ji Hyeok.

216
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,590
You put your business forward.

217
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,200
Because I put money forward?

218
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,420
Bingo.

219
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,400
Was it because of your family?

220
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,050
Deciding to become partners, I mean.

221
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,090
Did things get resolved
with your brother, Gang Oh?

222
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,010
I don't want to talk about personal things.

223
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,240
Okay. Let's not.

224
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,500
How come you're walking in together?

225
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Oh, you came.

226
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,740
Something came up.

227
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,200
- Should we take care of it now?
- Yes.

228
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,220
I have no idea what they're doing, either.

229
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,820
Come on in.

230
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,300
Have a seat.

231
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,180
I heard you just hired a web designer.

232
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,070
His desk is already set up.

233
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,010
He'll be managing the website, too.

234
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,460
 

235
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,100
I didn't know how quick you were.

236
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,900
You can only know so much about someone.

237
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
I guess you thought I was slow for some reason.

238
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,590
 

239
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,110
I don't want the conditions
to be too favorable for me.

240
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,540
Let's go with 50-50.

241
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,610
For the first three months of our partnership,

242
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,080
you should be compensated
for not using "Eunoh-ism."

243
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,370
That's why I made that suggestion. Leave that.

244
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,410
Let's revisit whether we'll continue
working together after three months.

245
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,110
That's a special agreement.

246
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,330
I'll add that. Okay?

247
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,130
All right.

248
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm in your care, Manager Ji Eun Oh.

249
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,800
Likewise, CEO Lee Ji Hyeok.

250
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,400
Once I talk to the turnkey clients,
I'll update you on the status.

251
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,860
You're free until then.

252
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,480
Oh, okay.

253
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,980
Well, then.

254
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,840
I guess this is what we've become.

255
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,700
Okay.

256
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,000
We'll keep things the way you want, Ji Eun Oh.

257
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,780
So, you're becoming business partners?

258
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,780
With Ji Hyeok?

259
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,300
I signed the contract just now.

260
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,720
Why?

261
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,620
Why are you working with Ji Hyeok, of all people?

262
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,980
Because I want to make money.

263
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,360
Gang Oh, are you that slow?

264
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,290
I told you to empty the trash.

265
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,230
Why didn't you empty the restroom trash?

266
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,470
Empty the women's room trash, too?

267
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,830
You think you can pick and choose at your level?

268
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,530
Open the bag, add that, and toss it.

269
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
In here?

270
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,840
You can easily fit that in if you compress it.

271
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,290
Are you paying for the trash bags?

272
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,070
Hey, Yang Jin Gu.

273
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,630
Aren't you going too far?

274
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,780
Am I just one of the servers here?

275
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,040
I think you just might become one.

276
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,320
Your mom isn't bringing money.

277
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,110
She'll bring it this week.

278
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,610
Sure.

279
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,580
Wash the trash can and dry it upside down.

280
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,920
Seriously...

281
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,200
Mom, you're home.

282
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,920
I'm so tired.

283
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,480
 When I think about it, 

284
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,030
Gang Oh did have a point.

285
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,060
If they didn't have me,

286
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,980
all the money they spent on me
would've gone to him.

287
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,240
I don't think that's right, Eun Oh.

288
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,640
I agree.

289
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,360
Your parents chose to do that.

290
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,360
I know. But...

291
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,780
Anyway, I want to make money
for Mom and Gang Oh.

292
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,350
That's how it is.

293
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,830
I see.

294
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,660
You're driving me crazy.

295
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,980
What am I supposed to say now?

296
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,730
Nothing.

297
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,440
There are some things you won't know
unless you're in my shoes.

298
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,660
I'll inspect the kitchen since I'm free tonight.

299
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,690
Gosh, I'm so curious.

300
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,480
Why is he there?

301
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,530
Park Seong Jae is close enough to wait for Eun Oh?

302
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,160
Ji Hyeok.

303
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,780
Are you startled that I barged in?

304
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,500
Why did you bother knocking?

305
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,200
I guess I felt impatient because I'm so curious.

306
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,970
About what? My business partnership with Eun Oh?

307
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,950
What are you thinking?

308
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,840
For a win-win business situation.

309
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,590
Is that all?

310
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,650
I answered. Why are you asking again?

311
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,030
Is it just to expand your business?

312
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,050
Yes.

313
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,340
Do I need another reason?

314
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,100
You do. You...

315
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,590
 

316
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,210
Answer it.

317
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,810
No.

318
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,920
Ji Hyeok, you-

319
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,800
Looks like it's urgent. Answer it.
 

320
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,830
Let's talk later.

321
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,680
Talk about what later?

322
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,580
Why would he grill me about this?

323
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,190
Why does he care what I do with Eun Oh?

324
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,460
What are you saying? Be clear.

325
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,290
 I'm no good, they said. I'm no good. 

326
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,280
I'm not qualified, apparently.

327
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,990
I'm not qualified to join the high society, Oppa.

328
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,500
What are you talking about? Help me understand.

329
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,880
They said a nobody influencer like me
has no chance.

330
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,830
 I can't prove my value, apparently. 

331
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,000
 I really enjoy this job. 

332
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,780
I worked hard on the videos,
but I'm not gaining subscribers.

333
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,180
And the subscribers keep asking me about you.

334
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,460
 Ji Hyeok has gone somewhere. 

335
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,910
I can't bring it up with my dad.

336
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,850
I definitely can't tell my mom. Even more so.

337
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,790
That's why I'm telling you...

338
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,960
 You're Ji Hyeok's friend. 

339
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,210
 Why should I call you and say all this? 

340
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,830
- Did you drink a lot?
- I did drink.

341
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,710
But that's not important.

342
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,170
- Did you drink alone?
- That's not important, I said!

343
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,190
It's important to me.

344
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,800
I asked if you drank alone.

345
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,290
 Are you with a friend? 

346
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,610
Ha Eun is inside. I'm in front of the bar.

347
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,700
Okay. Gosh.

348
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,020
- You're good, then.
 - I'm not. 

349
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,300
Not good at all. Not at all!

350
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,460
Did someone say something mean to you?

351
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,960
- Did the matchmaking service say something?
 - Yes. 

352
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,910
I'll get a business card made.

353
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,540
Songsong Electronics' PR Team deputy, Lee Su Bin.

354
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,330
 I'll print that on the business card. 

355
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,700
And I'll meet that man.

356
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,320
I'll make him like me and dump him.

357
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,780
Hey. Songsong Electronics?

358
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,390
- Are you saying you'll make a fake business card?
 - Yes. 

359
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,240
Yes. I will.

360
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,340
Let's see how powerful a business card
and a full-time position are.

361
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,550
I'll test the people who judge me
before meeting me.

362
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,170
I'll see what they do once they fall for me!

363
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,340
 Hey, Lee Su Bin. 

364
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,300
Hey-

365
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,250
Look at her.

366
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,550
 The phone is turned off.
You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

367
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,110
Gosh. Why is she causing trouble now?

368
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,420
You came. Su Jeong,

369
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,270
this is Mr. Cha Cheol Min.
He's the new employee of Custom Homes.

370
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,670
She's my junior and a cafe employee.

371
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:07,050
Hello. I saw you
when you came in for the interview.

372
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,620
Yes.

373
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,800
- Okay.
- I'll leave you to it.

374
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,580
It's humble since it's our first base camp.

375
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,730
It's cozy.

376
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,210
This is your desk.

377
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,140
You need to do something
before the website renewal.

378
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,580
A banner for the turnkey service
and coordinator introduction page. Those two.

379
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,500
I saw the website.

380
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,310
It has way more potential than I thought.

381
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,320
Give me four days. What should I work on first?

382
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,500
You can work that quickly?

383
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,900
The turkey banner first. Make it look like this.

384
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,650
That will take a day and a half.

385
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,330
Four days, including the coordinator menu.
It could go faster.

386
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,120
- This is more than I expected.
- And...

387
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,870
as for the portfolio,
Projects 2, 3, and 4 sound boring.

388
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,970
Project No. 2, the Yeonnam-dong apartment.

389
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,410
Project No. 3, the Bulgwang-dong villa
with a 2-year-old daughter.

390
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,690
You need titles like these.

391
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,160
You'll be working on that from now on.

392
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,330
I know.

393
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,000
Can you manage those things
while working on the renewal?

394
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,270
You need a Q and A page for the renewal.

395
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,950
Can you read my mind?

396
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,160
I'll start working now.

397
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,210
You can't hear the notifications if you wear them.

398
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,980
My eyes are open. I can see them.

399
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,370
Okay.

400
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,510
 Turnkey service is available. 

401
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,100
 Email us the type of home you live in, 

402
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,300
 the size, the construction duration, your budget, 

403
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,160
 and the scope of remodel. We'll get back to you. 

404
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,180
 There's a fee for getting a quote. 

405
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,930
Yes. Uhyeon-dong?

406
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,340
Really? Five units in the same building?

407
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,740
Of course.

408
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,680
We can reduce the demo noise.

409
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,790
You heard about Hyeonmyeong Apartments?

410
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,790
 Please wear black pants and black shoes.
Dress neatly. 

411
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,320
I'm nervous.

412
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,530
Ma'am, these were just fried. They're tasty now.

413
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,630
Please taste them.

414
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,500
Ma'am...

415
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,180
Ma'am, here's a tasty pollack pancake.

416
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,850
Try it.

417
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,660
Would you like one?

418
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,850
Yes. Here.

419
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,850
Thank you. Enjoy.

420
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,920
- Ok Rye, you came in early today.
- Yes.

421
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,070
Gosh. "Ok Rye"?

422
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,220
Are you two dating?

423
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,050
Gosh, no.

424
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,370
We've been friends since we were kids.

425
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,500
Why didn't you acknowledge each other, then?

426
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,080
I didn't recognize her at first.

427
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,720
It's been decades.

428
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,210
Oh, I see.

429
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,180
I asked why you came in so early today.

430
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,800
Gosh. I'm about to reach 1,000. Don't talk to me.

431
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,670
Thank you. Enjoy.

432
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,070
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.

433
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,650
- Da Jeong.
- Hey.

434
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,090
- Your legs must be tired.
- Yes.

435
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,050
But it's not so bad.

436
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,220
Prop your legs up when you sleep tonight.

437
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,560
They might get swollen tomorrow.

438
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,770
I should.

439
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,840
Get ready to go home. You need to go
when the evening shift gets here.

440
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,710
Thank you, Myeong Hui.

441
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,880
I get to work until dinnertime, thanks to you.

442
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,290
It worked out since this is a special sale
for a few days.

443
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:48,410
But it's hard to work without your mother
and Sang Cheol finding out.

444
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,440
Just tell them.

445
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,170
I can't do that.

446
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,840
Sang Cheol won't tolerate it.

447
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,150
Call us if you notice any defects
after you move in.

448
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,040
Okay. You looked through everything so thoroughly.

449
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,040
- I'm sure I won't.
- But still.

450
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,660
Okay, then.

451
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,610
Thanks to you, I learned
when to keep the cost down

452
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,250
and spend when it's needed.

453
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,490
- Thank you.
- I want to thank you, too.

454
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,950
I had fun since we could communicate easily.

455
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,020
Well, this isn't much.

456
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,120
I bought you a hand cream and rice cake.

457
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,890
How did you know I was running low on hand cream?

458
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,270
Thank you. I'll enjoy both.

459
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,350
M-Manager Ji?

460
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,520
Gosh.

461
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,520
When did you come?

462
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,110
I thought you were studying.

463
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,640
I put the payment for the milk there.

464
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,680
And the box next to it is rice cake.

465
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,200
A client gifted it to me
since the project ended today.

466
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,870
I got milk to have it for dinner.

467
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,770
I didn't mean to burden you because of last time.

468
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,930
I'm not giving it to you because of the sandwich.

469
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,290
I got three boxes of that.

470
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,070
If you just leave the rice cake and cash there,

471
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,490
how will I know what I sold?

472
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,480
I was going to text you later.

473
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,350
- Do you have my phone number?
- Yes.

474
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,330
It was in the Mapo project file.

475
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,430
Oh, right...

476
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,260
Anyway, thanks for the rice cake.

477
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,540
Good luck with your test.

478
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,250
How do you know about the test?

479
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,200
I asked you to come back
the next day to my job site,

480
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,140
but you said you had to go to a class.

481
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,300
Oh, yes.

482
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,000
You take a class.

483
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,540
You study direct current machines,

484
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,190
generator-induced voltage, and stuff like that.

485
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,580
It's the electrician certificate exam, right?

486
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,910
Gosh. How did you know that?

487
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,760
Every day, I work with carpenters,

488
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,150
electricians, and equipment engineers.

489
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:39,510
Gosh. I can never trick you.

490
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,780
He wants you in the office as soon as you come in.

491
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,460
Who?

492
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,540
Get going.

493
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,800
Okay.

494
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,770
Say hello.

495
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:14,200
This is Mr. Cha Cheol Min,
who will renew and manage our website.

496
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,650
This is the CEO of Eunoh-ism.

497
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,180
She's our turnkey partner for now.
Call her Manager Ji.

498
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,640
I'm Cha Cheol Min.

499
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,350
You're a full stack developer.

500
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,010
Oh, she studied computer science.

501
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,030
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

502
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,370
- Should we have a meeting outside, then?
- Sure.

503
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,800
I narrowed it down to four turnkey clients.

504
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,420
One sent a plan with their own measurements.

505
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,180
I measured the other two units.

506
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,770
You measured them already?

507
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,910
I'll measure the last one
by the day after tomorrow.

508
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,230
- Hey, by the way-
- CEO.

509
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,770
Pardon?

510
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,100
We're partners. Don't say, "Hey."

511
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,790
Oh, okay.

512
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,250
- CEO Lee.
- Ask your question.

513
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,070
What does this star symbol mean?

514
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,100
They'll likely request a quote.

515
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,060
They didn't mind it
when I mentioned the quotation fee.

516
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,330
You said there will be a quotation fee?

517
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,400
We worked hard to acquire our expertise.

518
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:29,000
Our company won't allow anyone to take it for free
by threatening not to hire us.

519
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,600
These are the designers' portfolios
that Team Leader Jo recommended.

520
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,410
I'll let you decide.

521
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,510
Okay. Got it.

522
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,280
Text me if there are any issues.

523
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,440
We signed the contract yesterday,
but he's made this much progress?

524
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,630
Eun Oh, why does he talk to you formally?

525
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,150
Because we're partners.

526
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,550
We agreed to treat each other like that.

527
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,600
That's one thing,

528
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,910
but he's so... How should I say?

529
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,650
He's so strictly business.

530
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,300
That's what I wanted.

531
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,210
He should because that's what we agreed to do.

532
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,550
- Don't you feel awkward?
- It's a little strange,

533
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,690
but I find it more comfortable.

534
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,960
I don't think that's it.
He was acting like someone else.

535
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,410
He was always driven, you know.

536
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,230
Welcome.

537
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,180
He must be getting a lot of inquiries
about coordinators.

538
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,400
Why is he working on turnkey projects all day?

539
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,350
You go ahead and have dinner.

540
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,050
- I can eat cup ramen, right?
- No.

541
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,680
Pardon?

542
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,960
Well, the thing is...

543
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,790
you can't eat inside the office.
You have to eat outside the cafe.

544
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,300
- Outside the back door.
- Oh, okay.

545
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,850
How about you?

546
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:23,080
I'm not hungry. I don't have time, either.

547
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:28,460
It's your first day, but we're working late
and can't eat together. I'm sorry.

548
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,860
I prefer it this way.

549
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,110
Here you go.

550
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,000
Of all the coordination inquiries we got today,

551
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,570
I made a list of serious inquiries.

552
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,450
Name, phone number, address,

553
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,570
construction duration and scope.
I pulled them together.

554
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:56,150
You created a list and even printed it out?

555
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:00,130
- I'll email it to you if you'd like.
- No, no, no.

556
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,320
You're more attentive and quicker than I thought.

557
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,610
I'm grateful, obviously.

558
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:11,490
The printouts at the bottom are portfolios
and resumes for the coordinator position.

559
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,000
 

560
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,370
He did all sorts of things.

561
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,630
 

562
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,170
What was that noise?

563
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,500
Is she still here?

564
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,950
Is she going to stay here all night?

565
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,970
I can't believe how fearless she is.

566
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,350
If I were her, I wouldn't go outside
after what happened.

567
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,110
What?

568
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,000
She's leaving now?

569
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,820
She should've left sooner.

570
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,380
Did she reserve a taxi?

571
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,930
She didn't reserve a taxi?

572
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,860
Don't just get any taxi. Reserve one!

573
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,750
Wait...

574
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,180
What? She was taking a bus?

575
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,620
Her house is so far away from the bus stop.

576
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,070
Isn't she even scared?

577
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,620
 I still get scared to walk around at night, 

578
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,740
 so I go home before the bus stops running. 

579
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,090
 I wear my dad's jacket and hat, too. 

580
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,870
Geez.

581
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,830
She was like this when she worked for Doogle, too.

582
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,030
I've never seen her taking a taxi.

583
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,190
 You're old enough to know better. 

584
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,490
 Do you still have to take the very last bus? 

585
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,020
 ♫ I'm waiting, say you love me, too ♫ 

586
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:56,560
 ♫ Saying that is enough for me ♫ 

587
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,840
 ♫ Say something if you feel it, too ♫ 

588
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,290
 ♫ I'm waiting, say you love me, too ♫ 

589
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:09,510
 ♫ Don't hesitate and let me know ♫ 

590
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:17,510
 ♫ You act timidly and keep missing your chance ♫ 

591
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:24,060
 ♫ You know, but you pretend
not to and make eye contact ♫ 

592
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:30,920
 ♫ The more I get familiar,
the more curious I become of you ♫ 

593
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,490
 ♫ I hope you become honest now ♫ 

594
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,810
 ♫ Say something if you feel it, too ♫ 

595
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,220
 ♫ I'm waiting, say you love me, too ♫ 

596
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:49,070
 ♫ Saying that is enough for me ♫ 

597
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,970
What are you doing, Lee Ji Hyeok?

598
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,860
She's not even my junior anymore.

599
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,500
Why worry about your partner like this?
Don't you cherish your time?

600
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,860
Don't worry about her starting tomorrow.

601
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,830
No. Why shouldn't I worry? She's my partner.

602
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:07,730
I should give her a clear warning instead.

603
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,940
She has no fear after what happened.

604
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,700
Geez. Gosh.

605
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,350
Gosh.

606
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,080
Hey.

607
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,810
Honey, what's wrong?

608
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,010
It's 2:30. Aren't you going to bed?

609
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,340
You go ahead. I'll finish this first.

610
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,140
When is the test? You've been going to bed
after 3 every night.

611
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm fine. It wasn't scheduled yet.

612
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,230
Doesn't studying in this room
remind you of Ji Hyeok?

613
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,700
You miss him, don't you?

614
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,490
Okay, okay.

615
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,930
Don't stay up past 3.

616
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,490
Get two.

617
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,130
Freeze it immediately.
It will stay the same until Chuseok.

618
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,500
Okay. Thank you.

619
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,640
Enjoy.

620
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,000
It's pollack pancakes.
It's soft and not fishy at all.

621
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,500
- Kids love it, too.
- Try it.

622
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,160
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

623
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,240
- We'll take one.
Thank you.

624
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,130
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

625
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,870
- Da Jeong.
- Hey.

626
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,880
I'm buying eel. Don't you want some?

627
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,950
It will be 40% at closing time today.

628
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,060
- It's high quality and tasty.
- Eel?

629
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,890
Sang Cheol likes eel.

630
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,420
Treat your family since you're getting paid today.

631
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,570
- Should I?
- Yes.

632
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,560
The last one. Two.

633
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,270
Okay. That's it for today.

634
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,800
Make sure to do the finishing stretch.

635
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,290
Okay. Thank you.

636
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,940
Hello.

637
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,400
I see you often. Let's introduce each other.

638
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,990
I don't want it.

639
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,920
It makes me uncomfortable.

640
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,040
How will we introduce each other, then?

641
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,300
Why would we do that?

642
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,000
What family is she from? She's so guarded.

643
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,870
Hold on.

644
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,760
We saw each other many times while working out.

645
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,270
This gym only accepts high society people.

646
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,280
 

647
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,420
Please wait in the car.

648
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,710
- Why?
- Yeong Ra.

649
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,960
That was quick.

650
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,240
Oh, your driver?

651
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,610
Let's go.

652
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,630
What kind of situation is this?

653
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,000
I joined this gym to work out comfortably.

654
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,310
Please tell me what this is for.

655
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,720
I wanted to talk to you, Yeong Ra.

656
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,960
I'm Min Jeong Ho.

657
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,900
I studied in the US and returned to Korea
three months ago.

658
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,980
I'm being trained at Hyeonyu Department Store now.

659
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,870
I don't have a business card.

660
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,450
I'm still finishing my last semester
in grad school.

661
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,200
- It's an art school.
- Art school?

662
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,480
What's your major?

663
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,780
How long do I have to wait?

664
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,740
See you that day, Yeong Ra. I'll be in touch.

665
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,290
What happened?

666
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,590
He goes to the same gym as me.

667
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:41,130
You think I don't know that?

668
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:46,060
Park Yeong Ra, you can't talk
to a random man who talks to you.

669
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,020
What if your mom finds out?

670
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,960
That's what she wants.

671
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,300
What? What?

672
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,780
You don't have to know about it.

673
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,790
Your mom told you to do this?

674
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:01,190
She wants you to go on dates
with random men at the gym?

675
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:05,130
Okay. Let me ask you one thing that
I'm really curious about.

676
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,770
Why do you only do what your mom tells you to do?

677
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,960
Let's talk about the webtoon, for example.

678
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,000
You're such a good webtoon artist.

679
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,310
Why are you pursuing a career in painting,
rather than webtoon?

680
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:18,960
Why should I become a webtoon artist?

681
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,700
Because you're good.

682
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,240
No. I can't comment on your painting
since I've never seen it.

683
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,270
But I think you're a gifted webtoon artist.

684
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,950
I almost finished the file you sent me, too.

685
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,910
Because it's so good.

686
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,220
Really?

687
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,430
How many times did I say? It's good.

688
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:44,230
Have you not found the file that was cut halfway?

689
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,850
Right, Oppa.

690
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,680
I need to call my mom about something.

691
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,140
Ms. Jang won't fall behind schedule.

692
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,790
She'll make sure she has enough pieces.

693
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:58,350
I don't have to worry
if you can vouch for her, Professor Kim.

694
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:02,980
Tell Yeong Ra to learn
the artist's statement, at least.

695
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,350
She needs to answer,
no matter what questions she gets.

696
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,790
Yeong Ra came up with the flower series herself.

697
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:13,070
Yes, I know. Of course.

698
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,190
You're busy. I'll get going now.

699
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,290
Hold on.

700
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,070
It's a nice-smelling perfume.

701
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,550
Thank you.

702
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:47,090
I'll give you a nicer one after the show.

703
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,100
 I had a tea with Min Jeong Ho today. 

704
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,010
Really?

705
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,120
 

706
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,900
You're on the way to the studio, right?

707
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,000
When are you meeting him?

708
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,730
Really? You said no at first, right?

709
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:26,840
Yes. I refused to take his business card.

710
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,280
There's Driver Lee,
and Ms. Jang must be at the studio.

711
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,090
Tell me the details later at home.

712
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,060
What did I hear just now?

713
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,200
But I can guess. You don't have to explain.

714
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,650
I wasn't going to, anyway.

715
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:57,670
So, you're trying
to become a painter for marriage.

716
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,310
You gave up on making a webtoon.

717
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,490
Because that's what your mom told you to do.

718
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,900
Yes.

719
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:09,890
Will "Take My Heart" be your only webtoon, then?

720
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,910
- Probably.
- Hey.

721
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,930
Tell me the rest of the story, then.

722
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:18,270
I mean, you should finish it for your sake.

723
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,300
- Well, Oppa.
- What?

724
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,050
Well...

725
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,820
Do you really think it's good?

726
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,860
What will you do if I think it is?

727
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,230
You won't tell me what happens next.
You're so strange.

728
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,710
I talked about how good it is over and over again.

729
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,230
Why are you asking me again?

730
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,490
It's not that.

731
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,360
You know, So Ri asks Gokgo Chan
to teach her how to fight, right?

732
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,740
I was struggling with the fighting scene,
so I isolated that part.

733
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,470
Teach me how to.

734
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,760
You studied Physical Education.

735
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:05,290
I can't think of good action movements for So Ri.

736
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,210
Is that so?

737
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,810
L-Let me see, then.

738
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,050
Hey, what's this?

739
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,380
You drew her like a man with long hair
fighting a guy with short hair.

740
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,300
I know.

741
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,840
Yeong Ra, she is...

742
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,740
Go So Ri used to do ballet.

743
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:43,290
Shouldn't she move more like a ballerina, then?

744
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,830
- Ballerina?
- Yes. That's right.

745
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,690
Like a ballerina.

746
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,230
She turns elegantly and fights with her feet.

747
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:57,450
Make her do this
with her hair shining in the moonlight.

748
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,450
Dokgo Chan!

749
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,470
You drew it exactly as I said.

750
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,870
She's exactly as I imagined.

751
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:30,480
Park Yeong Ra, you're an amazing artist.

752
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,500
- Really?
- Yes.

753
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,980
Did you really mean it?

754
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,280
Ask me 10 more times. It will be the 100th time.

755
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,900
If you actually make
a Songsong Group's business card,

756
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,840
you'll be guilty of forging a private document.

757
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,590
You said that over 10 times, too.

758
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,080
What will I do with you, Su Bin?

759
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,060
Don't be so stubborn. Don't you see
that it makes no sense?

760
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,860
- I told you not to worry and go.
- You don't want me to worry?

761
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,750
How am I not supposed to?

762
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,420
You're Ji Hyeok's sister
and a daughter to your parents.

763
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,710
You want to forge a document to date a man.

764
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,800
Am I supposed to let you become a criminal?

765
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:25,280
Oppa, I won't become a criminal if you stay quiet.

766
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,550
I'll make him fall for me
before he finds out about the forgery.

767
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,740
I just need a month.

768
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:36,450
Su Bin, you can't force someone to like you.

769
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:40,780
- That's what you think.
- Gosh. I'm going crazy here.

770
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:47,990
But Oppa, I need to do this,
so I don't have regrets.

771
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,920
The moment I saw his photo,
I thought, "He's the one."

772
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,890
I've never felt that way before.

773
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,910
He has everything I want.

774
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,380
I even like his looks.

775
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,850
But because I'm not a full-time employee,

776
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:05,300
I need to give up on him
without meeting him. I hate it.

777
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,870
Lee Su Bin, are you sure
you can make him genuinely fall for you?

778
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,280
Yes. I am.

779
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,380
If he falls for you as you planned,

780
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,830
will you tell him you'll quit your job
and become an influencer?

781
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,290
Yes.

782
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,250
Wait, then.

783
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,870
Hold on.

784
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,880
These are the quotes for the four clients.

785
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,300
Could you approve these first?

786
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,030
All four clients? How quick.

787
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,420
Why are you giving these to me, by the way?

788
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,980
What do you mean by that?

789
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,160
You make the decisions for the turnkey projects.

790
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,240
If you confirm the final plan
and schedule the construction,

791
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,900
we'll hire the contractors
and get paid the set commission.

792
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,820
But these are our first projects.

793
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,900
Shouldn't you check the process?

794
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,260
What's the point of forming a partnership, then?

795
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,360
I'd make more money
if I did turnkey projects myself.

796
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,250
Haven't you seen Custom Home's website?

797
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,410
Projects are flooding in.

798
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,690
Working on those alone will keep me busy enough.

799
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:34,280
That's why I let a trustworthy person
take on the turnkey projects.

800
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:39,060
If so, I can choose the designer I want

801
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,850
and schedule the construction as I want?

802
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,820
You need to send a quote and need
a client who's willing to hire us first.

803
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,490
Of course.

804
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:51,240
You need to choose the designer, too.

805
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,680
I looked through the designer files.

806
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,890
I mentioned Team Leader Jo Gyeong Su before.

807
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,670
He's working from home. I'll send you his number.

808
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:00,540
You can discuss with him.

809
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,810
Okay.

810
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,100
Send the clients the quotes.

811
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:09,320
You don't have to report to me
until the construction is confirmed.

812
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:12,230
Okay.

813
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:14,940
I'll leave you to it, then.

814
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:24,900
He really wants me to do everything myself?

815
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,980
 

816
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,510
Hello.

817
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,380
- Here's a pamphlet.
- Thank you.

818
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:43,740
 

819
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:56,520
Mom, why are you sitting here? Are you okay?

820
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,690
My knees must've aged.

821
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:02,250
Knees? Since when? Do they hurt a lot?

822
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,580
They've been acting up for a while.

823
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,920
Let me help you, ma'am.

824
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,350
Gosh, gosh. I'm okay. Gosh, thank you.

825
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,060
- Gosh.
- Walk slowly.

826
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,580
Oh, yes. Gosh, thank you!

827
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,740
My knees are acting up today.

828
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,630
- Would you be okay?
- I can carry it now.

829
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,060
Thank you.

830
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,310
 

831
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,220
Hey, what's up?

832
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:12,200
I want you to have dinner at home.

833
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,170
I'll make grilled eel, your favorite.

834
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,120
I'll eat later. I can't tonight.

835
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,290
I just can't tonight.

836
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:24,050
I don't feel like eating eel tonight. Bye.

837
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,380
Da Jeong.

838
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:33,390
I'm sad. It was nice to see you the last few days.

839
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,070
Me, too.

840
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,590
Give it to me. It's heavy.

841
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:40,820
It's not heavy.

842
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,140
Are all sons like that?

843
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:53,140
Ji Hyeok carried my stuff since elementary school
to act like a man.

844
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,700
I was jealous of you because of that.

845
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,620
Since I don't have a son.

846
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:01,800
I miss my Ji Hyeok.

847
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:05,890
He's making you suffer so much.

848
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,160
Welcome back.

849
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,030
You have eyes on the back of your head?

850
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,340
I felt the vibration.

851
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,050
I just added the coordinator introduction page.

852
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:24,080
Oh, really?

853
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:29,600
 

854
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:36,470
Yes, Mother.

855
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,740
Ji Hyeok, come by for a meal.

856
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,520
Pardon?

857
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:47,070
I just want to eat with you.

858
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,190
 Can't you? 

859
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,930
I can, of course.

860
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:57,400
- You can?
- When should I come?

861
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,970
Today.

862
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,530
Okay.

863
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,770
Bring laundry if you have any.

864
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:06,470
I'll hang up. See you later.

865
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,070
Okay, Mother.

866
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:20,570
 

867
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,090
 

868
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:35,740
What?

869
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,760
Are you really not coming?

870
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,040
Can't you have dinner at home just tonight?

871
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,080
I said I can't.

872
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,400
I don't understand why you can't.

873
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,890
Why can't you come home just a few hours earlier?

874
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,940
I'm in the study room. I can't talk long.

875
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,060
Hang up.

876
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:59,020
It's not like I could tell him
that Ji Hyeok is coming.

877
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,760
It smells amazing, Da Jeong.

878
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,550
Doesn't it, Mother?

879
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:13,890
Call him, so he eats it while it's hot.

880
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,110
Ask Ji Hyeok where he is.

881
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:18,650
I'm here, Grandma.

882
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,690
Aigoo.

883
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,210
- Ji Hyeok!
- You came.

884
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:29,760
I'm back, Grandmother and Mother.

885
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,580
You're back?

886
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:34,090
I'm back home, Mom.

887
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,940
- You mean, you're done being away?
- Yes.

888
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,640
I'll live here again.

889
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:09,610
 ♫ I open my eyes, feeling butterflies ♫ 

890
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:14,710
 ♫ You're by my side like in a dream ♫ 

891
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:19,830
 ♫ You came to me like a gentle breeze ♫ 

892
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:24,650
 ♫ You and I, our night together ♫ 

893
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:28,340
 ♫ Oh, baby, call me sweetly by my name ♫ 

894
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,770
 How dare you come in here? Who said you can? 

895
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:32,600
 W-What are you doing? 

896
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,240
 I'm in a hurry.
You can't cut in line for the shower. 

897
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,340
 She's making me go all the way there. 

898
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,680
 When was the last time you had a health checkup? 

899
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,360
 Let's go together, Manager Ji. 

900
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,050
 It's an old house. 

901
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,360
 The layout is interesting, too.
I want to work on it. 

902
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,900
 Manager Ji, are you a philanthropist?
Or an artist? 

903
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:51,370
 You think this is a club project?
Don't be so immature. 

904
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:54,610
 Those punks. Did something happen
between you two while I was gone? 

905
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:59,540
 Do you think Eun Oh would want me
to tell you what happened between us?
