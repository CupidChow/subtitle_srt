1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,270
 

2
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,360
 
(Means going up)

3
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,580
Whenever I bike with you,

4
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,340
I always race myself, Ji Hyeok.

5
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,120
It's for the endorphin, you know.

6
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,420
Can't you be in front of me?

7
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,160
It's a flat course starting now. Let's go together.

8
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,630
- This is Lee Ji Hyeok.
 - Deputy Lee, 

9
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,270
 you need to come to the office now. 

10
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,880
 - We're in trouble. 
- What trouble...

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,020
What did Oh Jae Jin do this time?

12
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,900
It'll take an hour and a half. Okay.

13
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,060
An hour and a half?

14
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,000
It takes 30 minutes to drive back
and an hour to the office.

15
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,390
Today is our 300th day together.

16
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,240
300th day?

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,750
I made a reservation at the Ridge Hotel

18
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,100
and the restaurant for one night's stay.

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,230
I wanted to surprise you later.

20
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,710
That's cheating.

21
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,090
We agreed not to celebrate those days.

22
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,740
I did it because I wanted to.

23
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,510
So, tell them you can't go in today.

24
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,100
Tell them you're in Jeju-do now.

25
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,700
They're an important account,
and our team is responsible.

26
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,010
If you leave now, it's over between us.

27
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,930
I can't have dinner with you
even if it weren't for work.

28
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,300
I have plans with my siblings.

29
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,500
Is your plan with your siblings you live with

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,390
more important than our 300th day event?

31
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,630
It's more important.

32
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,480
I planned them first, and we
agreed not to count days.

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,130
Even though I already prepared everything?

34
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,800
You shouldn't have.

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,560
Ji Hyeok,

36
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,860
you still have no interest in marrying me, do you?

37
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,880
I won't with anyone.

38
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,020
I-I'm sorry!

39
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,390
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

40
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,640
Come on. Why?

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,310
What kind of situation is this?

42
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

43
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,540
 

44
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,020
Deputy Lee, what will you do?

45
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,440
A container full of only

46
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,640
1,200 by 600 stone tiles are at the Incheon Port.

47
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,080
Aren't we adding cladding in two days?

48
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,790
Oh Jae Jin, you knew we switched
to tile only for a small area.

49
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,670
When you confirmed the order
with me, you gave me the plan

50
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,260
to switch a third of it to 1,200 by 400
to be cut 200 mm.

51
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,890
As Haneul Construction had a delay,

52
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,400
the exterior material order
got delayed altogether. So...

53
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,680
So, you forgot?

54
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes. Completely.

55
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,830
I told you several times.

56
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,970
You can make mistakes twice,
but repeating three times

57
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,220
means you reached your limit.

58
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,170
Yes, I remember.

59
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,170
How much longer should I tolerate you?

60
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,250
It won't take long.

61
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,050
I'll go look into it.

62
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Why bother going there?

63
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,340
They can't cut them in time
because they're behind schedule.

64
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,640
I already called Changwon Factory 2, too.

65
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,700
You think I didn't do that?

66
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,470
I didn't say I'm going to the stone factory.

67
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,570
Where are you going, then?

68
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,640
I'll tell you later.

69
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,140
Geez. He's so stuck up.

70
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,270
I know.

71
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,310
Stone tiles aren't tofu.

72
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,040
You can't just cut them with a knife. Why is he-

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,340
Yes. I heard you.

74
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,200
- I mean...
- Oh Jae Jin,

75
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,490
give me Haneul Construction's work schedule.

76
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,230
- That's on our team's-
- Not the one on the archive. Give me the file.

77
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,620
A4 paper.

78
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,920
Print it on A4 paper.

79
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,000
You understood this time, right?

80
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,430
I made it clear before we finalized the plan.

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,110
Multiple times.

82
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,120
Exposed ceiling goes well with the retro theme.

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,880
You clearly said you hate it.

84
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,860
Am I denying that?

85
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,260
I changed my mind, Manager Ji.

86
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,540
Push back the opening four to five days, then.

87
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,110
I'll adjust the work schedule later.

88
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,770
You can't do that.

89
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,320
I already mailed the opening invitations

90
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,100
and I posted opening event ads
on social media, too.

91
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,410
I wish you had told me yesterday.

92
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,340
The flooring work is scheduled for Monday.

93
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,870
The rest of the schedule is set, too.

94
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,920
You want me to open a cafe
when I don't like the interior design?

95
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,090
If so...

96
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,400
how about paint that looks like exposed concrete?

97
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,150
- I'll find someone else for that-
- That's not good.

98
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,380
It has to be concrete to look natural.

99
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,460
There's nothing we can do, then.

100
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,080
We just need to stick to the plan.

101
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,390
Gosh.

102
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,480
You give up too easily for someone so young.

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm 30.

104
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,230
And you take construction too lightly.

105
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,680
I hired an inexperienced company.

106
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,410
It sure shows.

107
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,670
Ma'am, please watch what you say.

108
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,200
If you don't fix this,

109
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,600
I can't pay the interim payment.

110
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,600
Is that why you didn't pay it yesterday?

111
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,990
Even though it's four days overdue?

112
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,590
What will you do?

113
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,680
I should stop the construction, too.

114
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,300
- Until you pay the interim payment.
- What?

115
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,900
You'll have to pay an increase
in fees for affecting our schedule

116
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,430
by not making the interim payment.

117
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,950
If you stop now,

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,480
I'll finish with a different company
and sue you for...

119
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,890
not finishing the job, okay?

120
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,690
Go ahead.

121
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,630
I'll post about this on interior design sites, too.

122
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,540
I'll mention the name, Eunoh-ism.

123
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,130
Go ahead.

124
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,370
The meeting progress, plan change, work schedule,

125
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,480
payment schedule, detailed quote,

126
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,060
and a detailed schedule were sent to you, right?

127
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,100
And since we had to work on this cafe,
we had to say no to other projects.

128
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,240
I'll demand compensation for that, too.

129
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,140
Manager Ji!

130
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,450
You can't take what I said literally.

131
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,830
Should I be afraid of your threats, then?

132
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,740
What do you mean, threats?

133
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,140
It's because I have regrets.

134
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,340
Manager Ji...

135
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,790
I mean, if I nagged you, CEO Ji,

136
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,170
I thought you could do something.

137
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,030
Because you work so hard.

138
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,620
Is that so?

139
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,500
I'll give up on the exposed concrete ceiling.

140
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
- And?
- Pardon?

141
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,280
Looks like you have more to say to me.

142
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,350
You mean being rude?

143
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,700
Gosh, I said that in the heat of the moment.

144
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,060
So?

145
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,230
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,740
If so, should we resume on Monday
according to the original schedule?

147
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,080
Yes.

148
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,250
If you pay the late interim payment today,

149
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,700
we'll proceed with the construction.

150
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,920
Geez. I thought she was just sweet and positive.

151
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,750
But she's tenacious.

152
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,900
She had a temper, too.

153
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,130
 
(Hangout)

154
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,040
Hi, Noona.

155
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,370
You came, Seong Ho. Thank you.

156
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,480
Sure.

157
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,680
Did the chat with the client go well?

158
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,320
Yes. She said she'll sue us. So, I told her to.

159
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,240
And she gave up.

160
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,240
People are so strange.

161
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,930
They cross the line if I'm nice to them.

162
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,210
A lot of people are like that.

163
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,540
They're weak with the strong ones
and strong with the weak ones.

164
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,170
Would you like to order?

165
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,290
 

166
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,280
Hey, little brother.

167
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,470
 Aren't you coming? 

168
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,300
It's Saturday today.

169
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,190
You think I'm your Saturday part-timer?

170
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,480
Don't you know I'm in the middle
of a construction job?

171
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,800
You don't do construction on weekends.

172
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,300
It's case by case. I can't come today.

173
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,340
 I have tons to prepare. 

174
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,470
You don't even make money from it. Good job.

175
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,130
Be generous, Kkang Oh.

176
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,830
 My dear brother. 

177
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,470
Forget it, you psycho.

178
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,410
How dare you talk to your sister like that?

179
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,030
It's because I'm exhausted.

180
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,670
Geez.

181
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,490
Welcome. This way.

182
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,960
- Come in.
- Okay.

183
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,200
 

184
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,220
 

185
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,330
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

186
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,190
 You'll be connected to the
voicemail after the beep. 

187
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,490
Chief,

188
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm calling the third time...

189
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,980
not to ask a favor, but to apologize.

190
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,940
Demanding you to work on Sunday...

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,200
It was out of line.

192
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,850
Have a nice day tomorrow.

194
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,770
Gosh, you only have annoying and cheap clients.

195
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,760
When will you have a hanok studio?

196
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,290
Right.

197
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,330
I wonder if Ji Hyeok found a place.

198
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,920
I want to make a map of your brain.

199
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,600
How did the word "hanok" remind you of his house?

200
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,760
He likes hanok, too.

201
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,550
Hey.

202
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,410
How long will you act like a fool?

203
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,570
You tiptoe around him so he doesn't notice, too.

204
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,190
You already know, don't you?

205
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,290
Would I confess my love when he has a girlfriend?

206
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,570
I know. Why do you keep liking that playboy?

207
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,700
Hey.

208
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,600
He's not a playboy.

209
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,930
He's been dating nonstop since he got a job.

210
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,050
How's he not a playboy?

211
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,010
He never cheated.

212
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,800
He's just always in a relationship.

213
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,130
Anyway, he's always dating.

214
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,970
What if he ends up getting married?

215
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,030
He won't.

216
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,570
How do you know?

217
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,770
Because he's anti-marriage?

218
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,680
Even if I told you, you won't understand

219
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,100
or comprehend. So, I won't tell you.

220
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,000
There's something only I know.

221
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,630
You want me to work three nights straight?

222
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,000
If you work three nights, we'll have enough glass.

223
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,670
Geez. He talks so freely

224
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,910
just because he has a mouth.

225
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,650
Should I work with you, too?

226
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,870
I can work without stopping for a minute.

227
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,350
Once the glass is done,

228
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,620
we can change the work order, sir.

229
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,710
When you said you'd wait at the factory,

230
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,310
I should've known better.

231
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,910
I'll do it for only three nights.

232
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,210
I can't convince my employees to work longer.

233
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,070
Under your supervision,

234
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,430
three nights would be plenty.

235
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,080
You know how to flatter people, too.

236
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,630
You know I'm telling the truth.

237
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,880
I really...

238
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,800
appreciate it.

239
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,460
I'm not doing it because you insisted.

240
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,170
You helped me greatly once, but you didn't

241
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,920
demand I return the favor. That's why.

242
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,640
Oh, have I done that?

243
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,600
Geez. Seriously.

244
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,640
I know how proud you are,

245
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,570
but the new employee should take responsibility.

246
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,060
Jae Jin is so clumsy.

247
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,460
If you combine all the mistakes
he's made, he might get fired.

248
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,090
Why should you care?

249
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,340
Why would you step in? It's unlike you.

250
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,090
I know.

251
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,560
Am I more generous because he's so incompetent?

252
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,610
If we keep working on the tiles
while fixing the heat-treated lumber,

253
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,010
we can make it work.

254
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,300
Only if we work three nights straight.

255
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,150
We'll be fine if we proceed like this.

256
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,690
I'm impressed, Deputy Lee.

257
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,810
Thank you.

258
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,120
Thank you.

259
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,180
I appreciate you're letting it go
without complaining, Manager Jeong.

260
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,380
I'll see through the Haneul Construction case.

261
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,250
I won't give it to anyone else.

262
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,900
Buy me a meal.

263
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,790
A drink, too.

264
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,290
Of course.

265
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,830
By the way, looks like you're still struggling.

266
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,670
You keep losing weight. You look tired, too.

267
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,820
It's because I've been fighting my dad a lot.

268
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,260
Fighting? I thought you broke up.

269
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,060
You said he left.

270
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,890
Isn't it over, then?

271
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,380
He's being stubborn.

272
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,180
Being stubborn is my dad's specialty.

273
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,500
He's as stubborn as concrete.

274
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,080
Can't you make it clearer?

275
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,100
You won't know.

276
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,000
This battle will end only if one of us dies.

277
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,440
I don't want to know.

278
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,370
Your face tells me it's complicated.

279
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,110
Do you still feel the same way?

280
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,820
You said you wanted to live simply and alone.

281
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,090
Yes.

282
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,150
Must be nice.

283
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,570
You have things under control.

284
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,510
You're able to not love someone.

285
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:10,090
You're able to not love someone to death.

286
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,590
You're determined to live only for yourself.

287
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,450
I'm jealous that you can be like that.

288
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,300
Because my heart belongs to me,

289
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,140
I should control it.

290
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,530
I'm sure you can do it, too.

291
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Just believe that no feelings
or relationships are permanent.

292
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,670
 Our Ji Hyeok? 

293
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,910
 I guess he doesn't want to marry yet. 

294
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,290
People get married late these days.

295
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,930
When I ask him about it,

296
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,050
he just says, "Okay. Yes. No."

297
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,700
And that's it.

298
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,380
All the kids are like that these days.

299
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,370
Marriage doesn't just concern them.

300
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,070
I'm just hoping he'll get married in a few years.

301
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,870
Wow. You were granted an employment
extension as an advisor.

302
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,060
You sure are different.

303
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,300
- What are you saying?
- He's saying he's jealous.

304
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,200
Everyone wants to marry off their
children while they're still working.

305
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,350
Right.

306
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,880
A wedding is a group effort,
and I've given out a lot, too.

307
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,740
It is a group effort, but...

308
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,550
when Myeong Su's eldest daughter
got married two years ago,

309
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,930
you hired wedding guests.

310
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,320
Why would you bring that up?

311
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,820
Three years after I retired,

312
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,000
I had no one to invite.

313
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,500
Hey, what if I'm unemployed when my kids marry?

314
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,280
That's my biggest fear.

315
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,900
The former director Lee Ji Woon
acquired 15 certificates,

316
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,800
but he can't get a job.

317
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,990
Yes, just drink.

318
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,880
You'd better pace yourself.

319
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,960
Thank you.

320
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,760
By the way, all liberal arts graduates

321
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,200
end up the same way.

322
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,920
That's why I'm trying to do welding.

323
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,750
Once I get a certificate for it,

324
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,400
I could...

325
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,100
get a job anymore.

326
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
We're all worried about our kids.

327
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,890
We worry about raising them,
and even after we retire.

328
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,080
Geez, you bastards.

329
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,910
This was to celebrate my retirement.

330
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,110
Why are you complaining about yourselves?

331
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,770
It's because we're tired.

332
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,000
We're complaining to you
because you have no worries.

333
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,430
- Right?
- Sure.

334
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,350
Yes, let it out with me.

335
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,500
I'll let you since I have no worries.

336
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,080
Yes. You're the luckiest, Sang Cheol.

337
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,310
He didn't just get to work
until the retirement age.

338
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,970
He was hired before he retired.

339
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,200
You can still attend your younger son's
wedding as an executive.

340
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,670
I'm so jealous. Let's drink.

341
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,090
Let's drink.

342
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,420
For Advisor Choi.

343
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,920
 Cheers! 

344
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,730
Not bad. Hyung.

345
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,920
Hey.

346
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,120
Seriously, Ji Hyeok.

347
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,880
I told you. It was an emergency.

348
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,560
Did you guys talk about it?

349
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,110
He wants to pass out rice cakes
to the neighbors to celebrate.

350
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,720
Hey, retirement shouldn't just be celebrated.

351
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,740
Why are we having a party, then?

352
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,640
It's not a party. It's an event.

353
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,570
It's to say, "You worked hard for 33 years, Dad."

354
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,950
How's that not a celebration?

355
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,700
What did you decide on for a gift?

356
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,910
We can't decide on that on our own.

357
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,480
We needed you to decide.

358
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,860
- What are the options?
- We only have clothes or shoes.

359
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,100
I'll be in charge of the ambience.

360
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,400
We need to inflate balloons
and create banners, too.

361
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,260
I'll let you pull money for a gift.

362
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,790
I'm still applying for jobs, you know.

363
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,980
Let's give him a monetary gift, then.

364
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,780
That'd look too inconsiderate.

365
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,220
If you don't give enough,

366
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,680
it'd make you look inconsiderate.

367
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,570
- What?
- Don't laugh.

368
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,780
Why not?

369
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,910
This is what it's like to leave a company.

370
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,780
Ji Wan, send money by the day after tomorrow.

371
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,680
Su Bin, you prepare on the day of.

372
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,800
- Okay.
- Got it.

373
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,660
- What?
- It's Father. It's Father.

374
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,540
Smile, smile.

375
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,800
Dad!

376
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,880
Why would you scare us like that?

377
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,570
You bastards. Something's fishy.

378
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,110
What were you doing without your mom and me?

379
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,270
You're very drunk, Dad.

380
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,170
Hey, you're changing the subject?

381
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,360
It's even fishier.

382
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,530
I ran into Su Bin on the bus.

383
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,980
And we ran into Ji Wan on the way.

384
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,200
It was neat, so we decided to have tea together.

385
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,660
I see.

386
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,070
What a coincidence.

387
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,190
Let's go! Let's go!

388
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,220
- Let's go.
- Let's.

389
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,630
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

390
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,760
Wow. Gosh.

391
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,480
Seeing my tall sons leading the way in front of me

392
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,380
makes me feel so secure.

393
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,680
What about you? Were you at Yeong Bo's shop?

394
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,660
Yes.

395
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,700
They wanted to celebrate my retirement.

396
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,980
So, I had a drink with my college buddies.

397
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,800
I see.

398
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,450
Are all of your friends retiring?

399
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,760
Except for Yeong Bo?

400
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,060
What are you talking about?

401
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,500
I'm the only one who kept a job

402
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,270
until the retirement age.

403
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm also the only one who got

404
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,180
a new job in the same field right before retiring.

405
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,490
Gosh, Father. You're the best.

406
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,410
- The best!
- The best.

407
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,230
Our eldest, Lee Ji Hyeok.

408
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,840
Why won't you say anything?

409
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,620
He really is drunk.

410
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,050
Thank you, Father.

411
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,520
For making us feel secure by getting a new job.

412
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,750
Yeah. So secure, right?

413
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,240
Dad, did you drink a lot?

414
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,210
I drank a bit.

415
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,220
- We're home.
- We're home.

416
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,670
We're home.

417
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,470
How come you came home together?

418
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,510
W-Where's Mother?

419
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,450
She's already in bed, of course.

420
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,750
Honey,

421
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,300
I caught these bastards hanging out

422
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,500
at a cafe without us.

423
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,970
Dad, I told you we ran into each other.

424
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,880
Mom, we went to a cafe because
we thought it was neat.

425
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,980
I see.

426
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,800
Why were you downstairs instead of sleeping?

427
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,210
Well, I need to talk to Ji Hyeok.

428
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,840
He's hard to get hold of.

429
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,860
I'll let you go in first.

430
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,960
Yes, let's go. Let's go.

431
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,910
- Let's go.
- Let's go to sleep.

432
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,960
Let's go to sleep.

433
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,630
What is it, Mom?

434
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,860
- You know, Kyeong Ran-
- Stop.

435
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,160
Hey.

436
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,000
I told you 100 times that I won't
let you arrange a blind date.

437
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,200
She's 29.

438
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,330
She's 165 cm tall. She's a middle school teacher.

439
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,580
Her hobby is playing tennis.

440
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,630
She has an older brother and is non-religious.

441
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,380
She saw your photo. She liked what she saw.

442
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,130
- Anything else to say?
- She's Kyeong Ran's niece-in-law.

443
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,910
She's good-looking, too.

444
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,040
Is that all?

445
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,510
You're no fun.

446
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,100
You seem to date at times.
Why can't you get married?

447
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,260
I'm not because it didn't work out, right?

448
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,410
- When will it happen, then?
- Mother,

449
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,980
getting married is no longer mandatory.

450
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,190
Hasn't any of your friends gotten married?

451
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,430
Seong Jae, Ju Hyeong, Ji Tae,
and Sang Wu. None of them?

452
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,820
Well, not yet.

453
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,100
- I'll go inside. I'm tired.
- Ji Hyeok.

454
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,580
Hey, everything has its season.

455
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,760
Ouch...

456
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,460
Exhausted, right?

457
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,230
Huh? Chief!

458
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,260
What's going on?

459
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,490
Why are you here? How did you know?

460
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,680
You said you won't come.

461
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,700
I knew you'd be doing this alone.

462
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,700
I couldn't bring myself
to swallow food this morning.

463
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,380
The back of my head hurt, too.

464
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,340
Wow. Our telepathy worked.

465
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,710
I'm the one who did that.

466
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,340
I was like, "Don't eat. Have a headache."

467
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,250
When will you stop being so stubborn?

468
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,930
My client gave up,

469
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,080
but I felt bad.

470
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,730
She was so disappointed.

471
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:18,180
She even asked you to paint the ceiling white.

472
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,340
I know.

473
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,880
Isn't she ridiculous?

474
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
You're even more ridiculous.

475
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,750
You can't let her do this to you.

476
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,630
You're an interior designer, not a contractor.

477
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,290
But I've been learning on the job for three years.

478
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,740
Geez. You keep insisting.

479
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,430
Go home.

480
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,970
I don't want you around.

481
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,800
Stop doing this. You're making me cry, Chief.

482
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,880
Go home.

483
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,620
Okay...

484
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,890
Thank you.

485
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,790
He's my first classmate
to send me a wedding invitation.

486
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,980
This is my third time.

487
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,520
Two from work and one from
a doctor friend from high school.

488
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,300
Am I supposed to tell you how many I got, too?

489
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,000
It's so hard to get married, but I am.

490
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,410
- Yes.
- Congrats, Ju Hyeong.

491
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,450
I'm so proud of you.

492
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,500
Didn't you say it'd take two or three years?

493
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,710
I kept fighting Kyeong Hye about it.

494
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,890
So, I asked my father for help.

495
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,660
We managed to get a full-term lease
using our savings and a loan.

496
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,330
We're being unfilial, spending
the parents' retirement fund.

497
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,020
Unfilial? I wish I could say that.

498
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,090
Your parents must've wanted to help.

499
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,140
Don't feel so guilty.

500
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,680
Park Seong Jae.

501
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,900
The third-generation chaebol
should show minimal reaction.

502
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,150
Just nod.

503
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,950
I'm not even jealous of you
since you're a different breed.

504
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,310
But I'm most jealous of Ji Hyeok.

505
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,640
He could get married, but he chooses not to.

506
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,500
It's cool because he's young now,
but what about when he's old?

507
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,920
Will you still surf when you're over 60?

508
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,240
Still ride the mountain bike?

509
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,290
You think women would still line up then?

510
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,720
Come on.

511
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,660
You think you're a winner
since you're getting married?

512
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,100
How dare you drag me down?

513
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,810
You can do a lot when you're old.

514
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,210
Ride a normal bike, swim, trek,

515
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,460
camp, and you can travel.

516
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,380
When I get the retirement fund,
I'll go on a cruise, too.

517
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,580
This bastard is too proud.

518
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,270
By the way, Ji Tae, you're the only child.

519
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,730
Will you take care of your parents in the future?

520
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,550
That won't be right.

521
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,580
Parents and children
live separate lives these days.

522
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,200
When my dad gave me 100 million,

523
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,520
he said not to expect another penny

524
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,000
since he'll take out a reverse mortgage.

525
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,200
To die alone or together?

526
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,900
You'd be asking that if your family
of origin faced issues.

527
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,700
 Ju Hyeong is the first one to marry. 

528
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,150
 It was as expected. 

529
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,890
How could he date the same person for five years?

530
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,230
Because he loves her.

531
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,800
For five years?

532
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,500
He just grew attached.

533
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,700
He should've broken up before
he got attached, like you. Right?

534
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,800
Isn't it funny?

535
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,840
You always make it clear before you start dating

536
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,480
that you're anti-marriage.

537
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,240
But why did your ex-girlfriends

538
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,490
want to own you legally over time?

539
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,540
It's probably a desire to possess.

540
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,430
You have no woman waiting yet, right?

541
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,270
Wait a bit this time.

542
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,010
Why?

543
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,850
You don't have to know yet.

544
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,950
Don't be silly.

545
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,340
Doesn't your family want you to marry?

546
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,700
Your parents must need you to get married.

547
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,570
Right.

548
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,130
They'd want me to have at least two children, too.

549
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,740
Why do they expect you to marry

550
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,700
and have children once you're married?

551
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,620
When will you tell your parents, by the way?

552
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,960
I should find a place first.

553
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,290
 

554
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,910
 

555
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,920
 

556
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,470
S-Su Jeong.

557
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,900
Su Jeong!

558
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,270
I just got a text about the heater.
They'll bring it now.

559
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,400
It's basically new. Used it three times.

560
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,260
And you believe that?

561
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,160
But still. I'm sure they didn't use it a lot.

562
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,880
I'll be right back.

563
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,060
Hello.

564
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,990
Are you Kideuk-kideuk?

565
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,470
It's Eun Oh.

566
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,020
She's buying used stuff again.

567
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,370
30,000 won, please.

568
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,390
Here.

569
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,760
Thank you.

570
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,460
E-Excuse me!

571
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,760
Shit.

572
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,880
Hey!

573
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,200
Hold on...

574
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,750
Hey, Ji Hyeok.

575
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,230
Shit!

576
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,450
Hey!

577
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,010
Stop! You bastard!

578
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,120
Give me my 30,000 won!

579
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,670
Stop right there...

580
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,690
Shit.

581
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,540
Hey, hey.

582
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,540
- I caught you.
- Move!

583
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,130
You can never. No!

584
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,670
Shit!

585
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,600
Ji Hyeok, what are you doing here?

586
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,020
How much was it?

587
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,810
30,000 won.

588
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,050
30,000 won?

589
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,040
Geez.

590
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

591
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,470
Geez.

592
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,450
What should we do with this bastard?

593
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,600
What should we do?

594
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,860
Take him to the police or make him pay you?

595
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,700
I'm sorry. It was a prank.

596
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,900
Give me my money!

597
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,150
Ouch...

598
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,340
I'll give you this and get you a new heater...

599
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,040
I'll buy you the newest model.

600
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,100
He says a newest model heater.

601
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,090
You'll give me 30,000 won and
get me a new heater, too?

602
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,180
What do you say?

603
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,790
- Now we're talking.
- Right?

604
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,550
 

605
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,350
Seriously.

606
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,270
How dare he?

607
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,470
Okay.

608
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,100
You're in a good mood, right?

609
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,430
Of course. They say he's done this before.

610
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,520
What a bastard.

611
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,900
This isn't your first time, either.

612
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,260
Me?

613
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,860
Trusting people easily and getting fooled.

614
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,040
Right.

615
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,580
I've been guilty of that.

616
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,420
What's wrong with the world?

617
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,640
It's so hard to trust people.

618
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,860
- Right?
- Don't even.

619
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,930
You dare chase after him into a secluded area?

620
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,680
You must've worried about me.

621
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,280
You'd be bawling out of frustration
after getting hit by that big guy.

622
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,090
Anyway, I didn't get hit, and I caught him.

623
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,710
And someone is also worried about me.

624
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,990
What a nice day.

625
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,660
She's happy after risking her life
for over 30,000 won.

626
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,830
Would you like a coupon?

627
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,120
That's what happened.

628
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,260
 I see. 

629
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,210
It turned out to be a scam again.

630
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,100
What a relief.

631
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,710
So, did she send him to the police?

632
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,510
Yes, but...

633
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,610
Ji Hyeok definitely ran to the back.

634
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,350
But I have no idea how they caught him together.

635
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,020
Here they come.

636
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,040
- You came.
- I'm glad you came.

637
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,440
Ji Hyeok, how did you know to follow her?

638
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,210
She was acting stupid at the intersection.

639
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,300
I could see it coming. Geez.

640
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,690
She was probably falling for it.

641
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,960
Why were you looking for a heater in this weather?

642
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,640
What heater?

643
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,390
Oh, you came.

644
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,930
- Salute.
- Salute.

645
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,610
- At ease.
- Yes, ma'am.

646
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,600
She checked the conditions
at the house to be repaired.

647
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,540
Apparently, it was very poorly insulated.

648
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,890
Gosh, Ji Eun Oh.

649
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,970
You're so unexpectedly thoughtful.

650
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,690
By the way, are you joining the meeting, too?

651
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,950
I think I'm no longer required.

652
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,680
Are you here as the building owner?

653
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,820
To check on the cafe sales?

654
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,790
Hey, man. I sponsor this cafe. It's not for profit.

655
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,200
I'm busy counting the money I made
from the architecture projects.

656
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,860
Here are some cookies.

657
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,820
Snacks for the meeting.

658
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:51,170
 Jo Hyeon Su! Jo Hyeon Su! 

659
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,990
- At ease.
- At ease, at ease.

660
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,230
Gosh, the honorary member.

661
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,270
Thank you for the donation.

662
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,090
Don't mention it. Let me know if you need more.

663
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,170
He's a great young man.

664
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,340
Carry on. I'll go upstairs.

665
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,200
- Take care!
- Take care!

666
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,040
The honorary member will leave now.

667
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,870
Fighting, everyone.

668
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,670
- See you.
- Bye.

669
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,220
Let's prepare for the briefing.

670
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,210
Okay.

671
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,950
Jun Yeong, come.

672
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,620
In this house, a grandfather in his 70s,

673
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,270
Hye Yeong, who's in 8th grade,

674
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,600
and Dong Su, who's in 6th grade,

675
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,100
and a 45-year-old uncle were living in one room.

676
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,920
But thankfully, there's more space here.

677
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,320
We'll make a room for Hye Yeong.

678
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,690
For the rest, we'll redo the bathroom
tiles, paint the windows,

679
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,470
refinish the cupboard, and change the flooring.

680
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,440
I think that should be enough.

681
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,670
That's a ton of work.

682
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,240
This is why Eun Oh insisted that we come.

683
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,020
She's a pro.

684
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,700
We rewired the electrical lines
while dividing rooms.

685
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,360
- Hae Gwang, the wiring expert, should be aware.
- Okay.

686
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,220
Okay.

687
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,280
And this is the most important part.

688
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,250
I think we need to get used doors for the interior.

689
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,170
I'll get that since I've been gone for a year.

690
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,060
Wow, Ji Hun.

691
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,760
Thank you, Ji Hun.

692
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,890
Sure.

693
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,490
Check your roles in the file one more time, please.

694
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,030
 Okay. 

695
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Does the tie look okay?

696
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,700
You must feel sad.

697
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,480
I just feel a little strange.
But I'm not sad at all.

698
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,790
I'm not leaving forever.

699
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,170
I'll be working at Mr. Choi's office.

700
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,060
I know you want to blame the tie right now.

701
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,800
"I can't leave because of you.

702
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,690
I'm not done with you, tie."

703
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,090
Gosh, I've lived with you for too long, Da Jeong.

704
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,510
I'm leaving.

705
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,920
- Here.
- Yes, bring it out.

706
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,080
Dad.

707
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,680
What? Gosh.

708
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,010
Wow.

709
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,190
It was my idea.

710
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,980
We're seeing you off for the last time.

711
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,400
Wow, this is such a treat.

712
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,690
Start.

713
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,800
 Have a good day at work. 

714
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,180
Yes, thank you.

715
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,320
I feel so supported.

716
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,700
Me, too.

717
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,410
Have a good day at work, Honey.

718
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,810
Me, too.

719
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,400
Son,

720
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,510
have a good day.

721
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,170
Yes, Mother. I'll be right back.

722
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,970
See you, Honey.

723
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,220
Two sons and one daughter, see you.

724
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,260
Fighting, Dad!

725
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,210
Fighting, Father!

726
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,930
- See you, Father.
- See you.

727
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,680
Bye, Dad.

728
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,390
- Bye!
- Fighting.

729
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,080
What are we buying today, Da Jeong?

730
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,060
Galbi, japchae,

731
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,800
a few kinds of jeon, and mussel miyeokguk.

732
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,380
He likes mussels.

733
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,160
Let's make salted fish soup.

734
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,210
Let's make a clamshell dish

735
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,410
and make udon in black sauce, too.

736
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,160
Rockfish kimchi, too.

737
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,440
Pardon?

738
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,220
I can pay for them.

739
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,400
Let me pay for everything today. Here.

740
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,170
Well, where did you-

741
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,520
It's the pocket money you gave me.

742
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,100
It's not exactly my money.

743
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,580
No, Mother. It's not that.

744
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,490
I didn't give you that much, but you saved a lot.

745
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,600
While my son worked for 33 years,

746
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,620
he's been feeding me for over 20 years.

747
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,260
It would've been so nice if I had a lot of money.

748
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,820
To congratulate your retiring son,

749
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,250
you want to treat everyone, don't you?

750
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,720
That's right.

751
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,020
Let's do that.

752
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,580
Yes, Mother. Instead...

753
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,120
I want you to pay yourself.

754
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,370
Yes, let's go. Let's go.

755
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,660
- Watch for the balance there.
- Yes.

756
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,930
Be cautious.

757
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,700
 

758
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,900
He acts the same on his last day, too.

759
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,260
He's not impacted much by the retirement.

760
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,300
Why?

761
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,800
Didn't you hear? He'll be
an advisor for Seongil Textile.

762
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,200
- Really?
- Yes.

763
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,660
 For 33 years, 

764
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,730
I've been a piece of a mosaic at work

765
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,450
and a supporting act.

766
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:53,480
But I believed I played a crucial role,

767
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,310
but on my last day at work,

768
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:01,130
I get to make a speech as the leading act.

769
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,020
No one forced me to, but I've been putting

770
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,300
the company first for the past 33 years.

771
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,190
 For that reason, 

772
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,000
 it's been rewarding and satisfying, 

773
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,200
 but I feel empty. 

774
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,440
 But this is how life is. 

775
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,990
 I knew this day would come. 

776
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,730
 But it feels like I'm a flame that's been 

777
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,610
 burning as if'd never die, 

778
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,740
 but turned into ash instantly. 

779
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,360
 My juniors, 
 

780
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,330
 I'm sorry I couldn't treat you better. 

781
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,060
 And my few remaining seniors, 

782
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,840
 thank you. 

783
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,110
 Since my expiration date has come, 

784
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,180
 I'll leave Gyeongseong T and C. 

785
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,030
Thank you.

786
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:57,170
 Thank you for letting me work
until I hit retirement. 

787
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,950
 Take care. 

788
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,290
 

789
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,920
What a graceful landing.

790
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,890
Dad!

791
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,900
Congratulations on retiring!

792
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,550
Congratulations on retiring, Dad.

793
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,220
Yes, thank you.

794
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,210
Father, you've worked so hard.

795
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,560
Applause!

796
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,540
Congrats.

797
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,840
Father, congratulations.

798
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,600
- You came.
- You worked so hard.

799
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,310
Seong Jae.

800
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,250
You'll have an extra tasty home-cooked meal today.

801
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,190
Have you been well, Grandmother?

802
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,770
Yes.

803
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,500
- Hello, Mother.
- Hi.

804
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,090
Has Grandfather gone somewhere?

805
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,500
My father went to his hometown
for his eldest brother's 90th birthday.

806
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,180
Oh, really?

807
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,960
Let's go.

808
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,070
- Give it to me.
- Let's go inside.

809
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,860
Let's go.

810
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,450
Mom, Grandma, what did you make?

811
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,990
We made a lot.

812
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,240
Gosh, thank you for waiting.

813
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,210
Gosh, what's all this?

814
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,860
They just proved what
a full spread looks like, Dad.

815
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,500
Clamshell dish and salted fish soup, too.

816
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,960
Sit down, Sang Cheol.

817
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,730
The noodles are bloating.

818
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,970
Yes, Mother.

819
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,590
Wow, look at this.

820
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,770
Mother made all the hometown dishes you love.

821
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,320
Here's your udon in black sauce.

822
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,530
Yes, udon in black sauce. Nice.

823
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,530
Aigoo, let me try.

824
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,330
It tastes the same, Mother.

825
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,690
Thank you, Mother.

826
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,960
Come on and eat. Let's eat.

827
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,400
- Let's eat.
- Thank you.

828
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,140
Father, you need to give a speech.

829
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,810
Speech, my foot.

830
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,060
I'm getting back to work in two months.

831
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,450
But still. You reached the retirement year.

832
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,390
You should give a speech.

833
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,310
Is that so?

834
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,100
Okay. Sorry about everything.

835
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,170
Thank you, and I'm in your care now. The end.

836
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,350
You, too. Mother.

837
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,880
Okay.

838
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,390
Seriously.

839
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,390
That was too short.

840
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,240
And why are you in our care?

841
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,860
Well, since I've been busy
with work and this and that,

842
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,480
I haven't been the best dad. I'm sorry.

843
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,290
But thank you for turning out so well.

844
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,760
From now on, I just need to care
for Grandma and Mom.

845
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,560
I hope you live your lives well.

846
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,250
That's what I'm saying.

847
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,230
And Ji Wan,

848
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,370
I hope you work at one place
patiently in the future.

849
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:55,370
And Su Bin, you said you want
to be a content creator.

850
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,560
I heard it's very competitive, too.

851
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,840
I hope you work as hard as you can.

852
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,350
And Ji Hyeok,

853
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,670
you should invest less in your hobbies

854
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,130
and save up for marriage.

855
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:08,990
Got it?

856
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:11,030
 - Yes. 
- Okay.

857
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,770
- Father.
- Yes?

858
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,350
What about me?

859
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,560
Hey, why should I worry about you?

860
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,330
You're successful and have a supportive family.

861
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,770
I have something to say.

862
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,650
You need to lower your standards and date.

863
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,000
Hey, why won't you date?

864
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,110
Gosh, I know.

865
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,330
Thinking now,

866
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:35,400
Ji Hyeok and Seong Jae, you're already 33.

867
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,930
You should prepare to settle down.

868
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,000
Su Bin is still young.

869
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,120
When Ji Hyeok and Ji Wan get married,

870
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,850
I can give you about 70 to 80 million.

871
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,440
Keep that in mind.

872
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,720
You have money to give us, Dad?

873
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,720
I heard you advanced your retirement
when you bought this house.

874
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,670
Don't you need to pay off the mortgage
with the rest of the pay?

875
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,080
Right. You need to save up
for retirement, Mom and Dad.

876
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,400
But don't worry about me.

877
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,070
I'll meet a rich man.

878
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,590
You're 24, but you sound so immature.

879
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,370
Hey, don't worry about us.

880
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,870
I'm Seongil Textile's advisor.

881
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,590
If I get paid for another 10 years,

882
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,070
that'd be our retirement pay.
We get state pensions, too.

883
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,700
Right.

884
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,390
We no longer need to spend on Grandpa.

885
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,340
I swear I'll never get sick.

886
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,680
Grandma, you don't get to control that.

887
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,690
Births and deaths are the
only things we can't control.

888
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,690
Grandpa didn't get sick because he wanted to.

889
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,370
Geez. You got dumb over the past year.

890
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,450
You need to watch what you say.

891
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,990
Ji Wan and Su Bin are right.

892
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:49,210
We'll take care of ourselves from now on.

893
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,490
You should finally relax now.

894
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,370
You, too, Grandma.

895
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:57,150
It's not because we don't trust you.

896
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,460
We want to help as parents.

897
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,070
You'll probably get married in a few years.

898
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,550
Oh, right.

899
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:09,010
I forgot my gift.

900
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,180
- Father.
- Huh?

901
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,630
This is a travel pass for a trip to Europe.

902
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,090
You get to visit three countries in a month.

903
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,360
You can call the person once you decide.

904
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,790
Hey. A-A trip to Europe? For a month?

905
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,660
Oh, my, Seong Jae...

906
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,360
Are you trying to impress everyone right now?

907
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,240
Seong Jae, you can't do this.

908
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,950
You can't give a bigger gift than us.

909
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,130
It's okay.

910
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:34,120
Think about how much of our food
he's eaten since middle school.

911
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,670
He owes several times more than that.

912
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,830
I got it cheap through our company connection.

913
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,230
We...

914
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,880
prepared a monetary gift.

915
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,450
Spend it where you need it.

916
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,190
Well, we could've just had a meal together. Why...

917
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,590
I know you guys need it more.

918
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,250
This is for Grandmother.

919
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,540
This is for Mother.

920
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,520
Seriously.

921
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,530
You both worked hard until his retirement.

922
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,690
Hey, Ji Hyeok.

923
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,350
Aigoo, Hyeok...

924
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,610
Keep this for when you get married.

925
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,120
I have no need for money.

926
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,060
Gosh, Grandmother. Everyone needs money.

927
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,770
This is why you have to be rich.

928
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,280
It's hard to look cool without it.

929
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,590
Yes. You're cheating, too, Hyung.

930
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,040
You prepared money for them behind our backs?

931
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,570
This is why he's the eldest son of the family.

932
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,440
The eldest sons are different for a reason.

933
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,130
Once I meet my great-grandchild,

934
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,420
I won't mind dying right there and then.

935
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,900
- Okay?
- Grandmother.

936
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,300
- Let's all eat.
- Let's eat.

937
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,720
Turn the alarm off or don't sit up like that.

938
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,820
You don't go to work starting today.

939
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,470
I know.

940
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,440
You're right.

941
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,600
Gosh.

942
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,430
Aigoo.

943
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,960
I don't have to worry
about running into Father anymore.

944
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,480
My heart.

945
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,610
Let's see.

946
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,350
 

947
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,280
 - Yes. 
- Hey.

948
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,410
This is Lee Ji Wan's morning call.

949
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,000
Did you sleep well, my baby?

950
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,090
 - Yes, Oppa. Thank you. 
- Later-

951
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:57,380
Father's marriage support fund.

952
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,940
 Last one. 

953
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,790
Nice. Good work.

954
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:06,940
Mr. Lee.

955
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,310
Mr. Lee, just one second.

956
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,820
Excuse me.

957
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:13,020
You're...

958
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,280
free in the morning from Monday to Friday, right?

959
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,490
- Yes.
- You'll have a new personal training client.

960
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,040
Okay.

961
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,220
An ahjumma.

962
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,310
Geez. I told you not to get me a female client.

963
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,450
I can't do women.

964
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:29,060
She asked specifically for you.
What am I supposed to do?

965
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,870
If you keep doing this, I'll get...

966
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,290
- yelled at by the owner.
- Me?

967
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,700
She chose me?

968
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,950
Mr. Lee Ji Wan!

969
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:50,100
Gosh, Mr. Lee, I didn't know you
switched the fitness center.

970
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,570
You know me, right?

971
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,410
I was your student at Honghong Swimming Center.

972
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:57,100
I'm Ha Yeong Hee.

973
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,540
Honghong.

974
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,060
Honghong?

975
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,030
This is crazy...

976
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,740
 

977
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,750
Time goes by so slowly.

978
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,970
 

979
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,450
 

980
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,230
The family owns the house, but the mortgage-

981
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,390
Oh, too bad...

982
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,180
So, it looks like...

983
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,330
you have no savings or a job.

984
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,020
Of course, I have a job.

985
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,280
I said I'm a YouTuber.

986
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,230
You have 13,000 subscribers.

987
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,200
It means you basically have no income.

988
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,540
Men know about that stuff these days.

989
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,030
But you definitely...

990
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,940
You definitely have a strength.

991
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,800
You're young, pretty, and have a nice body.

992
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,960
Right?

993
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,910
I'm not lacking in anything in particular...

994
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,380
My YouTube channel will grow quickly.

995
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,860
Okay.

996
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,870
Do your parents know you're here?

997
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:54,470
Gosh, no.

998
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:56,790
They're a bit conservative.

999
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:00,410
And I'm choosing my own date.

1000
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,710
Date...

1001
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,230
You aren't looking to marry?

1002
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,250
I'll date and then get married.

1003
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:09,700
I'm not just trying to meet a rich man.

1004
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:16,700
Okay. Could you tell me what kind of man you want?

1005
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,200
A bachelor's degree from a school in Seoul.
A professional or a businessman.

1006
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,270
Which means he has to be competent.

1007
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:24,860
His parents need to be completely independent.

1008
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,650
And I want to buy a house when I get married.

1009
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:31,590
He has to be at least 177 cm tall.

1010
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,390
He can be up to 12 years older.

1011
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,780
But no big belly. He needs to take care of himself.

1012
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,070
And he needs to have a likable face.

1013
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,160
Are you done?

1014
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,280
So, someone educated, has a good job,

1015
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,700
rich, from a good family,

1016
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,400
and he needs to be tall, handsome,
and well-built, too. Wow.

1017
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:02,090
You're looking for someone perfect.

1018
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:06,240
Five-star clients who are VVVIPs.

1019
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,920
- Do I?
- Yes.

1020
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,610
Well, Su Bin...

1021
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:18,300
will a perfect man like that want to date you?

1022
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,420
You're young and pretty,

1023
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,520
but you come from an ordinary background

1024
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,980
and you're basically jobless.

1025
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,520
Geez.

1026
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,930
 

1027
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,140
Wow. What perfect timing.

1028
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,390
I was just returning from the gym.

1029
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,230
You happen to come out now.

1030
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,780
Today is Sunday.

1031
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,000
Why did you come to the office?

1032
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,870
I left some paperwork at the office.

1033
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,790
You're giving me pressure
if you keep doing this, Director.

1034
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,180
You don't have to say that, Eun Oh.

1035
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,310
You know I'm always bored.

1036
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,010
He has everything, but he's always bored.

1037
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:17,100
I don't understand him.

1038
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,440
Is everyone sleeping in because it's Sunday?

1039
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,510
You should've slept in, too.

1040
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,010
All three of them have already left.

1041
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:28,610
Ji Wan has a date, and Su Bin has a shoot.

1042
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,980
Ji Hyeok said it's volunteer day
for the architecture club.

1043
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,100
He graduated from college so long ago.
And he still does that?

1044
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,590
Does he like it?

1045
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,760
He says it's fun.

1046
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,380
He must do it because it's fun.

1047
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,280
Does he still have lingering feelings?

1048
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,140
He doesn't.

1049
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:51,250
I told you, they don't design buildings.

1050
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,730
Back in college, they redid wallpaper
and flooring for people in need.

1051
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,670
They worked together during vacations.

1052
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:00,540
And now, they volunteer to fix houses
that need a lot of work.

1053
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,260
I-I know. I know that.

1054
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,320
He feels good doing volunteer work
and releases his stress.

1055
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,550
Were you still bothered by that?

1056
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,170
No, no.

1057
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,470
He's still doing such a difficult job.

1058
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,920
I just find it interesting.

1059
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,960
- I'll go wash my hands.
- Okay.

1060
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,780
It's Ji Hyeok.

1061
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,700
You're right. It's Ji Hyeok.

1062
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,090
Seong Jae.

1063
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,040
Hey.

1064
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,920
Park Seong Jae... Park Seong Jae!

1065
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,100
W-What's wrong, Director?

1066
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,880
It's funny.

1067
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,910
Hey!

1068
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,030
Hey, hey!

1069
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,280
He's fast.

1070
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,000
Hey, wait!

1071
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:08,100
Hey!

1072
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,300
Are you having fun?

1073
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,320
Gosh, I'm beat.

1074
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,250
Hey, where's your car?

1075
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,820
I parked in the parking lot
because I couldn't find a spot.

1076
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,090
By the way, why are you with Eun Oh?

1077
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,860
He went to the gym in the morning,

1078
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,170
stopped by the office to pick up some paperwork-

1079
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,530
I saw her leaving, carrying a lot of stuff.

1080
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,880
We have no team dinner tonight. We'll be off late.

1081
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,350
- I know that much.
- Leave!

1082
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:29,560
Let's go.

1083
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,840
Geez.

1084
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,820
Thank you, Director. See you.

1085
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,680
Let me.

1086
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,240
Why did you come so early?

1087
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,390
Me? I walk fast.

1088
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,300
It's a steep hill, isn't it?

1089
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,400
Are you tired?

1090
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,580
She likes him that much?

1091
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:56,030
Wow. The mold issue is serious.

1092
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,770
Bleach won't fix this.

1093
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,350
We need to remove all the wallpaper.

1094
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,550
It's too moldy.

1095
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:05,570
You should've made all the students come.

1096
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,010
Make Eun Oh do it.

1097
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,610
Eun Oh, you said you loved ripping wallpaper

1098
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:12,460
when you worked to make money in college.

1099
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,050
That's why you got into interior design.

1100
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,320
That can't be.

1101
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,410
Ripping wallpaper is the most annoying part.

1102
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,200
When the dirty wallpaper comes off

1103
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,960
and the white wall gets revealed, it's thrilling.

1104
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,630
Wow. You're so different.

1105
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,600
Let's douse everything with mold
remover and redo the wallpaper.

1106
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:32,590
But we need to remove it here.

1107
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,370
This will be Hye Yeong's room.

1108
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,470
Mold is worse here.

1109
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:37,750
I'll rip it out.

1110
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,140
Here comes the scariest sentence.

1111
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,400
"I'll rip it off."

1112
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,780
Hey.

1113
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,500
You need to explain the joke to the seniors.

1114
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,220
She always-

1115
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,260
No one can stop her when she says that.

1116
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,590
Well...

1117
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,990
There's no time. Let's treat the mold first.

1118
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,500
And Ji Hyeok's team, start by creating
a door for Hye Yeong's room.

1119
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,780
- Okay.
- Okay.

1120
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,180
- Let's start!
- Fighting, fighting!

1121
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,310
Lift me. Higher.

1122
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,320
 - Where's Seong Jae?
- He left at five in the morning. 

1123
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,370
What?

1124
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,100
Mi Yeon saw him when she just woke up.

1125
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,860
Where did he go so early on Sunday?

1126
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,590
He left without telling us?

1127
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:30,130
He left in a training suit.

1128
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:32,410
He probably left to exercise.

1129
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,870
Have a seat.

1130
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:37,870
Don't try to call him for no reason.

1131
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,440
Okay?

1132
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,720
Did you sleep well, Dad?

1133
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:47,210
Your mom knows me inside out.

1134
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:49,100
Let's eat.

1135
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,930
Let's see.

1136
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:55,700
Has it been a week since I ate with Yeong Ra?

1137
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,250
Aren't you working too much?

1138
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,860
Not at all.

1139
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:05,230
Yeong Ra, do you want to go out
for lunch with me today?

1140
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,590
I need to go to the studio today.

1141
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,220
But it's Sunday.

1142
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,480
Tell her to rest today.

1143
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,820
Gosh. You know I want to, too.

1144
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,620
Artists can't work leisurely ahead
of their private show.

1145
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,040
They have to focus.

1146
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,020
Gosh. You came, Seong Jae.

1147
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:26,940
Sorry, I'm late.

1148
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,660
I woke up early, so I went out for a drive.

1149
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,120
I see.

1150
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,380
You must be hungry since you woke up early.

1151
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,540
Have a seat.

1152
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,330
I'll serve his soup.

1153
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:37,650
I'll do it since he doesn't like clams.

1154
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,110
Thank you.

1155
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,400
You woke up early without sleeping well.

1156
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,440
Were you worried about the proposal?

1157
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,920
It's not that.

1158
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,850
Yeong Ra, is the private show prep going well?

1159
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,690
You must be tired.

1160
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:55,170
I just need to paint according to the instructions.

1161
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,610
Mom is more tired preparing for it.

1162
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:01,020
Gosh. I'm so nervous, Seong Jae.

1163
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,760
Father is already used to it,

1164
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,740
but I get nervous about helping
with a private show.

1165
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,620
So, how do you handle
the tough successor training?

1166
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,320
Thank you for the meal.

1167
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,810
Sure.

1168
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,740
 I'm always watching you. 

1169
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,240
What?

1170
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,150
Right here. Yes.

1171
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,490
A little more.

1172
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,350
So heavy! Move!

1173
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,350
What?

1174
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,200
Guys, you're done with the plumbing
in the kitchen, right?

1175
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,880
Jun Sang probably did.

1176
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,380
Jun Sang?

1177
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,320
You did it, right?

1178
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,910
We have to hurry.

1179
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,570
Would this work?

1180
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,510
That's it.

1181
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,380
Yes.

1182
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,200
I'm checking to see if it's level.

1183
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,890
Manager Ji,

1184
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:27,040
we're following the plan to a tee.

1185
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,570
Here.

1186
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:30,120
- Perfect, right?
- Totally.

1187
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,390
 

1188
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:33,120
Good work!

1189
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,000
So pretty.

1190
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,940
So pretty...

1191
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,290
- Is there a hardware store nearby?
- Why?

1192
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:47,870
Hye Na, look up a hardware store.

1193
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,230
Why?

1194
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,600
It's a teenage girl's room, but there's no lock.

1195
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,220
How do you know all this?

1196
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,620
I have a younger sister.

1197
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,700
They usually keep their doors locked.

1198
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,800
They freak out if you don't knock.

1199
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,690
Hardware stores are probably closed now. Give up.

1200
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,460
- Yes.
- Let's do it next time.

1201
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,900
Okay. I'll fix it on the weekend.

1202
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,990
I know Eun Oh is like a peddler,

1203
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:12,260
but she can't have a doorknob.

1204
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,710
They call me a peddler for a reason.

1205
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:15,980
- You have one?
- No way.

1206
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:18,130
You've got to be kidding.

1207
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,650
Wow, she's scary.

1208
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,020
She has it!

1209
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:28,010
Here you go.

1210
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:32,500
I had an extra while switching
doorknobs at the cafe restroom.

1211
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,730
Daebak.

1212
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:35,210
Hand me that bag.

1213
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:38,120
She had a doorknob?

1214
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:42,230
I'm impressed, Manager Ji.

1215
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,400
 

1216
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,750
 

1217
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,500
I love it.

1218
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,900
It might feel stuffy since there's no window.

1219
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,620
I still like it.

1220
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,840
And...

1221
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:24,950
Here. It's a key to the room.

1222
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:27,180
You're a lady now. Keep the door locked.

1223
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,330
You can't just let anyone in.

1224
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:32,820
This is too moving. Seriously.

1225
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,450
Should we applaud?

1226
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:36,250
Good luck, Hye Yeong.

1227
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,610
Live well!

1228
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,660
Please be happy.

1229
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,170
Be happy, Hye Yeong.

1230
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:44,650
- Congratulations.
- Let us know if you need anything.

1231
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,630
Be in touch.

1232
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,680
Get some sleep.

1233
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,470
But no snoring.

1234
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,980
I'm okay.

1235
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,500
Your eyes are red.

1236
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:05,980
You nap often. Why are you staying awake?

1237
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,300
You can't fall asleep.

1238
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,400
I need to watch you.

1239
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,200
Have you seen me falling asleep while driving?

1240
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:20,100
The new unni is lasting long.

1241
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,470
Why did you call her unni?

1242
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:27,100
She might be younger than you.

1243
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,400
What do you call your senior's girlfriend?

1244
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,100
Ms. Girlfriend?

1245
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,170
Just call her a girlfriend.

1246
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:37,040
Why is it lasting so long?

1247
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,740
I think it's been almost a year.

1248
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,420
Will you celebrate our anniversary?

1249
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,900
You can't have long relationships
when you're anti-marriage.

1250
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,040
None of your business.

1251
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,800
Just go to sleep.

1252
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:57,950
But it does concern me.

1253
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,040
 Team Leader. 

1254
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,980
What would you like to eat?

1255
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,450
 

1256
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,940
Yes. This is Lee Ji Hyeok.

1257
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,990
Is there a new listing?

1258
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:26,210
Their contract hasn't expired yet.

1259
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,040
But the renter's mother got sick.

1260
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,850
He moved his stuff first to move in with her.

1261
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,590
This is the best one I've seen.

1262
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,280
I'll sign the contract.

1263
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,920
Excellent choice.

1264
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,120
I'll contact the owner and schedule the signing.

1265
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,300
Okay.

1266
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,620
I want to visit all the spots in "Roman Holiday."

1267
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:52,020
I want to see Sagrada Família in Barcelona.

1268
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,800
And for Paris...

1269
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,250
Do you remember that movie?

1270
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,400
The bridge from "The Lovers on the Bridge."

1271
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,340
Ethan Hawke was so handsome
in "Before Sunrise," too.

1272
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,870
I've wanted to visit Vienna, too.

1273
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:09,230
Yes. Back in our day, we imagined cities abroad 
watching movies. Yes.

1274
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,340
Pick just one place you want to visit.

1275
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,760
I'll choose two.

1276
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,010
No. You make all the decisions this time.

1277
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,190
Do whatever you want to do.

1278
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,640
 I'm home. 

1279
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,000
Gosh.

1280
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,100
Our eldest son came home early for once.

1281
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,740
Yes.

1282
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,040
- I'm home.
- Hey.

1283
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:31,350
How fascinating.

1284
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:34,350
Ji Wan and Su Bin just came home, too.

1285
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,580
Grandma eats and goes to bed early these days.

1286
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,980
It's still early in the evening.

1287
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,800
It happens when you're old.

1288
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,160
She's 88 years old.

1289
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,940
There's something I need to tell you.

1290
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,560
I want to be independent now.

1291
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,050
What, independent?

1292
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:08,670
I'll be moving out and living on my own now.

1293
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:10,340
Ji Hyeok.

1294
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:14,840
What's he saying out of the blue?

1295
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,620
You'll get married soon. Why move out?

1296
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,030
I have no interest in getting married.

1297
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:22,710
You have no interest in marriage?

1298
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:25,250
What do you mean, Ji Hyeok?

1299
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,710
 It's exactly as I said. 

1300
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:44,090
 I have no interest in marrying anyone. 

1301
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:48,340
You don't want to get married?

1302
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,880
Don't you have a woman you like?

1303
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,780
No, I don't.

1304
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,140
 

1305
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,360
I'm not planning to find a woman, either.

1306
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,570
 I found her. 

1307
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,230
You found her?

1308
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:45,580
That's why I'm telling you that I'm moving out.

1309
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:35,190
 

1310
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:38,860
 You won't be saving money the moment you move out. 

1311
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:41,790
 You don't mind me marrying first, then, right? 

1312
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:45,200
 L-Late stage pancreatic cancer? 

1313
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,850
 Oppa, Oppa, did you hear? 

1314
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,310
 What would happen to Dad? 

1315
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:51,810
 You want me to date an old man
who's 17 years older? 

1316
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:55,910
 Ji Eun Oh has liked Lee Ji Hyeok for a long time. 

1317
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,990
 How could that benefit me at all? 

1318
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:02,200
 Gosh, what are you doing here? 

1319
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,240
 You told me to come. 

1320
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,270
 I like you, Sunbae.
