1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,290
It... It says "adopted" at the bottom.
What's that?

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,100
 

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,720
What does it mean?

4
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,460
How pathetic.

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,520
I gave birth to a kid like that?

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,960
Noona...

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,870
Ji Eun Oh wasn't my birth sister?

8
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,570
 

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,910
She witnessed the entire situation.

10
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,490
I have to go. I'll go now.

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,020
Okay.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,940
Yes, I'm coming.

13
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,050
I'll be about five minutes late
because of traffic.

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,440
Thank you for your cooperation.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,970
We'll move the vehicle.

16
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,460
Good.

17
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,020
Oh, no...

18
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,770
Director.

19
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,830
He's into Yeong Ra?

20
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,420
Of course, he is.

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,960
We have two left out of 20.

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,450
These two don't have anything notable.

23
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,220
There aren't any risky elements, either.

24
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,230
As you know, they're married.

25
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,670
They have two children each as well.

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,670
Did you find out why he quit his previous job?

27
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,880
As for Mr. Ham, his wife
didn't like his previous job

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,290
as a security guard since his hours were too irregular.

29
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,170
But he applied for a job that
requires him to work past 10.

30
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,910
Mr. Ryu quit when a broadcasting
company executive retired.

31
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,170
Why didn't they renew his contract?

32
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,550
Look into it further.

33
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,830
Look into what further?

34
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,810
I see a flaw.

35
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,160
Don't you see it, Team Leader Shin?

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,100
Oh, yes.

37
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,510
Ham Myeong Su and Ryu Beom Seok.

38
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,410
I'll find out their real reasons for quitting.

39
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,020
I sent the payment.

40
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,330
You're also looking into Seonggol Group, right?

41
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,680
Of course. Thank you.

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
The master bedroom.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,800
Wow. Master bedroom.

44
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,610
You have a brand new apartment now.

45
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,210
Right, Building President?

46
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,730
Please be careful.

47
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,530
You might get paint on you.

48
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,960
Be careful.

49
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,800
You get to design it yourself,

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,960
and you only manage the project, right?
They got all the workers, too.

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,210
Is that true?

52
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,580
I designed it however I wanted.

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,770
- However I wanted.
- How impressive.

54
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,410
Would you like to see the walk-in closet?

55
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,370
- Yes, yes.
- Let's check it out.

56
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,950
Manager Ji, your eyes look sunken.

57
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,670
Are you sick?

58
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,560
No. I'm tired because I've never managed
two constructions at the same time.

59
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,340
Are you tired, sick, or heartbroken?

60
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,540
You're always so guarded.

61
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,460
I'll be chubbier for the Mapo project.

62
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,700
Mom.

63
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,960
Hey, Gang Oh.

64
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,900
 

65
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,540
What's this?

66
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,070
What is it?

67
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,790
"Ji Eun Oh, adopted on November 15, 1999."

68
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,410
Is this true?

69
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,110
You...

70
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,070
You went home saying you were sick.

71
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,490
Where did you find this?

72
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,270
Reported by Ji Yeong Min. Adoptor, Jung Sun Hui.

73
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,420
It's you and Dad.

74
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,460
Was Noona adopted?

75
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,980
So...

76
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,020
But how did you find this? Where?

77
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,140
I found it in Dad's renunciation
of inheritance folder.

78
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,540
Why did you look through that?

79
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,260
Is that important? It says Ji Eun Oh
isn't my birth sister.

80
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,430
Do you know how I feel right now?

81
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,420
Yes, well...

82
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,040
yes...

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,980
You must be in shock.

84
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,820
But Gang Oh, Gang Oh, Gang Oh...

85
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,620
Eun Oh is your sister.

86
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,900
- She's our daughter.
- She's not your birth daughter!

87
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,870
And she's been treating me like that
without knowing anything.

88
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,230
I'll tell her.

89
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,680
She knows.

90
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,880
Don't do anything silly.

91
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,970
She knows?

92
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,370
 

93
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,100
 I'm so stressed since I've been
doing nothing but work for weeks. 

94
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,100
 

95
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,700
 Let's play for just an hour. 

96
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,470
 It's the leader's order. 

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,340
 When, Leader? 

98
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,260
 Let's leave together when I arrive in 15 minutes. 

99
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,780
 Okay? 

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,630
Okay.

101
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,930
When can I start the first project
after signing the contract?

102
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,530
We're signing with two more homes.

103
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,770
You'll hear from the coordinator
in a couple of weeks.

104
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,350
How did you come up with a platform like this?

105
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,190
I got an inspiration like it was meant to be.

106
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,690
I'm here.

107
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,390
Huh? What's that?

108
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,790
It's nothing.

109
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,390
 

110
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,160
What a relief. I'm right on time, right?

111
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,970
You are. Give me a moment.

112
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,490
Are you ready?

113
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,390
Okay. Take care.

114
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,690
- Okay. Let's talk soon.
- Okay.

115
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,200
What brings you here in the middle of the day?

116
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,670
Well, we have a plan.

117
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,840
A plan?

118
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,470
Let's get going.

119
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,310
Where are the three of you going?

120
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,140
You don't have to know. It's just among us.

121
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,300
Just among us?

122
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,370
Thank you, Min Woo. I'll be back soon.

123
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,860
Okay.

124
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,870
Hey, Ji Eun Oh!

125
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,090
I heard you knew.

126
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,990
You knew that you weren't my birth sister!

127
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,230
You were adopted?

128
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,650
You knew, but you bullied me as a sister?

129
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,550
Gang Oh, talk to noona privately.

130
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,020
Noona?

131
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,520
You aren't even my birth sister,

132
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,260
but you've been bullying me,
who's not your birth brother?

133
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,690
Hey, come here.

134
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,810
What? What's with you guys?

135
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,720
Let go!

136
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,810
Hey.

137
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,620
Wake up. This is a cafe open for business.

138
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,420
Are you really Eun Oh's brother?

139
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,670
Aren't you old enough to know
not to blabber your mouth?

140
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,990
Don't you care about her?

141
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,600
Why should I care about her?

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,310
She's not even my birth sister.

143
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,660
And who the hell are you?

144
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,880
- I'm Ji Eun Oh's sunbae.
- I'm Ji Eun Oh's sunbae.

145
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,900
How are you her sunbae?

146
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,920
She called me sunbae before I joined the company.

147
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,490
Didn't you know?

148
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,270
Why do you interfere?
You have nothing to do with this!

149
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,180
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

150
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,070
- Wow...
- Hey,

151
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,550
do you want us to beat you up?

152
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,600
Things have gotten so lax.

153
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,130
You two...

154
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,590
Please go inside.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,750
Watch your mouth.

156
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,130
I saw Mom's text.

157
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,520
I heard you confronted her first.

158
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,660
Yes. I already confirmed.

159
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,680
Even the fact that you knew
you weren't related to us.

160
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,220
Yes.

161
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,450
I first heard about it when I was in 9th grade.

162
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,850
But I don't know why you're so angry.

163
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,460
I'm Mom and Dad's daughter.

164
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,670
And you're my brother.

165
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,170
Our parents decided that,
and we've been living that way.

166
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,520
Then, you should've just been their daughter.

167
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,070
You aren't my sister.

168
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,340
You took all the money I could've had.

169
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,530
What did you say?

170
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,780
Gang Oh, what did you say just now?

171
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,630
Why do you think I gave up on soccer?

172
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,190
I was 10 when Dad's business failed.

173
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,920
I quit taking private lessons then.

174
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,190
Because you spent the money I could've had.

175
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,870
Jang Seon Wu, who's in the national team now.

176
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,050
Because of you, I couldn't
take the lessons when he did.

177
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,390
How could you say such a thing?

178
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,880
We're siblings, Gang Oh.

179
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,650
We aren't real siblings.

180
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,170
We aren't related.

181
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,190
You knew all that, but you
pretended to be my sister.

182
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,630
You scolded me, told me to get my act together, and save money!

183
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,790
How shameless.

184
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,800
You bastard. Seriously...

185
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,640
- Will you keep blabbering on?
- Yes!

186
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,630
Just like now.

187
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,360
As if you're my real sister.

188
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,300
I find this enraging and unfair.

189
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,790
Before Dad's business failed,

190
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,830
you took all sorts of lessons,
including piano, ballet, and art.

191
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,660
They were all private lessons, too.

192
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,940
All of that money could've been spent on me.

193
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,200
And Dad might not have gone bankrupt.

194
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,880
If he saved all the money he spent on you.

195
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,780
Well...

196
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,470
I have nothing to say right now.

197
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,960
Of course, you don't.

198
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,770
You have no right to say anything to me.

199
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,250
So, what do you want?

200
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,120
I don't know!

201
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,130
You fix everything.

202
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,970
Hey, you were all here.

203
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,550
Director, I'll cancel the plan today.
Sorry, Su Jeong.

204
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,300
Where are you going?

205
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,370
Mom's shop.

206
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,930
Gang Oh won't be there. I should
help with the dinner shift.

207
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,900
Right now?

208
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,280
Buy us dinner next time, then.

209
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,620
Okay.

210
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,830
Gosh, I need a drink.

211
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,790
Don't you dare go by yourselves.

212
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,470
 Come to Agit in 30 minutes. 

213
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,080
 20,000 won per hour. Oh Su Jeong will pay you. 

214
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,900
Did you also not know, Ji Hyeok?

215
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,600
- Not even a clue.
- Of course not.

216
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,910
Eun Oh is so devoted to her family.

217
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,250
She saved up desperately for
four years while working for Doogle,

218
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,710
got her mom a shop, and a new place, too.

219
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,720
Although it was a semi-full-term lease.

220
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,910
Eun Oh did?

221
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,590
Eun Oh got her a shop?

222
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,860
She didn't just help out with it?

223
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,140
Was it when the shop was opening?

224
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,200
I went there once to help out.

225
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,710
I found out because her mother told me.

226
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,420
She saved for four years at Doogle because...

227
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,430
You knew Eun Oh the best.

228
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,610
You didn't even know that?

229
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,780
Her father's business failed
when she was in the 10th grade.

230
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,090
He passed away when she was in 12th grade.

231
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,930
I knew they were struggling.

232
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,610
She always worked part-time
and tried to get scholarships.

233
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,230
She probably couldn't open up fully.

234
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,650
I thought I knew her situation well enough.

235
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:36,510
People don't always share everything.

236
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,350
Hello?

237
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,520
Yes. Right now?

238
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,740
You can come right now. Okay.

239
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,500
Eun Oh, Gang Oh went to see you, didn't he?

240
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,560
What did he say?

241
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,120
We're busier than usual today.

242
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,160
I was going to close, but the customers came in.

243
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,800
Why would you close? It's not a holiday.

244
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,510
How could I work?

245
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,250
Mom, you don't work because you're in the mood.

246
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,240
You work because you have to.

247
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,330
That sounds familiar.

248
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,960
That's what Dad said.

249
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,350
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

250
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,380
- We'll have more pickled garlic.
- Okay.

251
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,500
And two more bottles of soju, please.

252
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,830
- I'll bring them right out.
- Okay.

253
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,880
Adopted?

254
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,060
How could her brother talk to her like that?

255
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,470
And how could Eun Oh go to
help her mom after that?

256
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,510
You've got to be kidding me.

257
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:00,610
And why do I feel betrayed by her right now?

258
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,770
Betrayed?

259
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,840
We were close since college
when we met at the club.

260
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,170
When Agit first opened,

261
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,860
she got me that job, so I no longer
had to work part-time jobs.

262
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,110
She still didn't have to tell you she was adopted.

263
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,390
That's not what I'm saying.

264
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,400
I mean, her personality.

265
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,090
She's always been extremely positive.

266
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,400
She's cheerful, energetic,
unwavering, and confident.

267
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,700
She seemed like someone else earlier.

268
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,210
She wasn't the person I knew.

269
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,500
How could she live like that
when she had a situation like that?

270
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,160
Now that I think about it,

271
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,690
except for when we ate at school and club dinners,

272
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,400
we ate out only a handful of times
for years while working at the cafe.

273
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,450
She said her favorite was triangle gimbap.

274
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,130
She told me it was gukbap.

275
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,840
She and her mother are very close.

276
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,430
She also said she loved her late father very much.

277
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,460
 

278
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,880
 My club juniors insisted on
throwing me a birthday party. 

279
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,130
 I gave up. 

280
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,220
 So, meet me there. 

281
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,930
Is she dumb?

282
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,230
Thank you. Hold on.

283
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,980
Daebak.

284
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,940
It wasn't ruined at all. It's perfect.

285
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,790
- Pardon?
- I baked this myself.

286
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,590
It's the birthday of someone important.

287
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,970
Oh, I see.

288
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,640
What a relief.

289
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,080
- Thank you.
- Sure.

290
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,130
Thank you so much.

291
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,290
What a silly kid.

292
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,360
Birthday?

293
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,310
 

294
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,920
 Come home now, wherever you are. 

295
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,510
 You're having dinner at home tonight. 

296
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,410
 Come this way! This way! 

297
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,980
 
Noona, come here for a second.

298
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,340
Two, three.

299
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,180
 Hello, we're Hangyeol Value. 

300
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,450
Hello. Are you here to sign up for the club?

301
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,720
Well, no.

302
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,410
You're here to hear about it, then.

303
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,050
I'm so glad you came.

304
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,760
Our club does really fun and exciting projects.

305
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,750
School and job prepping are so stressful.

306
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,500
Sometimes you want to be
fully immersed in something.

307
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,910
And when you start fixing up and decorating homes,

308
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,620
all unnecessary thoughts disappear.

309
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,040
And it's extremely exciting
when the project finishes.

310
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,760
It's even rewarding.

311
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,880
Oh, really?

312
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,070
Yes. Well...

313
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,480
So, by chance, are you an architecture major?

314
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,160
Did I talk too much before asking?

315
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,010
I'm a business major.

316
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,660
I see. You're really interested
in volunteer work, then.

317
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,750
This would be perfect for you, then.

318
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,840
You get to do volunteer work
and relieve stress, too.

319
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,070
Yes.

320
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,090
Sign up, then.

321
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,250
I'm Lee Ji Hyeok from the 16th class.

322
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,040
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

323
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,740
Huh?

324
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,070
Did you say Lee Ji Hyeok just now?

325
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,710
That Lee Ji Hyeok?

326
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,190
Gosh. We've waited for you to return to school.

327
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,520
- Guys.
- Yes?

328
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,590
It's Lee Ji Hyeok from the 16th class.

329
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,500
- Hello, Sunbaenim.
- Hello.

330
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,150
- Get back to it.
- Okay.

331
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,040
You were Lee Ji Hyeok.

332
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,120
Nice to meet you.

333
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,400
I'm Ji Eun Oh, the 19th class.

334
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,290
I'm in your care.

335
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,060
We'll see how it goes.

336
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,890
I'll do well.

337
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,230
You will?

338
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,580
Yes.

339
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,980
You're hopeless, aren't you?

340
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,320
 
I'm hopeless when it comes to what I love.

341
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,540
Ji Hyeok,

342
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,480
I need to get going now.

343
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,710
What?

344
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,080
I was summoned by my father.

345
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,430
If so,

346
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,990
we should get going, too.

347
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,810
We're leaving already?

348
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,170
In such a bad mood?

349
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,000
I have to be at the job site early tomorrow.
I'm working as a laborer.

350
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,440
What?

351
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,480
It's nothing.

352
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,940
I even invited Hye Na.

353
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,970
I'm still in shock about Eun Oh.

354
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,540
You'll still be in shock even
if you drank all night.

355
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,560
Let's go. You're done, right?

356
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,980
It's cassia seed tea.

357
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,160
Your eyes seemed tired yesterday.

358
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,530
Thank you.

359
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,660
Seong Jae needs to come so you can have dinner.

360
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,470
Let's see if he makes me hungry or not.

361
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:42,780
By the way, since when did you know
CEO Min of Hyeonyu Fashion?

362
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,390
Why do you ask? It's unlike you.

363
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,640
Pardon?

364
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,940
You were never interested in the company.

365
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,490
I don't bring work matters home, either.

366
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,320
Oh, right. Since he's such
a big figure in the industry.

367
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,120
I guess I was fascinated.

368
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,590
Aren't you hungry?

369
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,460
Seong Jae isn't here yet.

370
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,740
Yes, Seong Jae.

371
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,290
Are you sure you're actively
looking for his future wife?

372
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,920
You don't seem rushed.

373
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,240
I knew you'd notice, but...

374
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,980
But?

375
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,810
I wasn't exactly doing nothing.

376
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,030
I was just being cautious.

377
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,930
Cautious?

378
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,930
This is my second marriage,
but not with just anyone.

379
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,250
I have nothing to show for.

380
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,710
I want to meet your standards.

381
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,490
I want to find a future daughter-in-law
you'd be happy about.

382
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,400
But the business community isn't so accepting.

383
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,000
So, I keep feeling intimidated.

384
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,640
I wasn't able to call that many people.

385
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,900
Seong Jae says he isn't ready, either.

386
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,850
I used that as an excuse. I'm sorry.

387
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,380
We remarried years ago. Why do you...

388
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,440
How dare anyone criticize Park Jin Seok's wife?

389
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,070
Of course, they do. Why wouldn't they?

390
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,730
My first marriage was humble.

391
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,850
I'm not from a wealthy family, either.

392
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,270
I'm not well educated, and
my former job wasn't impressive.

393
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,590
You still think that way?

394
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,400
Honey...

395
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,170
You're tenacious, but so impossibly delicate.

396
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,570
Here's the car key.

397
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,220
Yes. Thank you.

398
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,860
Thank you.

399
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,040
 I won't have dinner until you come. 

400
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,040
I thought you had something to tell me.

401
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,760
A family should eat together sometimes.

402
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,530
Why do you refuse to eat at home?

403
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Because I get out of work late.

404
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,420
Why do you work overtime?

405
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,520
You aren't even devoted to the company.

406
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,500
He'll get indigestion.

407
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,690
I didn't make his favorite LA galbi
for you to ruin it for him.

408
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,810
Tell me what you wanted to say. I'll listen.

409
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,900
You left the office this afternoon
and were out for the rest of the day.

410
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,540
What were you up to?

411
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,950
 

412
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,100
I'm sorry to interrupt the meal,

413
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,810
but I must take this call, Honey and Seong Jae.

414
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,170
What are you up to?

415
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,380
Are you wasting your life away?

416
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,520
Playing video games and stuff?

417
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,530
I do play video games.

418
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,210
Pathetic bastard.

419
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,120
This is why you need to get married.

420
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,340
You need to find a woman like your mom.

421
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,370
By my mom,

422
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,980
which one did you mean?

423
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,180
No, Ms. Jeong. I reached out
because I wanted to see you.

424
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,380
 What do you mean by which one? 

425
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,600
You bastard.

426
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,800
You have only one mom.
How many times did I say so?

427
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,800
She cheated on me and abandoned you.

428
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,500
Do you still think of her as your mom?

429
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't think you should try
to control how I feel.

430
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,900
A human can abandon her husband,
but not her child.

431
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,880
She left you when you were too young
to remember. You call her a mom?

432
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,360
What kind of person does that?

433
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
She's an animal.

434
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,080
Why would you say something so ridiculous?

435
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,770
Are you dating someone ridiculous, by chance?

436
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,470
Tell me.

437
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,970
Why did you leave without notice today?

438
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:46,930
You know, that's why I'm working at your company.

439
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,960
I've told you before.

440
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,510
Without my freedom as your successor,

441
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,250
I can't last there.

442
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,990
Park Seong Jae,

443
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:00,840
a tiger without teeth can't eat anything.

444
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,420
You only get rotten meat someone leaves behind.

445
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,420
Sit.

446
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,750
I said we should talk after we're all done.

447
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,330
No. Let's talk now.

448
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,050
You're frustrating me to death.

449
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,320
What did Gang Oh say?

450
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,280
I guess he was very shocked.

451
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,440
He asked why I played ignorant.

452
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,070
He went all the way there to ask that?

453
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:46,610
Did he have to yell at you for that?

454
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,170
He was in shock.

455
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,920
How could he not have flipped out?

456
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,310
Did he flip out?

457
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,730
How much? What did he say?

458
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,100
He flipped out like he always does.

459
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,780
It'll be okay.

460
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,530
But you're his older sister.

461
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,790
He's still so immature, Eun Oh.

462
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,220
You're just his sister.

463
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,740
Of course.

464
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,250
What can he do?

465
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,260
What's he going to do about it?

466
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,890
Mom, you're done with the kitchen, right?

467
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,600
Go get changed. Let's go home.

468
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,650
 Park Seong Jae, 

469
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,670
 a tiger without teeth can't eat anything. 

470
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,220
 You only get rotten meat someone leaves behind. 

471
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,860
I'm young.

472
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,030
But I'm already a tiger without teeth.

473
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,400
 Noona? 

474
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,940
 You aren't even my birth sister, 

475
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,500
 but you've been bullying me,
who's not your birth brother? 

476
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:31,100
A tiger without teeth probably
has no one around him.

477
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,450
He doesn't even have the energy to eat.

478
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,610
He has no energy to fight, either.

479
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,160
He's probably out with his friends.

480
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,760
Will it take about a week?

481
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,290
What kind of a man gets shocked by stuff like that

482
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,370
and get angry because no one told him?

483
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,540
He's using this as an excuse to let it out on me

484
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,620
since I refuse to do what he wants.

485
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:16,220
When will he finally mature?

486
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,720
In about a week?

487
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,170
You want to sleep here? Aren't you scared?

488
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,840
If I say I am, will you sleep with me?

489
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,050
What?

490
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,450
No, no. Don't get the wrong idea.

491
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,470
Not sleep together. I meant, as a bodyguard.

492
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,670
A security guard or something like that.

493
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,210
You're 30 years old.

494
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,180
You should know what not to say.

495
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,430
But you'll leave me here, anyway.

496
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,860
Yes. You said you've slept here many times.

497
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,610
All right.

498
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,700
It might not look like it,

499
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,590
but it's pretty cozy to sleep here.

500
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,530
I even took your all-nighter spot from you.

501
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,850
Why did you come so early?

502
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,690
Ma'am?

503
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,260
To check the paint and the cleaning status.

504
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,050
Since we're refinishing the wall,

505
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,280
I mopped the floor and vacuumed twice.

506
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,580
I'll mop one more time later.

507
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,110
You came early.

508
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,600
We shouldn't get the wall dirty.

509
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,490
This vacuum... It works well.

510
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,890
Our company needs to get one, too.

511
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,380
I'll send you the model number.

512
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,020
She clearly stayed up all night.

513
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,920
She's good at acting normal.

514
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,260
What did you say?

515
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,640
Well...

516
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,090
I mean...

517
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,860
Did you really know? I mean about yesterday.

518
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,310
I knew.

519
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,740
Since when?

520
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,980
Never mind.

521
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,750
Good morning.

522
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,410
You woke up early today, Su Bin.

523
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,190
It's because I haven't seen you in a while.

524
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,040
Good morning.

525
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,470
You, too?

526
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,450
Well, yes. Me, too.

527
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,330
I was told to see him before Dad forgets my face.

528
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,770
Yes. I'm glad you told them, Da Jeong.

529
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,310
- Right, Mother?
- Yes.

530
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,710
They don't even eat breakfast. Why...

531
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,080
It's your fault, Dad.

532
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,940
Why are you always out?

533
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,290
Don't you ever rest?

534
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,720
That's why we never get to see you.

535
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,900
I know.

536
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,880
Dad, you look very tired.

537
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,200
Did you lose weight?

538
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,080
It's because he studies obsessively.

539
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,960
Ji Wan, how's working as
Seong Jae's sister's driver?

540
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,490
You seem to leave early in the morning.

541
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,760
Of course, I should. I can't make
Ji Hyeok look bad.

542
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,260
Who cares about him?

543
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,800
Do it for Seong Jae.

544
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,150
Don't say that.

545
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,580
Things will work out for Ji Hyeok soon, too.

546
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,720
Su Bin, what are you doing today?

547
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,930
I'm painting the storage.

548
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,250
I'll go to the paint shop to get the paint mixed

549
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,660
and paint in the afternoon.

550
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,760
Hey. When are you leaving?

551
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,710
I'm meeting Ha Eun at the subway station at 10.

552
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,880
I see. Let's go out together, then.

553
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,820
Are you going somewhere, too?

554
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,100
Right, Myeong Suk.

555
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:16,180
Isn't she the lady who ran
Myeong Suk Hair Salon in Tongyeong?

556
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,170
Dong Cheol and I were in the same grade.

557
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,100
Huh? N-No.

558
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,060
It's a different Myeong Suk.

559
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,980
Looks like you had many friends in Tongyeong.

560
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,420
No. She always prepped fish
at the Fishers' Union Center

561
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,370
and stayed at the hospital because of Grandpa.

562
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,700
I don't think she had time to make friends.

563
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
Don't act like you know.

564
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,550
Since you were busy with your life,

565
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,700
you never paid attention to me.

566
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,170
Mother,

567
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,840
are you always meeting your friend
on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays?

568
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,870
N-No.

569
00:36:54,870 --> 00:37:00,970
Myeong Suk and the senior center friends
tell me to come every day.

570
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,740
But I can't go out every day, leaving you alone.

571
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,630
It's okay, Mother.

572
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,950
Go out every day.

573
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,240
 

574
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,000
 

575
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,820
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

576
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,980
Can I ask you a favor?

577
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,770
I need to email a resume,

578
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,830
but I don't know how to add a file.

579
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,910
Could you help me?

580
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,440
I've told you this before,

581
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,520
but you can't give out two flyers.

582
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,200
- You can't throw them away, either.
- Okay.

583
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,820
 

584
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,360
Hello?

585
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,030
Yes, this is Eunoh-ism.

586
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,310
Yes, a quote?

587
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,260
By Monday?

588
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,880
Could you email me the plan and requirements?

589
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,920
A quote in this situation?

590
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,360
Will she overwork herself to death?

591
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,710
- Geez. What a fool.
- Send me the email address...

592
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,470
Excuse me.

593
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,230
Here.

594
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,070
Yes, go ahead. Yes.

595
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,080
I'll wash the handkerchief and return it.

596
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,690
Of course, you should.

597
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,440
I'll finish the rest.

598
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,750
Go home and rest today.

599
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,120
Why?

600
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,410
I know about the flooring.

601
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,140
I learned something, too.

602
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,130
That's what you think.

603
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,040
You might trust yourself,

604
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,910
but I don't trust you.

605
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:01,100
A coordinator's job is to oversee
everything from start to finish.

606
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,480
Fine. Fine. Fine.

607
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,470
Geez. She's so stubborn. So annoying.

608
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,580
I shouldn't have hired her.

609
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,870
I was wondering how Eun Oh was doing.

610
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,520
 I have no idea. 

611
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,710
 I'm curious, but I can't call her. 

612
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,280
She's probably at the job site.

613
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,370
 Of course. 

614
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,960
She does her job even if the sky splits in half.

615
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,060
Okay, then. Got it.

616
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,170
I'll let you know when it's ready.

617
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,480
- Thank you.
- Sure.

618
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,300
Director, Eun Oh won't be here anytime soon.

619
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,820
I wanted to deliver this.

620
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,780
Don't tell her it's from me.

621
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,620
Let's say you're giving it to her.

622
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,640
It's a heart supplement and multivitamins.

623
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,260
She must be in shock.

624
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,730
Okay. I'll take all the credit.

625
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,980
By the way, is Ji Hyeok with her?

626
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,310
Probably.

627
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:09,970
He also cleans afterward since he's a laborer.

628
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,980
 Seong Jae, I have plans, too. 

629
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,540
 I want to do this without anyone's help. 

630
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,320
 Can you start a business in such a short time? 

631
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,400
 In just a few months? 

632
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,220
 You think so little of me, don't you? 

633
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,920
 Whether it's from you, my parents, or anyone, 

634
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 I refuse any help. I'll go down if I have to. 

635
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,160
 He's a laborer now? 

636
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
 I guess he really meant it. 

637
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,280
Well, then.

638
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,750
Geez. Are you crazy?

639
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

640
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,770
Aren't you Sang Cheol?

641
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,480
Dong Gu? Choi Dong Gu?

642
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,720
Wow. How funny.

643
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,100
I can't believe I ran into my high
school classmate like this.

644
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,630
Hey.

645
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,610
It must've been tough.

646
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,600
You're in the middle of Siberia
right after you retired.

647
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,090
How about you?

648
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:40,050
You were a branch manager
for Yurin Bank, but you deliver now?

649
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,260
Did you get scammed by chance?

650
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,350
Yes. By my son.

651
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,370
After he returned from studying abroad

652
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,970
he asked for help to start a business.
But I couldn't say no.

653
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:58,600
After I told everyone not to give
money away to your child.

654
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,840
Your kids are always an exception.

655
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,490
By the way, I'm glad you didn't get
into an accident because of me.

656
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,790
I know.

657
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,690
My wife and kids don't know that I work.

658
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,800
I lied that I set money aside.

659
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,540
They think I hang out at a friend's office.

660
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,400
How did you end up this way?

661
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,300
I could tell you were a newbie,
handing out flyers.

662
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,750
You were so awkward.

663
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:30,340
It's because I can't have a long-term job.

664
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,240
Hey,

665
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,980
we were good students, class presidents, too.

666
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,050
We never thought we'd be like this at our old age.

667
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:45,580
I know. Life is so funny.

668
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,200
What about your parents?

669
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,900
My father passed three years ago.

670
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,950
Mother is living with me.

671
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,820
I heard your father got injured in a boat accident.

672
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,760
Has it been about 30 years?

673
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,660
My father was on his boat.

674
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,190
- Was he?
- Yes.

675
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,610
I can't remember since it's been so long.

676
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:17,280
By the way, how long have you
been supporting your parents?

677
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,420
Hey, let's split the bill.

678
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,950
We're on the same boat.
We can't treat each other anymore.

679
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,620
I'll pay.

680
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,680
Excuse me.

681
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
The owner is coming home late today.

682
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,140
I texted her. She'll send the payment.

683
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,440
Please clean up the rest.

684
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,080
Yes. I'll send a quote in two days.

685
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,420
Yes, I checked the email.

686
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,090
She's going to Mapo and putting
together a quote tonight?

687
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,540
Does she want to die?

688
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,550
Geez. Whatever.

689
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,800
I shouldn't have set up an office at the cafe.

690
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,600
I'll move out as soon as I find an investor.
It's better not to see her.

691
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,400
Why does she have to be so unfortunate?
She worries me.

692
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,360
Take everything out from the inside.

693
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,320
Hello.

694
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,790
- I'm here.
- Hey.

695
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,870
Manager Ji,

696
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,620
your face got so thin in just a day.

697
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:36,100
Maybe I couldn't sleep because
I worried you'd destroy everything.

698
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,080
Gosh.

699
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,140
Go ahead and check.

700
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,830
- Okay.
- Okay.

701
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,700
Should I get her a heart supplement or something?

702
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,860
Her brother was flipping out on her.

703
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,140
Gosh, whatever.

704
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,840
There's no way she'll accept it from me.

705
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,770
I should make Su Jeong give it to her.

706
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,700
Hold on.

707
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,190
If we're doing the flooring today,

708
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,930
the construction will end in three days.

709
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,840
Lee Ji Hyeok, are you stupid?

710
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,630
You need to pay her the balance, 18 million won.

711
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:22,140
You said you'll pay her 20 million.

712
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,790
Tama Bank promised a loan without collateral.

713
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,130
What's taking them so long?

714
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,600
 Hello, Custom Homes' proposal
for investment passed the first round. 

715
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,360
Hey, Sunny.

716
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,600
Why are you so lazy?

717
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,100
What took you so long?

718
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,280
I got this.

719
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,830
I'm pitching to two companies.
I'll get at least one.

720
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,560
Yes. I will. I'm sure of it.

721
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,690
Hello.

722
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,840
I won't sleep here tonight.
Make sure to lock the doors.

723
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,510
Why aren't you...

724
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,280
Lock the door securely. I won't be here.

725
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,800
Where's he sleeping, then?

726
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,230
Does he have a girlfriend again?

727
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,850
I'm here.

728
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,600
Eun Oh.

729
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,010
Don't look at me like that. I feel uncomfortable.

730
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,430
Come on.

731
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,290
Did you have a fight with Ji Hyeok again?

732
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,050
Why did you come in separately?

733
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:38,050
I was coming from the Mapo site.

734
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,930
He probably finished up at the other site.

735
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,640
Ji Eun Oh, I'm going to have an oat milk latte.

736
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,840
Join me. It's on me.

737
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,290
Okay.

738
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,740
You heard me, right? Two.

739
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,180
Two.

740
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,880
How was yesterday?

741
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,000
Sorry, Su Jeong. I need to work.

742
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,570
Hey, stop being so ridiculous.

743
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:07,850
Do I mean so little to you?

744
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,860
I'm just really busy today.

745
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,140
I got a quote request.

746
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,900
- And you'll do it?
- Yes.

747
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,300
You can work here all night tonight, then.

748
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,540
Ji Hyeok said he's not sleeping here tonight.

749
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,720
He told me to lock the doors securely.

750
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,290
Really?

751
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,410
 I'll give you a call. 

752
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,130
 

753
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,600
 36-pyeong apartment with
three bedrooms and two bathrooms. 

754
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,530
 I want to turn one of the rooms into two rooms. 

755
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:44,790
 If you design your home and come up with a budget, 

756
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:48,970
 Custom Homes will recommend
the appropriate materials. 

757
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,340
My hands are going numb.

758
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,700
Just 10 phone calls today, huh?

759
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,640
Let's get one person, at least.

760
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,560
Hello, this is Custom Homes.

761
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,370
Yes. I'm calling about your request.

762
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,870
Who is it?

763
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:23,120
I'm picking up my mat and sleeping bag.

764
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,720
Over here.

765
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,650
Hey.

766
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,500
You need to take something.

767
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,180
A heart supplement?

768
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,130
Where did you get this?

769
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,730
I bought it.

770
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:02,480
And my sister-in-law sent this
to my mom for her birthday.

771
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,220
But my mom doesn't like it.

772
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,580
So, I thought about selling it online, but...

773
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,630
Okay. Thank you. Lucky me.

774
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,390
So bitter.

775
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,060
She's taking care of herself.

776
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:29,690
Did you get her the heart supplement?

777
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,250
Seong Jae did.

778
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,630
The multivitamins, too.

779
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,240
Seong Jae?

780
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,640
Bye now.

781
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,310
What is he, her boyfriend?

782
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,980
 

783
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,350
 

784
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,190
Hello, I'm Lee Ji Hyeok.

785
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:45,220
Oppa, play different music.

786
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,520
I forgot.

787
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,630
I was playing my music on the way.

788
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,340
Thank you.

789
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,810
Of course.

790
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:56,150
Yeong Ra, you have no appointments today.

791
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,860
Is it okay to drop you off and do
my thing for a few hours?

792
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,670
I'm not sure.

793
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:05,290
I can't guarantee that my mom won't call you.

794
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,180
So, are you saying I can't?

795
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,640
I'm saying I'm not sure.

796
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,960
Why won't your mom tell you in advance?

797
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,570
You're an adult.

798
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,800
She plans things for me without
telling me for my own benefit.

799
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,700
Whatever.

800
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,050
I have a very important plan today.

801
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,290
I'll drop you off and do that later.

802
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,080
You think drivers don't have lives?

803
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,110
I work nine to nine. 50-minute lunch breaks.

804
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,560
I work on weekends and have one weekday off.

805
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,080
I can't even meet up with my friends.

806
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,810
You're right.

807
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,970
You rarely go out, by the way.

808
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,280
I know you're preparing the solo show, but still.

809
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,900
Don't you want to go out?

810
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,170
I don't.

811
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,080
How could you not?

812
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,420
Don't you want to see your friends?

813
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,110
Not really.

814
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,330
Everyone hangs out with their friends,

815
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,180
but that doesn't make it a rule.

816
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:07,150
There are exceptions and unique
cases in this world.

817
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,720
Do you need a reason to see your friend?

818
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,780
A friend. Just a friend.

819
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:17,970
You must have a friend, right?

820
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,180
People have different definitions of a friend, too.

821
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,480
Gosh. How frustrating.

822
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,790
Oppa, please focus on driving.

823
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,650
I'm leaving.

824
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,660
Ta-da.

825
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,280
This is what I wore on my first date

826
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,770
with my first boyfriend. Isn't it so bling-bling?

827
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:15,240
If I layer this with overalls,

828
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,280
which was my favorite as a kid...

829
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,730
Hi, Su Bin. That looks tasty.

830
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,010
Hurry, Park Seong Jae.

831
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,220
Here. It's tasty chocolate.

832
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,560
Wow, chocolate. You're the best.

833
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,700
Seong Jae, Ji Hyeok ate my jjondeugi.

834
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:00,290
I'll get you something tastier.

835
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,740
Let's go.

836
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:10,410
Su Bin sleeps whenever you carry her.

837
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,270
 Wow. They look delicious. 

838
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:17,570
Thank you, Seong Jae.

839
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,870
 Thank you! 

840
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,500
Enjoy.

841
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,400
Seong Jae, is it nice in the US?

842
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,820
I want to visit, too.

843
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,970
- Isn't it so good?
- It is.

844
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:37,890
 This is why Seong Jae thinks of me as a child. 

845
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:40,070
 I would if I were him, too. 

846
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,020
- Su Bin.
- Huh?

847
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,120
What do you think? Doesn't it look good on me?

848
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,110
 

849
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,300
 

850
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,130
 

851
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,960
These aren't right.

852
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,980
Geez. What do I wear?

853
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,450
 

854
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:23,360
Hey, Su Bin.

855
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,400
You want to meet up?

856
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,180
You said to call you if something's up.

857
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,990
Why? Is something going on at home?

858
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:34,960
No. I need to discuss something with you.

859
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,460
I'm not asking you a favor.

860
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,290
We need to talk in person.

861
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,070
Really?

862
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,690
Okay. When do you want to meet?

863
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,130
Welcome.

864
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,690
Hello. I'm Lee Ji Wan, CEO Lee Ji Hyeok's brother.

865
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:18,780
Nice to meet you.

866
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,580
Oh, hello.

867
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,700
Lee Ji Wan.

868
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,980
What?

869
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,410
A businessman has to have a good style.

870
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,040
You have all these nice clothes and shoes.

871
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,470
Why would you wear cheap stuff?

872
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:43,740
I was going to wear that to pitch
in front of investors tomorrow.

873
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,580
Really?

874
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,400
Was I a clairvoyant?

875
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,370
How did you bring all this, Ji Wan?

876
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:53,430
I snuck them out without anyone noticing.

877
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,800
You know how to be clever.

878
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,400
You're so useful.

879
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,300
Everyone is useful sometimes.

880
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,800
Oh, where's a nearby laundromat?

881
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,800
We need to iron these. They wrinkled on the way.

882
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,280
It's okay. I'll do it.

883
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,630
I'm so touched.

884
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:10,900
Really?

885
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,420
You'll be shocked when you see this.

886
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,530
I brought your car, too.

887
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,850
Whoa.

888
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:26,540
You came early.

889
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,250
I'm done early because it was
a window installation day.

890
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,000
- By the way, outside-
- Thank you for taking care of my brother.

891
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,440
Well...

892
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,440
Say hello. This is CEO Ji Eun Oh of Eunoh-ism.

893
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,370
Oh, nice to meet you.

894
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:47,530
I'm the brother of CEO Lee Ji Hyeok
of Custom Homes.

895
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,470
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

896
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,700
- Let's go.
- Okay.

897
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,640
- I'm in your care.
- Sure. Bye.

898
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:02,260
He's so polite.

899
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,910
He's nothing like his brother.

900
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:06,660
I was wondering what the car was doing outside.

901
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,390
I washed it by hand.

902
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,680
Thank you. I'm glad you brought it today.

903
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,430
But I have an important plan today.

904
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,030
I need to get going, too.

905
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,630
I'm a driver who's always on standby.

906
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:28,480
Right. By the way, Ji Wan-

907
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,650
I'm leaving, Hyung.

908
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,620
Thank you.

909
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,530
Gosh. What a relief.

910
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:41,980
I got this.

911
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,760
I'll pay Ji Eun Oh in time.

912
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,080
I don't need a lender.

913
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,530
I was so scared.

914
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,890
 

915
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,830
 

916
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,790
Ta-da.

917
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,370
Why are you here again?

918
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,630
You need me to get more customers.

919
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,020
We got an order. I'll go.

920
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:29,130
Hello, everyone. I'm the CEO of Custom Homes...

921
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,870
DIY interior design...

922
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,510
I'm Custom Homes' CEO, Lee Ji Hyeok.

923
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:49,660
How did it get so late?

924
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:25,010
What's he doing?

925
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,370
 

926
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,030
 

927
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,620
 

928
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:59,800
 

929
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,530
 

930
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,800
 What business? It's all for show. 

931
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,500
 Is running a business a joke? 

932
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,640
 To launch a homepage in two months? 

933
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,060
 If he were to do that, why not do it sooner? 

934
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,370
 Why bother working for someone else? 

935
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:29,100
 If I share a space with you, 

936
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,950
 will you die, Ji Eun Oh? 

937
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,740
 I'll die. 

938
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:10,000
 ♫ The moonlight shone on me ♫ 

939
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,160
 ♫ When I looked up in the sky, you ♫ 

940
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:23,530
 ♫ You, it was you ♫ 

941
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:28,470
 ♫ I try to ignore you ♫ 

942
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:35,530
 ♫ But my heart is always filled with you ♫ 

943
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:42,860
 ♫ I think it's always been you ♫ 

944
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:48,930
 ♫ The moonlight shone on me ♫ 

945
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,770
 ♫ When I looked up in the sky, you ♫ 

946
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:57,910
 The unstoppable Lee Ji Hyeok is back. 

947
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,760
 I'll invest in Custom Homes. 

948
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,020
 Aren't you being pretentious? 

949
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,830
 A businessman can't do that. 

950
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:06,330
 Let's go, Oppa. Locking arms
isn't a big deal between us. 

951
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:08,310
 Stop nagging. 

952
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:10,000
 How dare you nag me? 

953
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,790
 Why do you keep criticizing? 

954
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:14,830
 Ji Eun Oh, you might hate me forever, 

955
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:16,570
 but you're just Ji Eun Oh to me. 

956
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:19,040
 Eun Oh! Are you okay? 

957
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,800
 You can't live in this house
if you don't give me the money. 

958
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,490
 Who are you related to? Why are you so shameless? 

959
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,800
 Where are you from? 

960
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,900
 ♫ When I looked up in the sky ♫
