1
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,580
 

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,630
What...

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,510
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,100
Ji Eun Oh...

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,450
I wanted to tell you something.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,800
Tell me what...

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,930
I mean, I don't think you have
anything to say to me.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,720
I do.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,560
- What-
- I'll sleep over here tonight.

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,830
What did you say?

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,020
Let me sleep in the cafe.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,620
Are you out of your mind?

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,060
Why would you sleep here?

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,280
Here?

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,520
As far as I know, it's still
a cafe for Hangyeol Value.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,430
So, one of the alumni sleeps over every so often.

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,730
Like Ji Eun Oh...

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,370
But I'm this cafe's manager.

19
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,130
You're a manager, not an owner.

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,560
A manager has the authority
over this cafe's maintenance.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,160
I don't have a place to sleep.

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,900
You have your home in Seoul and
hotels, motels. There are tons-

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,400
I don't have the money to sleep elsewhere.

24
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,090
Good night.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,920
I'll give you money for a motel. So, get out.

26
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,000
Do I still look like a joke to you?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,430
You didn't even call in advance,
and you barged in to sleep here?

28
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,880
No way. Get out.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,300
If I don't?

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,030
- Will you drag me out?
- I said I'll give you money for a motel.

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,140
Why would I go elsewhere
when I have a place to sleep?

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,700
I mean, did he come back crazy?

33
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,690
This makes no sense.

34
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,760
How could he act like that?

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,500
It's still cozy and comfortable.

36
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,680
How could he show up looking like that?

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,510
No, how could he show up in front of me?

38
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,440
Does he think I'm that soft?

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,360
He knows I mean it when I say no!

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,930
But why?

41
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,970
Why does he want to sleep in the cafe?

42
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,850
If he's in Seoul, he should go home.

43
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,340
But there's no blanket. Where's he going to sleep?

44
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,340
No way...

45
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,040
Ji Eun Oh, that stubborn one...

46
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,350
It's so uncomfortable on the floor.

47
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,360
She must've slept here.

48
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,570
What the heck? Did he use my sleeping bag?

49
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,180
What's this?

50
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,530
Did you clean the storage?

51
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,360
He must be in the restroom.

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,870
Look!

53
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,800
And he didn't even clean up.

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,030
Who? What's with the toothbrush?

55
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,020
Does he think this is his house?

56
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,560
He left his bag and all this.

57
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,740
Where did he go?

58
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,800
Who?

59
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,970
- Lee Ji Hyeok.
- What? Lee Ji Hyeok?

60
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,210
Ji Hyeok was here?

61
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,710
He slept here last night.

62
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,640
He slept here?

63
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,530
Hey! Where did he go? Hey!

64
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,770
 

65
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,690
I was shocked that Lee Ji Hyeok
was here to see me.

66
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,270
Now that I see you, I'm even more shocked.

67
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,250
But it's good to see you, Ji Hyeok.

68
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,680
Are you doing well, Sunbae?

69
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,710
What's with you? When did
"noona" change to "sunbae"?

70
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,190
I know, huh?

71
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,240
I have 10 minutes.

72
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,460
I have a client meeting in 30 minutes.

73
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,110
Is 10 minutes enough?

74
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,050
- Have a seat.
- Noona.

75
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,360
There's an item I want to revive.

76
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,840
So, I need an office.

77
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,300
Can you let me use the storage of the cafe?

78
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,980
I'll pay you 200,000 won a month in rent.

79
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,410
You want to start a business, huh?

80
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,620
Yes.

81
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,170
And what else?

82
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,570
- What do you mean?
- What's the item?

83
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,890
I can't tell you that in 10 minutes.

84
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,500
I'll tell you after I clean up the storage.

85
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,080
So, I just have to let you use the storage?

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,730
What's this? It's so simple.

87
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,130
It didn't even take five minutes.

88
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,160
I have one more request.

89
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,660
Su Jeong.

90
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,600
I have a meeting this morning

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,920
so I'll take an iced Americano to go.

92
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,170
Don't upset Eun Oh.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,810
Why? Is something wrong?

94
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,420
Ji Hyeok barged in last night
and slept in the storage.

95
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,450
Ji Hyeok came by?

96
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,100
- Is he in the storage?
- No.

97
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,900
When Eun Oh came to work,
he was gone, leaving his bag behind.

98
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,730
If Ji Hyeok shows up again, call me right away.

99
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,020
- Okay.
- I'll get coffee another time.

100
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,570
I know it's mostly trash,

101
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,780
but you can't throw it out without a trash bag.

102
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,600
Sunbaenim.

103
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,840
I'm here to see you, Eun Oh.

104
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,400
Ji Hyeok wants to start a business.

105
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,790
He wants to use the storage
as his office, so I told him to.

106
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,500
An office?

107
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,900
- Sunbaenim, that's...
- Eun Oh.

108
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,180
I want to look after Ji Hyeok.

109
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,110
You know his situation.

110
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,300
He wants to try it, and I want to help.

111
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,980
He'll use half of that storage.
He'll pay rent, too.

112
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,170
So, collect 200,000 won from him.

113
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,060
Well, he'll work in the cafe

114
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,100
but I'm sure he'll buy his coffee.

115
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,440
You'll be the most inconvenienced.

116
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,420
After the cafe closed, you used it alone
as your office and a studio.

117
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,930
But still, you've known each other for so long.

118
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,950
I'll leave it to you.

119
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,510
Okay. I understand.

120
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,790
 Ji Hyeok is back. 

121
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,570
If you block this way, it'll be difficult
for us to get our supplies.

122
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,490
I'll set it up, so it doesn't.

123
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,910
Talk after you see everything set up.

124
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,690
What's your reason?

125
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,870
The reason you showed up with Hyeon Su.

126
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,800
It's just as she said.

127
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,330
I want to start a business, need an office,
and have limited resources.

128
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,020
So, you want me to be understanding, right?

129
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,870
That's where I am.

130
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,910
Hey, are you all right?

131
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,440
What if I'm not?

132
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,590
Hyeong Su approved. I have no choice.

133
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,140
I know.

134
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,820
Ji Hyeok is so smart.

135
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,200
But what kind of business is he going to start?

136
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,270
A customer.

137
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,720
Okay.

138
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,530
One ice Americano, please.

139
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,680
- 5,000 won.
- Okay.

140
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,130
I'll bring it over.

141
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,710
Will you? Thanks.

142
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,570
 

143
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,760
 

144
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,040
 

145
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,500
 

146
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,960
Here you go.

147
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,200
Thanks.

148
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,320
Have you been well?

149
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,030
Yeah.

150
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,116
 

151
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,100
Yeolmu?*
(Buy and sell app)

152
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,200
 I shut down my office and
am getting rid of all office supplies. 

153
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,660
Where is he?

154
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,310
Ji Hyeok.

155
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Looks like you're Su Jeong's friend.

156
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,800
Let's go out. Let's talk over lunch.

157
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't feel like lunch. I have work to do, too.

158
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,360
What happened?

159
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,980
Wait. I'm busy right now.

160
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,430
Lee Ji Hyeok.

161
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,720
Seong Jae, let me take care of my things first.

162
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,620
No. Talk to me first.

163
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,560
You've become so rude. Park Seong Jae.

164
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,690
I asked you what happened.

165
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,080
Are you asking why I came or why I'm here?

166
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,020
Tell me exactly what you want to know.

167
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,820
Everything, man!

168
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,500
What brought you here?

169
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,020
Never mind that. Why didn't you
call me before you came?

170
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,190
And why are you here?

171
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,840
I heard you slept here last night.

172
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,740
You want me to tell you everything?

173
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,710
Isn't that obvious?

174
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,160
Why should I have to tell you everything now?

175
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,170
Are you getting angry at me?

176
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,890
I was doing something important, Seong Jae.

177
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,460
So, give me my cell phone.

178
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,540
If you have something to say, go and wait.

179
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,480
Seriously.

180
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,990
I shouldn't have told him.

181
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,800
So, why did you tell him?

182
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,540
They're friends.

183
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,580
But he didn't tell him himself.

184
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,620
Park Seong Jae.

185
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,110
Seong Jae.

186
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,380
Don't tell my family.

187
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,310
Is that what you came out to tell me?

188
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,690
Yeah.

189
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,840
Why should I?

190
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,370
Why should I do that?

191
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,230
Because you can't.

192
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,570
You have no right.

193
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,040
Hey, Lee Ji Hyeok.

194
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,980
Do you know how long I've known your parents?

195
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,970
And who let you do that?

196
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,170
First, you shouldn't do what your
friend doesn't want you to.

197
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,640
Second, that's meddling
in someone else's business.

198
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,600
You came here without letting me know at all.

199
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,400
And you don't think about my position?

200
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,900
Just don't contact them.
Why are you whining about it?

201
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,200
Ji Wan is working as Yeong Ra's temporary driver.

202
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,100
Su Bin-

203
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,600
I'm doing something with Su Bin, too.

204
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,400
Everyone is so worried sick about you.

205
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,650
And you want me to lie to their faces?

206
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,570
While I've been away,

207
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,610
a lot has changed.

208
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,050
I know.

209
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,640
Gosh, you stickler.

210
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,470
Did I tell you to lie?

211
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,670
Just don't say anything.

212
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,030
For how long?

213
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,590
I want to let my family know myself.

214
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,280
I don't want them to hear it from someone else.

215
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,980
"I'm back, and I want to start a business.

216
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,690
So, don't worry and just wait
for me." After saying that,

217
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,760
I don't think I can handle their
questions. Not yet anyway.

218
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,000
You should've said so sooner.

219
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,660
But what business?

220
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,560
What kind of odd idea are you coming up with?

221
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,050
Later.

222
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,600
Telling you now means nothing.

223
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,010
You'll probably think this.

224
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,750
"Ji Hyeok is being so prideful."

225
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,400
I'll call you.

226
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,870
What's he thinking?

227
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,770
You had a nightmare last night and couldn't sleep.

228
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,970
Are you sleepy or sick?

229
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,960
I'm tired and sleepy.

230
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,000
Sleep more. I'll be back.

231
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,660
I made lunch. Eat with Mother before you go.

232
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,760
No. I'm fine. I had a late breakfast.

233
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,220
- See you.
- Okay.

234
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,280
Aigoo, that fool.

235
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,750
Why did he even leave this money behind

236
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,460
and think of going into that woman's
house empty-handed?

237
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,950
You didn't leave yet?

238
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,390
What's that?

239
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,480
Oh, it's nothing.

240
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,710
Honey, what's that?

241
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,850
- Let me see.
- No.

242
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,790
It's a check.

243
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,700
The one I had given to Ji Hyeok.

244
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,660
Eighty million won? That money?

245
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,950
That 80 million plus his 20 million.

246
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,260
He left 100 million under his pillow.

247
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,730
I found it on the morning of the wedding.

248
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,270
And you didn't tell me that?

249
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,320
I mean... I mean...

250
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,490
I thought since he had that money...

251
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,980
I thought Ji Hyeok was traveling
abroad or staying somewhere...

252
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,990
That's why I was able to hang on.

253
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,190
I was waiting.

254
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,870
You knew all that, yet you didn't let me know?

255
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,110
If I had told you, you'd be worried like this.

256
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,470
No. No...

257
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,470
That's not it.

258
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,610
I would've called him every day.

259
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,300
Telling him to be back safely...

260
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,710
I would've left a voicemail, texted him,
and begged him. Everything.

261
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,140
I would've done that every day.

262
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,450
And I had no idea...

263
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,140
How could he come back when
his parents aren't looking for him?

264
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,850
How could he bring himself to come back?

265
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,550
Should he have to earn his living
while he's hiding away?

266
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,550
He'll be fine without this money.

267
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,950
He was getting ready to move out.

268
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,940
Why are you so worried about him?

269
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,780
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol!

270
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,750
Were you even listening to me all this time?

271
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,300
I don't have a son named Lee Ji Hyeok.

272
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,200
I know. That's right.

273
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,040
Who does he take after anyway?

274
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,310
Of all places,

275
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,260
Ji Hyeok was standing at the edge of a river

276
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,320
and was crying silently.

277
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,930
No matter how much I called out,
"Ji Hyeok, come here. Come here."

278
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,460
He wouldn't budge at all.

279
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,630
Did you not tell me in case I got mad?

280
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,810
At least, I thought he had
some money and was calm.

281
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,710
What did you think while watching me?

282
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,050
I shouldn't just sit here like this.

283
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,830
 You're so proud. Good for you. 

284
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,130
 Father like son! 

285
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,950
He's not a son to you?

286
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,120
Not me. He's my son!

287
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,270
I saw Ji Hyeok in my dream last night

288
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,640
and couldn't sleep at all, and was so worried.

289
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,280
Da Jeong.

290
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,830
Did you dream about Ji Hyeok, too?

291
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,500
Mother...

292
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,610
You had a nightmare, right? Me, too.

293
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,260
Sang Cheol, should we report him missing?

294
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,530
Gosh, Mother, please...

295
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,380
What if Hyeok can't get over his shame

296
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,460
and can't find any other way?

297
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,350
Mother, what are you saying?

298
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,790
Ji Hyeok isn't that weak.

299
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,270
How could you both be so calm
when you're his parents?

300
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,610
I'll go to the police station.

301
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,070
Stop right there, Mother.

302
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,390
Ji Hyeok is my son.

303
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,040
Did you give birth to him?

304
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,940
How do you think I feel?

305
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,120
Do you think I'm less worried
about him than you are?

306
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,390
Why do you say such a scary thing?

307
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,030
Da Jeong...

308
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,010
He's human, too. After that humiliation,

309
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,220
how could he show up only after a month or two?

310
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,130
He couldn't. He can't.

311
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,290
Do you think I'm feeling just fine?

312
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,200
I'd tell myself, there's no way.
I trusted that there's no way.

313
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,670
But my heart shrinks a thousand
times throughout the day.

314
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,820
But we should still wait.

315
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,870
Why file a missing report? That's so scary.

316
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,770
He said he'd come back.

317
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,350
He told me he'd come back...

318
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,450
Right.

319
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,150
Da Jeong...

320
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,410
is the mother.

321
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,390
She was holding it in.

322
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,000
She was just holding it in.

323
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,830
I thought Da Jeong was just calm...

324
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,270
and I thought I was the only one
frustrated and scared.

325
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,400
But she must've been feeling terrible.

326
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,940
She's the mother.

327
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,690
Father, did you have an appointment?

328
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,130
No.

329
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,980
I was bored, so I was going to go for a stroll.

330
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,850
While living 87 years,

331
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,750
all kinds of things happen.

332
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,450
Nothing is out of the realm.

333
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,000
Father...

334
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,540
Yeah.

335
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,390
I wonder how Ji Hyeok is doing right now...

336
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,270
Are you crying?

337
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,190
Father...

338
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,720
You have a call.

339
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,380
Just leave it. It's probably Sang Cheol.

340
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,880
It's not Sang Cheol. It's just a number.

341
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,440
Hello?

342
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,680
 Mom, it's Ji Hyeok. 

343
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,450
Hey. Give me a moment.

344
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,270
Hi, Ji Hyeok. Are you doing all right?

345
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,920
 Yes. 

346
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,920
I called in case you were worried sick about me.

347
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,890
I see.

348
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,330
I'm glad you did, my son.

349
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,040
Mom.

350
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,090
Yeah?

351
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,260
 I just... 

352
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,760
You don't have to worry about me.

353
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,110
But I need some more time.

354
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,480
Of course. I'm sure.

355
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,170
 You're not sick, are you? 

356
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,560
I'm fine. I eat well, too.

357
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,600
 Tell Grandma, too. 

358
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,350
I will.

359
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,390
I want to ask you so badly

360
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,660
where you are and when you're coming home.

361
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,170
But it doesn't mean much to you now.

362
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,170
Of course, you're so sensible, Mom.

363
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,170
You'll be home when it's time, right?

364
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,750
Yes, Mother.

365
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,170
 Okay. I got it. 

366
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,800
Sang Cheol says he's coming by.

367
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,500
- There he comes.
- Yes.

368
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,950
Father.

369
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,030
I'm sorry. I couldn't call you
due to Ji Hyeok's issues.

370
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,770
No. Don't be sorry.

371
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,880
Are you trying to save face with me?

372
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,110
A job offer could get pulled.

373
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,850
Here. Eat this and get stronger.

374
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,750
Aigoo, you take it.

375
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,310
Take it.

376
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,170
Father kept it for a while.

377
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,550
Okay. Thank you.

378
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,990
So, what brings you all the way here?

379
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,730
Why are you on the phone out here?

380
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,010
None of your business.

381
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,140
Take her with you.

382
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,800
You must've cried in front of your father.

383
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,860
I guess you're not angry anymore.

384
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,510
Ji Hyeok just called me.

385
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,470
He says he's fine.

386
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,060
He says he's fine, so don't worry about him.

387
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,710
That was the call?

388
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,270
Yeah.

389
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,710
Since he sounded okay,

390
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,400
I feel better, too.

391
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,300
What other choice does he have? He did all that.

392
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,600
Whether he was right or wrong,

393
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
you know he's the one struggling the most.

394
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,500
However you think or feel, I don't like that guy.

395
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,070
What are you doing?

396
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,230
Because of him last night,
I couldn't check yesterday's sales.

397
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,360
Min Woo, check how many scones. The number is off.

398
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,780
Okay.

399
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,570
Careful.

400
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,940
He must've bought a desk already.

401
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,080
And the empty beer bottle box
is full. Take it outside.

402
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,410
Okay.

403
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,040
Did you already buy a desk?

404
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,830
Yeah, office goods were listed on Yeolmu.

405
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,040
So, I bought them all.

406
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,810
Yeolmu?

407
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,340
Are these all used?

408
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,650
What's this?

409
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,910
A cot.

410
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,550
I'll sleep and work here.

411
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,530
You'll sleep here...

412
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,420
You mean, you'll live here?

413
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,500
Yeah.

414
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,300
If you bought all this for
200,000 won, you hit the jack-

415
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,050
Let's talk for a second.

416
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,620
Is this why you went to see Jeong Hyeon Su?

417
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,070
To shut me up?

418
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,860
Yeah.

419
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,620
Were you this selfish?

420
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,400
I thought you already knew the
worst of me from back then.

421
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,100
 What you wanted in the end 

422
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,400
 was getting rich and successful. 

423
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,570
 That was it. But you acted as if it wasn't. 

424
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,960
 As if you care about the weak and justice. 

425
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,330
 As if you weren't getting married to live freely. 

426
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,600
 I'm angry that you've been deceiving me like that. 

427
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,500
 I realized my favorite person
was the kind I hate the most. 

428
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,920
 So, I'll forget about how I behaved,
having been deceived 

429
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,830
 and the disgusting behavior that
appeared to be out of friendship. 

430
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,250
 I'll forget about them. 

431
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,390
 Don't act like you know me from now on. 

432
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,000
I thought I knew everything about you.

433
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,690
But I didn't know you'd be even worse.

434
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,720
Are you telling me to see you here night and day?

435
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,580
When you know how I feel about you?

436
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,680
When you know I pull all-nighters here at times?

437
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,340
When you pull all-nighters and take naps,

438
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,170
I'll stay quietly in my office.

439
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,000
And stay in the same space throughout the night?

440
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,830
Just think of me as a stranger. An invisible one.

441
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,910
I'll do my best to shorten this stay.

442
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,300
But I can't promise anything.

443
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,510
You went to the cafe owner to tie me up

444
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,700
and now you want me to think of you as a stranger?

445
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,340
As expected of you, Ji Hyeok.

446
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,060
If it's just a headache, you're doing well.

447
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,060
Your head should be exploding at this point.

448
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,960
Why is this day so long?

449
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,280
Try going to Hyeon Su.

450
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,030
Tell her everything.

451
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,940
I'd rather quit.

452
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,390
Hey.

453
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,360
Oh?

454
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,580
I guess he's actually going to start a business.

455
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,920
I wonder what business he's starting,
even setting up an office.

456
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,580
Will you be okay?

457
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,050
I'll think of him as an invisible man.

458
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,680
That's what he wants as well.

459
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,250
Gosh, it's suffocating.

460
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,140
Hey, can you work this weekend?

461
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,160
Let me shorten my shift.

462
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,140
So, when is your show?

463
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,420
It's coming up soon.

464
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,720
So, when is that?

465
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,820
Why do you ask?

466
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,250
Can't I ask?

467
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,020
It's not something you need to know, Driver Lee.

468
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,740
What?

469
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,290
What did you just say? "Driver Lee"?

470
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,690
Yes.

471
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,300
Did your family find a driver yet?

472
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,030
I haven't heard anything.

473
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,080
Hey, I'm not your driver.

474
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,250
Seong Jae asked me...

475
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,220
so I'm doing this temporarily.

476
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,180
And since you're younger than me,

477
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,920
I'm here to help you like a little sister.

478
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,410
How dare you act like a madam?

479
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,890
Hey, I've been holding it in, but

480
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,340
if I knew you were so rude,

481
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,850
I wouldn't have done this
even if your grandpa asked.

482
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,160
My mom told me you're a driver.

483
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,570
Really?

484
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,690
What should we do? I don't want to do this.

485
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,790
- Pardon?
- You know how to drive, right?

486
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,210
Yes.

487
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,110
Then, you drive.

488
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,710
I'm not doing this.

489
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,230
Oh, no...

490
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,500
Who the heck does she think she is?

491
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,680
She never says hi and ignores
me when I talk to her.

492
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,990
Fine. So, I was just a driver to her, huh?

493
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,370
Far from it.

494
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,280
Since the pay was good and with things at home,

495
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,490
I was going to bear through it.

496
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,590
But geez, I can't stand someone so rude like that.

497
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,220
Damn it.

498
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,190
 There's this dangerous stalker 

499
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,160
 and we haven't caught him yet. 

500
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,940
 Yeong Ra has a huge trauma from it. 

501
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,480
She's scared?

502
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,610
She's just arrogant.

503
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,350
 I think I can entrust her to you, Ji Wan. 

504
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,390
 Thanks in advance. 

505
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,550
Damn it!

506
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,120
What's the deal?

507
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,560
What's she doing?

508
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,590
Hey, open the door!

509
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,990
Hey, open the door!

510
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,290
Hey, Park Yeong Ra!

511
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,330
You really do get scared...

512
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,490
Don't worry.

513
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,630
I'll protect you.

514
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,800
Yeah...

515
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,300
O-Open the door.

516
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,530
I'm sorry.

517
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,730
Well...

518
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,420
I'm sorry.

519
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,140
Me, too.

520
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,870
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,550
"I'm sorry"?

522
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,350
Did you learn sign language?

523
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,050
When? Why?

524
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,640
It's past 10 minutes.

525
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,470
My mom will call me.

526
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,030
The traffic in Seoul isn't like the subway.

527
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,270
We didn't move for 10 minutes.

528
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,570
What's that supposed to mean...

529
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,610
We could've gotten into a fender-bender.

530
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,500
Okay. I guess they live in a different world.

531
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,860
Put your seatbelt on.

532
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,540
Hey, Park Yeong Ra.

533
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,370
Will you keep calling me "Driver Lee"?

534
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,580
Your mom also knows that
I'm Seong Jae's friend's brother.

535
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,070
And she said I'm a driver?

536
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,160
Just because you have a younger sister my age,

537
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,940
it doesn't mean you could be my oppa.

538
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,140
I see. That's how it is in your world.

539
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,500
Okay. I got it. I'll accept that.

540
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,620
Keep calling me "Driver Lee."

541
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,650
Then, do I have to call you "my lady"?

542
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,940
No. Not that formal...

543
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,060
Hey, Madam is coming out.

544
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,510
What took you so long?

545
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,340
There was a fender-bender.

546
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,790
Not us, but three cars ahead of us.

547
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeong Ra, did the car jerk you around?

548
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,350
Are you hurt?

549
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,570
No.

550
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:00,460
It wasn't us. It was three cars ahead of us.

551
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,250
Gosh, I see.

552
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,610
Gosh, I'm so glad.

553
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,330
Thank you.

554
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,880
Okay, let's go.

555
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,780
I'll see you tomorrow.

556
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,450
Geez, can't stand the sight of them all.

557
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,000
Dad, I'm home.

558
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,890
You look happy today, Yeong Ra.

559
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,440
Anything good happen?

560
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,420
It was the same as yesterday.

561
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,500
Is Driver Lee good?

562
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,040
You asked her that yesterday, Honey.
The day before, too.

563
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,430
I'm just concerned.

564
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,460
If you can't trust Seong Jae's friend's brother,

565
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,490
how would you trust the new driver we hire?

566
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,750
Did you find a new driver?

567
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,080
Gosh, if it were that easy,
why would we hire a temp one?

568
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,700
And Seong Jae's friend's brother
at that. It's uncomfortable.

569
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,340
Why are you uncomfortable? Seong Jae
recommended his friend's brother.

570
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:06,240
It's best not to involve
acquaintances, if possible.

571
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,140
You said the same thing.

572
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,650
If we make mistakes or cause any grievances,

573
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,600
Seong Jae would look bad.

574
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,670
You wouldn't do anything to hurt
Seong Jae's reputation, Honey.

575
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,220
Your mom is timid at times, Yeong Ra.

576
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,020
Yes. I'll go upstairs now.

577
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

578
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,050
My goodness...

579
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,310
Okay. There you go.

580
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,480
Aigoo, aigoo...

581
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,160
I can't even say thank you anymore.

582
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,120
How do you iron even my
undergarments without missing a day?

583
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,550
Gosh, doesn't your mouth hurt?

584
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,820
You'll get calluses on your mouth.

585
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,760
This is given.

586
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,490
It's your underwear. My husband's underwear.

587
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,340
You'd feel good if the first thing that
touches you is nice and fresh.

588
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,060
And what do you think of this
for your work suit today?

589
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,740
My wife, Ko Seong Hui.

590
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,940
You're so consistent.

591
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,380
I like what you choose

592
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,290
but you always ask me for my opinion.

593
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,060
You're an amazing woman.

594
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,590
My gosh, with your praises like that,

595
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,020
no wonder I do it even more.

596
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,530
Mr. Park Jin Seok, you're the smart one.

597
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,250
- Get changed. I'll check on Yeong Ra.
- Okay.

598
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,100
Look.

599
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,760
Yeong Ra, you're swollen. Why are you swollen?

600
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,070
I'm sure you didn't eat anything
except your salad for lunch.

601
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,570
I didn't eat anything else.

602
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,930
Did you do your morning stretches?

603
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,300
Or did you sleep on your tummy?

604
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,890
You don't take naps at the studio, do you?

605
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,910
I don't.

606
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,360
Then, why are you swollen?

607
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,170
I can't even lie down on the sofa at the studio.

608
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,440
Do I have to continue to work
alongside Artist Jang?

609
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,950
I think she could paint in her studio
and bring it over like she used to.

610
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,010
Did you forget already?

611
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,350
That stalker is still out there.

612
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,330
What if he's watching you in secret?

613
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:36,210
What if he sees the canvas go back and forth?

614
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,420
I told you nothing in life is free.

615
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,620
You can't earn anything
without sacrifice and hard work.

616
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,710
This is all for you.

617
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,700
We're doing this for you, Yeong Ra.

618
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,010
You're right, Mom.

619
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,950
Let's stop now.

620
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:04,200
To keep nagging my smart daughter

621
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,070
would hurt your pride.

622
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,840
 

623
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,860
Ms. Ko, are you wearing that perfume again?

624
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,680
No, I'm not.

625
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,250
I smell it, and you'd be lying if you say no.

626
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:50,130
I don't think you're gutsy enough to lie to me.

627
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,820
Gosh, you mixed it with fabric softener.

628
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,520
Yes. I didn't want to waste it.

629
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,640
Hey, I gave you a new perfume.

630
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,780
So, you can throw that one out.

631
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:10,000
And if you keep using it, that's like a scammer.

632
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,740
Don't show you're poor.

633
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,780
Did I give it to you for your sake?

634
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,360
I gave it to you for my nose's sake.

635
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,350
Go get changed right now.

636
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,340
Yes, CEO.

637
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,100
You got the list of the Sori members'
trading galleries and the curators' names, right?

638
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,560
Bring that to me.

639
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,330
A list of collection items as well.

640
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,710
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,250
- Thank you.
- Bye now.

642
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,940
Hello.

643
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,340
Long time no see, Hye Na.

644
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,260
Hi, Hye Na.

645
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,600
Are you here to meet a friend?

646
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,250
No. I'm here to meet Ji Hyeok.

647
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,580
Ji Hyeok? Why?

648
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,110
We're supposed to meet.

649
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:58,650
The storage is Ji Hyeok's office, right?

650
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,410
Hye Na, you made it.

651
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:03,600
Go in.

652
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,820
Okay.

653
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,360
Two iced Americanos, please.

654
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,980
Sure. I'll bring them in.

655
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,350
No. I'll wait.

656
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,200
This is the menu you mentioned last time.

657
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,930
I organized it and input it.

658
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,380
Okay.

659
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,960
Good job, Jeong Hye Na.

660
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,270
Without a company name or logo,
it looks a bit empty.

661
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,600
I've decided.

662
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,980
Go ahead and put the company name and logo.

663
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,640
Let's do the SEO work today, too.

664
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,050
Here.

665
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,680
You've done everything.

666
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,800
Of course.

667
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,400
Looks good.

668
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,390
They are sitting at a desk and talking
while looking at something.

669
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,860
How odd.

670
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,690
I know.

671
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:54,600
Ji Hyeok came back a different person.

672
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,100
Let's just work. I don't want to think about it.

673
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,890
Hye Na, come here.

674
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,310
What did you do with Ji Hyeok?

675
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:08,200
Ji Hyeok asked me to design a simple homepage.

676
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,000
What homepage?

677
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,680
He said everyone can see it
when the homepage goes up.

678
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,100
Oh, right.

679
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,670
You studied computer science.
You're Eun Oh's hoobae.

680
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,960
Is that why he asked you?

681
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,020
Yes.

682
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,350
Ji Hyeok came back two days ago, though.

683
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,240
I met him about 10 days ago.

684
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,510
- Where?
- In Seoul.

685
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,380
In Seoul?

686
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,300
You must be surprised that
I called you out of the blue.

687
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,430
Yes.

688
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:39,960
Hye Na, you're going abroad to study
a language after this semester, right?

689
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,090
- Yes.
- Before you go,

690
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,710
do you want a part-time project?

691
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,250
But Hye Na, you're so odd.

692
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,590
Why didn't you tell us you met Ji Hyeok?

693
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,860
Why do I have to tell you that?

694
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,810
He asked me about the job.

695
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,840
So, what did you guys do today?

696
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,960
SEO work.

697
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,310
Then, you're almost done.

698
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:01,450
Yes.

699
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,100
- I'll get going, then.
- Okay.

700
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,930
Hey, Eun Oh.

701
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,150
Is it possible to make a website in 10 days?

702
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,560
Well, you can do it in a few days
if you can keep it simple.

703
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,130
Wow, impressive drive, I must say.

704
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,250
Geez, I'm dying to know.

705
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,060
What kind of business is he trying to run?

706
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,980
What business? It's all for show.

707
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,390
For show?

708
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,190
He didn't want to hide any longer.

709
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,140
He wanted to return but was embarrassed
to come back empty-handed.

710
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,790
So, he had to pretend to do
something big as he returned.

711
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,200
Is running a business a joke?

712
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,350
To launch a homepage in two months?

713
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,930
If he were to do that, why not do it sooner?

714
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,940
Why bother working for someone else?

715
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,530
But he came back here. The headquarters.

716
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,280
Where the rumors spread the fastest.

717
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,570
That's why he came here.

718
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,740
"I'm here to make a comeback.

719
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,010
But the business isn't going well."

720
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:56,040
Then, he'd shut down and look for a job again.

721
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,650
Then...

722
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,970
- Then?
- He'd disappear.

723
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,220
From Hangyeol Value.

724
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,280
Ji Eun Oh, you're so clear-cut, but coldhearted.

725
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,300
While I knew him for 10 years,

726
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,960
he had never mentioned starting a business.

727
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,120
Launch a homepage in a few days?

728
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,590
Do you know how simple of a homepage it must be?

729
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,990
On top of that, who does business
only with a website these days?

730
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,120
You need an app.

731
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,230
 

732
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:35,530
 

733
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,000
Hyung, I was about to call you.

734
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,390
Yes. My homepage will launch soon.

735
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,320
I'll send you the link now.

736
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,850
It'll help you with the development.

737
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:53,090
Of course. Then, you invest.

738
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,540
I'll be sure to give you your share.

739
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,960
Hyung, I'm busy right now.
I'll call you back tomorrow.

740
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,390
Why is it so stuffy in here?

741
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,090
Should I buy a fan or something?

742
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,550
What?

743
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,570
When did it close?

744
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:58,430
What's the deal?

745
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,200
So weird.

746
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,640
What?

747
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,380
 I heard your brother's wedding was called off. 

748
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:37,120
Yes, that's what happened.

749
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,680
All of a sudden?

750
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,940
Your father is retired,

751
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,020
and your brother became unemployed.

752
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,870
Then, you've only got your looks, age,
and educational background.

753
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,150
These three things.

754
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,620
So what?

755
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,830
Because I only have three things going
for me, I can't have anyone better?

756
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,910
I know it.

757
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,590
What can you give up?

758
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:59,610
The man's looks, age, education,

759
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:03,580
family, job, assets. What will you give up?

760
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,500
Are you asking me to trim down to three?

761
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,520
Come on. That's not it.

762
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,470
Since you have two big positives,
like you're pretty and young.

763
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:16,760
Let's just give up two things.

764
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,300
Age and family.

765
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,230
Okay.

766
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,120
Good call.

767
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,490
Young men with good jobs
and assets are tough to find.

768
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,710
And you know what those men are like.

769
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:32,150
They hate poor women without any savings.

770
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:34,670
Instead, I didn't give up on his looks.

771
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,140
I hate guys like the man I met last time.

772
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,180
No Photoshop this time.

773
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,330
 

774
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,870
Hurts my ego.

775
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,550
 

776
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,510
 

777
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,210
The subscribers keep increasing.

778
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,360
I had around 30K a few days ago.

779
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,040
Who do you think is the reason?

780
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,630
Look at the comments.

781
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,460
 Is he your real boyfriend? 

782
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,550
 The height difference is ideal. 

783
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,690
 I can only wear sneakers
when I see my boyfriend. 

784
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,610
 Your outfits look good together 

785
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,230
 but I really want to see your boyfriend's face. 

786
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,550
 I like these concepts. 

787
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,850
 Please keep coming on the channel. 

788
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,810
 Please post the boyfriend's clothes info. 

789
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,910
 Can't you reveal the
boyfriend's face? So curious. 

790
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,260
It's explosive.

791
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,130
Only for Seong Jae, though.

792
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,860
Seong Jae is pretty hot.

793
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,170
How old did you say your older brother is?

794
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,800
My older brother?

795
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,670
He's 32.

796
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,790
He's 34 in Korean age.

797
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,610
He's quite a bit older than I am.

798
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:01,970
Hey, Lee Ha Eun, don't even think about it.

799
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,780
Seong Jae is a chaebol heir.

800
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,500
Really?

801
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:10,770
No wonder he looked so classy.

802
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,300
- That's not important right now.
- Huh?

803
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,720
As they say, strike while the iron is hot.

804
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,900
If I shoot with Seong Jae two more times,

805
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,720
the subscribers will hit the roof.

806
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,170
Ms. Kim, I'll stay late, so-

807
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:37,750
What's wrong?

808
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,500
Nothing.

809
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,980
It's okay that you can look at your phone.

810
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,870
But why are you so startled to see me?

811
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,120
Are they trashing me on the
company blog or something?

812
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,850
It's not that...

813
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,340
Someone who looks like you is on YouTube.

814
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,870
Who looks like me?

815
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:02,150
 When you go to classy exhibitions
or concerts with your boyfriend. 

816
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,550
 The point is the blue stripe shirt. 

817
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,780
This.. this is...

818
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:21,460
Is she crazy?

819
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,820
 Jinx. 

820
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,970
I was just about to call you.

821
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,410
 Hey, Lee Su Bin! 

822
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,940
Why didn't you keep your promise?

823
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,610
You said you'd only shoot below my neck.

824
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:34,300
If my acquaintances see this, it's totally me.

825
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,930
 When did you upload this? 

826
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,600
I uploaded it a long time ago. You just saw it?

827
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,940
You didn't say anything, so I thought it was okay.

828
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:45,770
You'd better re-edit this right now.

829
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:48,100
But I'm in front of your office right now.

830
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,190
I need to talk to you.

831
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,690
What?

832
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,900
You said you'd exclude my face.

833
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,800
You were going to do that.

834
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,500
That's why I didn't check.

835
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,310
Because I believed you.

836
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,140
But you know, Oppa...

837
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,310
Your silhouette is amazing.

838
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,380
If I cut you off at the neck,

839
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,060
it looked scary and looked bad.

840
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,750
But I still blurred you out.

841
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,300
You!

842
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,340
People who know me would
recognize me right away.

843
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,860
You barely blurred it.

844
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,670
Re-edit it and repost.

845
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:30,460
Then, do it two more times.

846
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,530
Lee Su Bin, you little!

847
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,640
Are you making a deal with me now?

848
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,380
Don't be cheeky. Re-edit.

849
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,670
And I won't go on your channel ever again.

850
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,540
I'll make sure I blur you out.

851
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,410
If Ji Hyeok were around,

852
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:51,480
I wouldn't be asking you.

853
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,420
I would've asked Ji Hyeok.

854
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,300
By the time Ji Hyeok is back,

855
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,410
it'd be nice if one of us...

856
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,810
had something solid going on.

857
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,150
Hey...

858
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,930
Ji Hyeok will be fine.

859
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,800
Don't worry about Ji Hyeok.

860
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,250
 

861
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,200
The contract terms are very detailed.

862
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,370
I did look over it a few times.
But I'm sure there's something missing.

863
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,750
Okay.

864
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,820
You barely ate dinner.

865
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,170
What's wrong?

866
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:41,330
Do you have something to say to me?

867
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,890
Well...

868
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:48,490
how much are our monthly living expenses?

869
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,440
Living expenses?

870
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,970
Why do you ask that all of a sudden?

871
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:54,450
You pretty much know.

872
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,600
I wasn't paying close attention.

873
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,660
What are the must-have expenses?

874
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,470
Mortgage on the principal
and interest, 830,000 won.

875
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,280
Necessary utility bills and actual spending

876
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,130
including health and national
pension, one million won.

877
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,080
Food and daily necessities, one million won.

878
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,610
Mother's pocket money, 200,000 won.

879
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,270
Father's living expenses, 500,000 won.

880
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,130
Your pocket money.

881
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:23,170
I wonder how much you'll spend now
that you're not going to work.

882
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,880
Geez, so scary.

883
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,090
The cost to run one household is...

884
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,970
We have a big family.

885
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,570
Why are you already worried?

886
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:38,280
Thankfully, we have your retirement
fund that Ji Hyeok left you.

887
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,940
W-Well, Honey...

888
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:49,150
I'm thinking of studying to take the
electrician certification test.

889
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,780
An electrician?

890
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:55,750
Yes. That's just the beginning.
Ultimately, it's to get a license.

891
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,160
If I get an electrician's license,
they say I can find a job easily.

892
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,200
But I can't take the test right away
since I studied humanities.

893
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,110
Instead, if I get a certificate
and work for a year,

894
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:11,320
then I can take the industry-set
certification exam.

895
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,490
And then, once I work for another year,

896
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,180
I'm qualified to take the license exam.

897
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,670
My gosh... It's complicated and
dizzying just listening to you.

898
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,610
If it's that easy to get a job as an electrician,

899
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,900
why don't science-major people do that?

900
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,360
Well, the exam isn't always easy
for people who studied science.

901
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,300
But you, as a humanities major, will do that?

902
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:40,400
I'll earn a living, go to the academy, and study.

903
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,400
How long does it take to get
an electrician's license?

904
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,910
On average, about six months to a year.

905
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:53,950
Mr. Lee Sang Cheol, aren't you overdoing it?

906
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,550
Even if it's a small job...

907
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:59,360
let's just accept our situation like others do.

908
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,760
What are you saying, Honey?

909
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,900
So, you want me to have no plans for the future

910
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,600
and just look for a job every day
and make ends meet?

911
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,420
When we have Ji Wan and Su Bin to marry off?

912
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,940
You're so funny.

913
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,670
You've already made up your mind.

914
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:16,570
What was all that preamble for?

915
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:21,180
Well, I just feel bad toward you. That's why.

916
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,810
There's no use in stopping you

917
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:27,120
and I don't even have the courage to stop you.

918
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,950
I don't have a solution.

919
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:33,050
So, trust me and wait about six months.

920
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:37,280
I'll get the electrician license and find a job.

921
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,930
But I have a condition.

922
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:44,020
No part-time job. Don't do it.

923
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,080
Just study.

924
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:51,800
T-Thanks for your permission.

925
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,790
Permission? You were just notifying me.

926
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,150
- Seong Jae.
- Hey.

927
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,750
You should've called me.

928
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:11,270
I don't think I have your number.

929
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,720
I'll give it to you.

930
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,270
Text me.

931
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,730
We have to go now.

932
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,430
We?

933
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,970
You're here.

934
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:25,440
Eun Oh, Director Park, and I are doing something.

935
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,020
Are you ready?

936
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,440
Yes.

937
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,400
Director, will you be okay dressed like that?

938
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,510
Shouldn't you change?

939
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,090
I'll do that next time.

940
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,140
Let's go.

941
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,550
Let's go.

942
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,110
Bye.

943
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,130
Sunbae, please lock up the place for me.

944
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,870
Were they that close?

945
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,950
I didn't think so.

946
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:02,120
"We"?

947
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,190
 

948
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,930
 

949
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:54,350
What's this?

950
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,730
Kkang Oh, did you drink last night?

951
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,490
You came home after 2 a.m.
You're the one who drank.

952
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,870
That's why Mom made hangover soup.

953
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,200
Me?

954
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,800
Mom, I didn't drink.

955
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,440
Why did you come home so late then?

956
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,860
Game. I told you I play once a week.

957
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,400
They say late bloomers don't know when to stop.

958
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,240
You think that's why? You needed
something to distract you.

959
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,410
There you go again, being rude
to your older sister.

960
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,880
I guess Kkang Oh doesn't need money these days.

961
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,690
Since you're not calling me "Noona" these days.

962
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:31,280
Is he finally mature?

963
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,310
My mouth is itchy, but I'll hold back.

964
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,240
Until it's the right time.

965
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,200
Sure, sure. Everyone has the right time.

966
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,340
Since the cafe is closed today,
eat breakfast and get some sleep.

967
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,000
I can't. I have to meet my client.

968
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,400
I got an apartment interior job,
so I have to go to the site.

969
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:04,660
It's too old, huh?

970
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,900
They lived 30 years without remodeling at all.

971
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,530
That's why this place needs a complete overhaul.

972
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,870
We might have to tear it all down,
including doors and windows.

973
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,400
That's what we plan to do.

974
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,020
It'll take about five weeks. What do you think?

975
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,080
We'll put our things in storage and
stay at my parents' place.

976
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,690
I have all the measurements,
so I'll start with a drawing.

977
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:24,080
Okay.

978
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,370
 I'll sleep and work here. 

979
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,720
There's no one at the cafe
since it's closed today.

980
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,260
Why should I be inconvenienced?

981
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,160
W-What's that?

982
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,020
I didn't know you were coming in today.

983
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,910
What the heck is all this?

984
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,700
There's no window in the storage.

985
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,100
It was so stuffy. I got permission from Hyeon Su.

986
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,050
I can see the cafe from my desk like this.

987
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,430
You have no idea how much I'm holding in.

988
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,570
You can't see me even
if I stand inside the storage.

989
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:43,400
Even if you stand up, you can't see me in there.

990
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,800
- I measured and put it on top.
- Why?

991
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,910
Why not just a window, so you can ventilate?

992
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,440
I wanted to, but I held back.

993
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,780
I guess you'd continue with this.

994
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,550
If I close the door, you'd get permission

995
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,690
from Hyeon Su to leave the door open.

996
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:02,020
Since it's stuffy in there,
you'd get Hyeon Su's permission

997
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,010
to work out in the cafe.

998
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,600
Since you got Hyeon Su's permission,

999
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:10,000
I can't say a word, but say "Yes, yes." Right?

1000
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,520
- Well, it's not that.
- It is.

1001
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,940
You even know how to be so low.

1002
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,490
Fine. I got it.

1003
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,320
Do keep at it.

1004
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:29,300
Cut me some slack, Ji Eun Oh.

1005
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,670
Cut you some slack?

1006
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:32,480
I won't make you uncomfortable anymore.

1007
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,410
Of course not.

1008
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:36,810
What?

1009
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:39,650
I'll quit.

1010
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,550
What?

1011
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,190
I'll quit...

1012
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,390
working as a manager here.

1013
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:05,180
 ♫ It's okay not to tell me ♫ 

1014
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:11,600
 ♫ Lean on me and close your eyes ♫ 

1015
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:16,200
 ♫ And you'll feel better ♫ 

1016
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,980
 ♫ It's okay to rest sometimes ♫ 

1017
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:24,450
 ♫ You've been working hard ♫ 

1018
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:26,930
 ♫ It's okay to pause for a moment ♫ 

1019
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,320
 - Help me, Noona!
- What is it? 

1020
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,830
 Is that important? 

1021
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:31,220
 Go ahead and fire me. 

1022
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,910
 I should get fired if I deserve it. 

1023
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:36,090
 I'll become successful
with YouTube and marry a rich man. 

1024
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:37,430
 Hey, are you out of your mind? 

1025
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:39,440
 Do your parents know? 

1026
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,510
 This is your best friend Lee Ji Hyeok's
first page of his new life. 

1027
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:45,720
 Mamdaero Jip*. 
(Means "Whatever you want-house")

1028
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,690
 Please keep these three things. 

1029
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:49,180
 Don't act like you know me. 

1030
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,670
 Don't say hi. 

1031
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:51,940
 Don't talk to me. 

1032
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:53,640
 Is that possible? 

1033
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,780
 Talk to me for a second. 

1034
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:58,060
 It's my first day. I'd like you to do it.
