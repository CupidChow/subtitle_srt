1
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,250
It's nothing to cry about. Don't cry.

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,290
I'm not crying.

3
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,220
It's nothing to cry about.

4
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,550
Without even knowing exactly
why you're rejecting me,

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,550
I won't cry foolishly.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,830
Okay.

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,940
Let's stop talking about this now, Eun Oh.

8
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,200
Let's go.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,230
I'll get you a taxi.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,850
- I'll go alone.
- You can't.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,560
You think I'd take a taxi you get for me?

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,230
- Yes.
- Why?

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,480
Because I will.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,290
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm your Sunbae.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,980
It's my job to care for my junior's safety.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,040
I'm like your guardian.

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,220
I won't let you leave alone.

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,560
In this dark alleyway after 11?

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,200
All right.

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,680
You and I never met today.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,490
Let's forget about today, Eun Oh.

22
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,640
The taxi is coming in 10 minutes.

23
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,620
Ji Eun Oh.

24
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,370
Ji Eun Oh!

25
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,030
Ji Eun Oh!

26
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,580
Ji Eun Oh!

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,010
Ji Eun Oh...

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,570
 I got a taxi. 

29
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,540
 I'm fine. 

30
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,000
 Send me a photo of the taxi. 

31
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,450
You shouldn't have told me,

32
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,260
Ji Eun Oh.

33
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,067
 

34
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,360
- Father.
- Hey.

35
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,730
When will you stop working overtime?

36
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,140
Soon.

37
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,590
Are you doing okay, Father?

38
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm doing fine, of course.

39
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,080
I'm busy seeing people I haven't been able to see.

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,500
I see.

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,010
Why?

42
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,030
It's nothing. Go to bed.

43
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,320
Okay. You go to bed soon, too.

44
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,670
 You want to turn me into a guy who gladly accepted 

45
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,700
 money for losing a job? 

46
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,410
 I like you. 

47
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,600
 I really like you. 

48
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,660
 We are incompatible. 

49
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,680
 I don't get... 

50
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,480
 What do you mean... 

51
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,300
Whatever.

52
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,210
She'll figure it out.

53
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,860
She shouldn't have said that.

54
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,420
Why do you always leave in a suit?

55
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,170
I said I've been meeting industry people.

56
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,360
And the fruit box...

57
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,310
Leave it as is. I'll take care of it.

58
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,460
Dad, why are you in a suit?

59
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,770
Since he wore suits his whole life,

60
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,540
he feels uncomfortable in casual clothes.

61
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,070
Do you need pocket money, daughter?

62
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,210
- Come in.
- No, Dad.

63
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,720
I don't need pocket money.

64
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,540
I'll go.

65
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,110
We should be providing living expenses. Seriously.

66
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,480
Oh, wait, Mother...

67
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,330
- Do you need clothes, Mother?
- Gosh...

68
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,000
Not at all.

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,730
Why would I need clothes?

70
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,690
I have enough to change outfits
every day for three years.

71
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,860
If you have so many,

72
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,670
- get yourself something tasty with this.
- Hey.

73
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,970
I still have plenty of money left.

74
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,370
Mother, stop saving your pocket money.

75
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,000
Just keep spending it.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,670
And let me know if you run out.

77
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,010
I'll be right back.

78
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,240
- Hey, Sang Cheol. Hey.
- See you later.

79
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,310
Where's he going to?

80
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,250
He has no job to go to

81
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,420
and no one to meet up with, either.

82
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,210
 Mother, my father came last night. 

83
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,410
 I'll go visit him. 

84
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,501
 

85
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,210
"No experience necessary.

86
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,950
Elders are welcome"?

87
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,680
 I replaced the sauces 

88
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,650
that expired while you were gone.

89
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,330
Use them without worrying.

90
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,100
Okay, I will.

91
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,710
Thank you.

92
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,930
By the way, did Sang Cheol's
retirement ceremony go well?

93
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,110
We talked on the phone that night, Father.

94
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,030
I'll come with you when you go back, then.

95
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,580
Pardon?

96
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,080
At my brother's 90th birthday party,

97
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,670
they gave out red ginseng gift sets to guests.

98
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,450
I thought it'd be a perfect gift for Sang Cheol.

99
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,540
So, I brought it with me.

100
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,740
He stepped out. He's not home, Father.

101
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,280
Really?

102
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,490
- Tomorrow, then.
- He's going out tomorrow, too.

103
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,870
He has a lot of appointments backed up.

104
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,280
Meet him a few days later...

105
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,690
I mean, see him next week,

106
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,170
He's busy these days.

107
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,270
Is that so? Okay, then.

108
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,200
He even has a job lined up.

109
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,940
A lot of people must want to see him.

110
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,750
Yes, of course.

111
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,770
Hey, Ji Eun Oh.

112
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,210
Come.

113
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,470
You told Ji Hyeok, right? And you succeeded.

114
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,490
That's why you cried, right?

115
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,800
Look at your puffy eyes.

116
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,600
No, I got dumped.

117
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,560
What? Say that again.

118
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,390
Say what again? Didn't you predict that?

119
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,510
Am I a fortuneteller or the weather service?
I didn't predict it.

120
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,510
What is it? Is it going to rain today?

121
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,860
What brings you here before lunch, Director?

122
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,370
Well, I wanted to have a sandwich here today.

123
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,380
Why are you three standing together?

124
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,100
What is it, Sunbae?

125
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,290
I mean, what brings you here?

126
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,790
Why do you ask as if I'm not supposed to be here?

127
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,380
Eun Oh, bring me the bill for the second quarter.

128
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,510
I was going to sign it last time,
but you left angrily.

129
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,430
Did I?

130
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,690
Right. At the rice soup place, right?

131
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,760
- Sang Wu, hand me my ledger.
- Okay.

132
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,210
- Iced Americano, right?
- No.

133
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,270
I'll go out to lunch with Seong Jae.

134
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,460
- With me?
- Yes.

135
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,070
Thank you.

136
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,620
Eun Oh, the second quarter's
additional volunteer cost

137
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,740
will be covered by Jong Min.

138
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,670
Let me know when the money is deposited.

139
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,790
That's great. I was worried about it.

140
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,830
Come. Let's go.

141
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,270
I'll come again next time.

142
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,650
What's with this situation?

143
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,250
You lied to me, didn't you?

144
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,960
What do you mean?

145
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,460
Wait...

146
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,310
I mean...

147
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,180
did you really ask him out and

148
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,730
did he really reject you?

149
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,260
You're acting like it was nothing.

150
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,080
Because it was nothing.

151
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,480
It was nothing?
I thought you got dumped yesterday.

152
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,620
Yes.

153
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,950
Even after seeing him after he dumped you?

154
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,110
Yes.

155
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,920
Are you sure you got dumped?

156
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,520
I said I liked him.

157
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,110
I asked him out. But he said he doesn't like me

158
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,310
and won't go out with me.

159
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,760
So, I definitely got dumped.

160
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,630
That's even weirder.

161
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,140
Are you saying you moved on overnight?

162
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,580
You know he doesn't beat around bushes.

163
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,040
I'm quick to understand, too.

164
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,590
That must be why.

165
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,600
Let's get to work, Su Jeong.

166
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,850
The fact that I broke up with Yeon Hee...

167
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,650
You told Eun Oh about it, didn't you?

168
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,340
Yes.

169
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,130
Hey, why would you tell her?

170
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,500
- Why you, of all people?
- What about me?

171
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,780
- You like Ji Eun Oh.
- If I like her,

172
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,050
am I not supposed to tell her that?

173
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,520
All I can do is be in love with her.

174
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,510
You knew I'd reject her.

175
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,100
You knew.

176
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,930
I don't know. How would I have known that?

177
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,760
- Hey, Park Seong Jae.
- Oh, that...

178
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,320
I said I fell for her six years ago,

179
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,700
but you were in the way.

180
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,780
When I asked if you were interested in her,

181
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,660
- are you referring to what you said?
- Is that the only time I said it?

182
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,870
I think I told you about three times.

183
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,820
Yes, exactly three times.

184
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,300
Whenever I approached her,

185
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,770
you always noticed it somehow and stopped me.

186
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,260
You told me to quit.

187
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,190
Because we aren't right for her.

188
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,280
That I shouldn't be with her,
and you aren't interested.

189
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,400
We're sidetracking, Seong Jae.

190
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,740
Why should I always listen to you?

191
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,860
And why do you always shut things
down as if that's given?

192
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,260
Why did you listen to me, then?

193
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,060
- Because it came from you.
- No.

194
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,460
Because I was right.

195
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,210
You were convinced and agreed.

196
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,510
You know all that.

197
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,050
I don't get why you told her about my breakup.

198
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,400
I promised Eun Oh.

199
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,870
- What?
- She asked me...

200
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,170
to tell her when you're not in a relationship.

201
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,090
But I had no reason to say no.

202
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,410
She wanted to confess her love
to someone she liked.

203
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,840
Don't act so proud that she confessed
her feelings for you. It's annoying.

204
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,710
Park Seong Jae,

205
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,570
are you yelling at me?

206
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,220
I'm the one who should be angry.

207
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,260
Wow. You never let me ask her out. You bastard.

208
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,040
Do you know how hard it is to be Daddy-Long-Legs?

209
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,710
You're the one who chose to be one.

210
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,800
Because I have to be that, at least.

211
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,740
If you like her so much,

212
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,750
why did you let her ask me out and get hurt?

213
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,530
You're the one who hurt her, you bastard.

214
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,160
Stop being unreasonable.

215
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,420
Eun Oh is like Su Bin to me.

216
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,380
Have I given her hope? Have I led her on?

217
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,900
You're impressive, Lee Ji Hyeok.

218
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,100
Is that why you rejected her so coldly?

219
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,500
Not giving her any hope is what's best for her.

220
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,390
You were so cold to her, to give her no hope.

221
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,140
Is that why you treated her like that earlier?

222
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,940
As if nothing happened?

223
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,520
Just like that?

224
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,490
You rejected her.

225
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,900
How could you see her as if nothing had happened?

226
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,770
Should I act like I'm bothered when I'm fine?

227
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,550
Why are you fine?

228
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,130
How could you be totally fine?

229
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,470
Because one is supposed to handle their emotions.

230
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,150
I rejected her unwanted love confession.

231
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,070
Should I help her move on, too?

232
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,610
What's with you, Park Seong Jae?

233
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,430
Eun Oh and I are a junior and a senior.

234
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,220
Geez, you're so stubborn.

235
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,190
Have a hot dog.

236
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,890
It's okay.

237
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,140
Just answer your phone.

238
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,780
Seriously.

239
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,510
Hey, the hotdog...

240
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,601
 

241
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,160
Hello?

242
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,290
Help?

243
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,160
What's it for?

244
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,840
- Please take your card.
- Okay.

245
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,490
Did you forget anything?

246
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,080
- Did I?
- The stamp card.

247
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,160
I think today's purchase will let you fill it up.

248
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,560
Oh, I forgot.

249
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,460
You have a great memory, Manager.

250
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,950
It's because you're our regular.

251
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,870
I'll get you another one.

252
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,280
Use your reward next time.

253
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,190
Okay. Thank you.

254
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,760
Hey, shake your head three times.

255
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,230
- Shake my head?
- That thing babies do.

256
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,100
I need to check if you're sane. Do it now.

257
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,700
- Here, here, here.
- How about me?

258
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,850
Who am I? Tell me what year,
month, and date today is.

259
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,170
I'm also curious...

260
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,780
to hear her answer.

261
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,240
See? You're acting very strange now.

262
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,080
Are you okay?

263
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,450
Everyone knows about it. How embarrassing.

264
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,400
You must need something.

265
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,500
Alcohol, someone to chat with...

266
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,800
I don't need anything.

267
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,040
But I'm a bit curious.

268
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,190
Didn't Ji Hyeok tell you?

269
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,870
He doesn't want to go out with me.

270
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,320
He has no interest. At all.

271
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,690
But I'm okay.

272
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,250
I can't believe I'm okay, too.

273
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,090
Really?

274
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,280
I suppose so.

275
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,600
Right, I forgot to sweep outside.

276
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,930
This doesn't suit you, Eun Oh.

277
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,800
What do you mean?

278
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,490
You say you're fine when you can't be fine.

279
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,560
It's not like you.

280
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,130
Call me if you need to chat.

281
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,920
Anytime.

282
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,470
I'm really okay, though.

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,640
 Did he mean our styles aren't compatible? 

284
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,790
Does he mean I'm not stylish enough for him?

285
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,010
Is that it?

286
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,930
Because I'm not sexy at all?

287
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,050
That can't be. Lee Ji Hyeok...

288
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,980
isn't like that.

289
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,610
Su Jeong,

290
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,730
what does he mean that we aren't compatible?

291
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,990
Can't hear you.

292
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,210
What kind of woman...

293
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,420
is compatible with him?

294
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,170
You're crazy.

295
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,510
What's with your outfit?

296
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,940
It's the look of someone
who ran away from a blind date.

297
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,420
Blind date?

298
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,890
You know...

299
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,340
that everyone knows about him and me,

300
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,210
so I can't marry anyone upper-class.

301
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,080
There's someone
who barely meets my dad's criteria.

302
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,540
If I met him today,

303
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,250
I'd probably be dragged to the
wedding venue next week.

304
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,940
I understand you're in a difficult situation,

305
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,380
but what do you need my help for?

306
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,510
I said I started dating someone.

307
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,240
By chance...

308
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,940
Someone is probably photographing us right now.

309
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,800
Is that why you told me to sit
with my back against the entrance?

310
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,080
Can you avoid it by just avoiding today?

311
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,930
I'll hire someone to act as my boyfriend.

312
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,190
Hello.

313
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm Lee Su Bin.

314
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,240
I'm...

315
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,701
 

316
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,060
I'm this kind of person.

317
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,340
Your name is "This kind of person"?

318
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,610
Is that a MZ style joke?

319
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,230
Yes.

320
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,020
Gosh, Su Ho. My gosh.

321
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,300
- Long time no see, Sang Cheol.
- Yes, yes.

322
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,800
- You've been well, right?
- Yes. Have a seat.

323
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,680
I'm so materialistic.

324
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,300
I'm obsessed with love,

325
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,970
but I don't want to lose what
my dad's status could offer.

326
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,160
You lost love.

327
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,890
You can't lose your status, too.

328
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,730
That's what makes me materialistic.

329
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,860
Is anyone not materialistic in this world?

330
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,860
Whether it's immediate or in a distant future,

331
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,880
everyone is living for their benefit.

332
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,330
And that's normal.

333
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,620
You're comforting me greatly.

334
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,440
Unless you'd never marry,

335
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,070
consider marrying someone your father wants.

336
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,040
You said Seo Jae Wuk left for Australia.

337
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,700
I don't wait for him anymore.

338
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,150
- A solution?
- Yes.

339
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,390
You got a job in the same industry
as soon as you retired.

340
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,910
Everyone said you must know of a solution.

341
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,970
You're forcing me to be honest.

342
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,840
It's my wife's family's company.

343
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,610
My father-in-law's cousin is the CEO.

344
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,930
Pardon?

345
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,690
My father-in-law practically begged him
to hire me.

346
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,370
Staying in the same industry,
even with a connection?

347
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,490
It's too difficult.

348
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,430
Your experience, skills, and network

349
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,150
mean nothing.

350
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,010
You know this, and that's
why you're here to see me.

351
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,730
Y-Yes.

352
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,980
Whether you have a connection or not,

353
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,440
reentering the industry itself is hard.

354
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,140
Just give up and...

355
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,430
find a job wherever you can.

356
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,540
But I need to keep doing the same thing.

357
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,380
I can't do something completely different.

358
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,180
Yes. You'll need time, too.

359
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,810
 That's when I realized... 

360
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,150
that nothing is more fun than making money.

361
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,070
It's so thrilling.

362
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,120
I hit jackpots one month after another.

363
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,460
Money just kept rolling in.

364
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,070
You think you have a high market value, right?

365
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,190
Market value?

366
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,570
You're young.

367
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,670
Although you aren't that young.

368
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,340
You have a decent...

369
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,200
face and body.

370
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,530
You think you meet every man's criteria, right?

371
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,570
That's why you're jobless, but confident.

372
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,810
You're totally mistaken.

373
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:23,100
Or was someone else supposed to be here?

374
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,180
You're a YouTuber. If you can't
make money regularly,

375
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,300
you're basically jobless.

376
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,140
It depends on how you think.
I'm still establishing myself.

377
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,850
What do you think...

378
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,780
of me, Su Bin?

379
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,630
You make good money. You definitely do.

380
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,840
Since you make good money,

381
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,640
you must think you meet
all the gold diggers' criteria.

382
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,860
That's not true.

383
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,790
You know...

384
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,840
if I just get a hair transplant,

385
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,480
I don't lack in any way.

386
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,950
- Why didn't you, then?
- Because I'm busy.

387
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,940
- Busy making money.
- I see.

388
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,740
What's this?

389
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,470
You get wedding invitations made?

390
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,750
Do people propose like this these days?

391
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,620
I should've done this.

392
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,490
Look at it, Oppa.

393
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,480
Everyone!

394
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,350
I'm finally getting married.

395
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,730
- Oppa.
- The bride, Jin Hong Mi!

396
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,370
The groom, Seong...

397
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,534
 

398
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,290
Seong Jae Ho?

399
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,310
W-What's this?

400
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,920
It's an invitation to my wedding.

401
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,960
Invitation to your wedding?

402
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,680
You're getting married? With someone else, not me?

403
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,490
I've been telling you that I won't marry you.

404
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,380
You're the one who didn't listen.

405
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,540
You're blaming me, right?

406
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,790
To a certain extend.

407
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,960
Hey,

408
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,380
we took a trip to the Philippines
for four days last month.

409
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,870
You were preparing for a wedding then?

410
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,170
You were dating someone else while dating me?

411
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,540
If you didn't tell me
to choose from three options,

412
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,810
I would've dated you until the day
before the wedding.

413
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,210
You're healthy, innocent,

414
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,610
and very handsome,

415
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,130
but I didn't like your background.

416
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,770
Hated it.

417
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,260
Don't even think about coming to my work.

418
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,740
I quit my job.

419
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,300
Don't come to the wedding, either.

420
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,440
Only those confirmed can enter.

421
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,040
So, this is what surreal means.

422
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,740
Enjoy the dessert and leave.

423
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,610
It's been fun.

424
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,930
Hong Mi. Hong Mi.

425
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,810
It'd be hard to forget being in your arms.

426
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,280
Even so, you can't force me, Oppa!

427
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,070
- Hey, Jin Hong Mi!
- Hong Mi.

428
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,740
Date violence is considered
a serious crime these days.

429
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,150
You believed whatever you wanted

430
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,860
and you loved me however you wanted to. Right?

431
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,620
So, you loved me all you want

432
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,220
and I received that love.
Thus, we won't have regrets.

433
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,180
You're so damn eloquent.

434
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,290
- Makes me feel shittier.
- You won't cling to me, right?

435
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,590
I won't.

436
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,740
- It'd be-
- Your loss to cling to a bitch like me.

437
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,590
Oppa, I'm a bitch.

438
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,930
I've been like this from the beginning.

439
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,434
 

440
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:51,033
 

441
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,830
I'll go home now.

442
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,120
Take care.

443
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,100
 Try to work until 10, starting this week. 

444
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,440
 Artists pull all-nighters before their solo shows. 

445
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,290
 You'd be ready for an interview 

446
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:27,580
 even if a reporter showed up at the studio, okay? 

447
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,450
 Isn't Yeong Ra working too hard? 

448
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,520
Tell her to eat with us at home
three or four times a week.

449
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,900
She said she can't.

450
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,340
She wants to.

451
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,950
The artist wants to focus.

452
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,770
Honey, we're non-artists.

453
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,740
Neither of our sides has artist DNA.

454
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,460
How did she end up with it?

455
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:10,410
By the way, that stalker who follows Yeong Ra...

456
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,490
Can't you catch him quickly?

457
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,370
I can't sleep because I'm anxious.

458
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,450
I told you not to worry.

459
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,070
Mr. Jeong was in special forces.

460
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,720
He leaves her a flower every day.

461
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,010
There's no point in catching
someone who leaves flowers.

462
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,100
He'd be released if he were not
charged with anything serious.

463
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,620
Just trust Mr. Jeong.

464
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,790
After her show,

465
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,100
we should get her married this year to feel safe.

466
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,200
Seong Jae needs to marry first.

467
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,080
Yeong Ra is still young.

468
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,610
I'm home.

469
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,450
Hey. You must be tired.

470
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,390
How about dinner? Did you eat something?

471
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,570
Yes, I ate plenty.

472
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,680
- I'll let you rest. I'll go upstairs.
- Come sit down.

473
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,210
He's back at almost 11.

474
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,270
Nag him later. Let him rest.

475
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,070
Have a seat.

476
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,170
When are you planning to get married?

477
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,190
I have no one to marry yet.

478
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,800
If you don't have anyone at 33,
you should find one.

479
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,460
Start going on blind dates.

480
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,510
I want to marry someone...

481
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,710
I dated a long time and know well.

482
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,710
A long time?

483
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,560
How long do you need to date to know someone well?

484
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,520
Time doesn't let you understand someone fully.

485
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,620
Don't sound so immature.

486
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,550
Anyway, I want to marry someone I meet naturally.

487
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,630
If I do marry.

488
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:44,390
Gosh, Seong Jae. What do you mean, "if you marry"?

489
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,750
Do you mean you might not?

490
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,080
Gosh, that's not good.

491
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,010
That's not what I meant, Mother.

492
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,070
I should marry.

493
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,730
I will. Don't worry.

494
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,220
I brought some work home.

495
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,870
How suspicious.

496
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,330
What's suspicious, exactly?

497
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,620
He hasn't met anyone
because he has high standards.

498
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
Geez. Crazy bastard.

499
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,860
Why order wine
when the last bus was about to leave?

500
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:31,300
 

501
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,490
What made you call so late, Manager?

502
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,540
 Mr. Ma doesn't want to see you anymore. 

503
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,860
He called this late to tell you that?

504
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,820
 He called while I was sleeping. 

505
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,110
 Anyway, I let you know. 

506
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,870
You've got to be kidding.

507
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:54,634
 

508
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,610
Geez, I lost seven subscribers.

509
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,970
 Your channel doesn't even
get you a million a month. 

510
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,760
 You think of that as a job? 

511
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,040
Just wait and see. I'll end up
with a million subscribers.

512
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,940
Just wait and see.

513
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,480
 There will be an additional charge after the beep. 

514
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,790
Oh Jae Jin,

515
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,460
whether you're on your way or not,

516
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,050
don't you know you have to call in
if it's past commute time?

517
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:26,570
Is that why you haven't called
when you're 50 minutes late?

518
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,970
It's 47 minutes, not 50.

519
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,240
Hey, Oh Jae Jin!

520
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,930
- Hello, Vice President.
- Hello.

521
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:45,270
Director, what brings you here with Jae Jin?

522
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,920
He's my successor.

523
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,190
Say hello. This is Director Oh Jae Jin.

524
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,640
He's my one and only son.

525
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,440
Because I wanted him to learn the business,

526
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,310
I let him work as an intern and a staff member.

527
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,660
I hope you understand.

528
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,190
I'm Oh Jae Jin.

529
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,410
W-Well...

530
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,250
I didn't even get a personnel notice.

531
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,840
It's probably up on the intranet now.

532
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,160
The new director wanted to
let his former team know first quietly.

533
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,970
That's why we came here first.

534
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,190
Who'll train this guy?

535
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,790
Who'll train him?

536
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,140
I will.

537
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,300
I will, but Jae Jin,

538
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,460
if you keep doing this, people will
think you're a nepotism hire.

539
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,690
I told you several times.

540
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,790
You can make mistakes twice,
but repeating three times

541
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,650
means you reached your limit.

542
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,150
How much longer should I tolerate you?

543
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,501
It won't take long.

544
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,033
 

545
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,870
I learned a lot over the last
six months, thanks to you.

546
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,150
We'll leave you to it. Let's go.

547
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,760
Let's go.

548
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,150
Team Leader,

549
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,670
I'll take a day off today.

550
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,650
Okay, okay.

551
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,530
Deputy Lee.

552
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,000
I thought I should talk to you privately.

553
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,850
Because you were my supervisor.

554
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,840
You tried hard to teach me.

555
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,730
By the way, Deputy Lee,

556
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,850
why did you pity me?

557
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,820
I was dying to tell you.

558
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,760
Why did you tolerate me?

559
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,000
I made many mistakes.

560
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,270
You should've scolded me.
Why did you console me instead?

561
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,280
Because I didn't think

562
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,340
you were making mistakes on purpose.

563
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,770
Just a moment.

564
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,250
I'll let you know when it's ready.

565
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,270
It's Ji Hyeok...

566
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,860
- Give me a bottle of sparkling water.
- Huh?

567
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,180
Okay.

568
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,934
 

569
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,290
Could you tell Eun Oh that
I need to use the printer?

570
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,133
You can just use it. She's not here.

571
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,767
 

572
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,690
He left, Eun Oh.

573
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,080
You hid because of Ji Hyeok, right?

574
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,750
Why did you hide?

575
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,020
I don't know, either.

576
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,500
Why did I hide?

577
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,670
That was unlike me.

578
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,700
Father.

579
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,510
W-Why are you back so early? Are you sick?

580
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,900
No. I was told you were home.

581
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,790
What's that, by the way?

582
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,090
It's nothing.

583
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,160
You taped ripped wrapping paper.

584
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,080
Where are you going, carrying that?

585
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,150
There's someone I need to see.

586
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,330
- Go inside.
- But still. You can't give anyone that.

587
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,360
Let's go inside. Let me re-wrap it for you.

588
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,790
I don't have the time now.

589
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,020
But still-

590
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,960
I can just give it to him like this.

591
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,620
Why?

592
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,390
Because you're giving it back to him?

593
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:47,480
You're meeting CEO Choi of Seongil Textile, right?

594
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,240
Don't go, Father.

595
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,580
Did you know?

596
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,540
I happened to find out.

597
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,570
- Let's talk later.
- Don't take that, though.

598
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,330
You can just return the money.

599
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,620
Taping back the ripped wrapping paper

600
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,630
won't restore your damaged self-esteem.

601
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,690
It only makes you smaller.

602
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,360
- What did you say just now?
- Well...

603
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,260
- I didn't mean it like that, Father.
- Don't act like you know.

604
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,930
You know nothing.

605
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,440
I'll go. I'll return it.

606
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,140
Tell me what you want to say.

607
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,250
I'll tell them exactly that.

608
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,850
I can't make you do this.

609
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,610
Father!

610
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,380
Father...

611
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,850
Seriously, Father...

612
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,580
How could he?

613
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,100
 You're meeting CEO Choi of Seongil Textile, right? 

614
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,900
 Don't go, Father. 

615
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,310
 Taping back the ripped wrapping paper 

616
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,210
 won't restore your damaged self-esteem. 

617
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,320
 It only makes you smaller. 

618
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,150
This was a good deal.

619
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:38,120
Da Jeong, he looks a lot like Ji Hyeok.

620
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,240
It's him.

621
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,860
He should be at work at this hour.

622
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,230
Ji Hyeok.

623
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,960
Ji Hyeok.

624
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,290
Gosh.

625
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,430
What are you doing here at this hour?

626
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,410
Why were you at the pharmacy?

627
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,760
Well, I have a bit of a headache.

628
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,200
Why do you have a headache?

629
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,120
Did you leave work early because of that?

630
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,170
Well, yes.

631
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,690
Do you have the flu?

632
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,200
You're breaking the rule, Mom.

633
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,590
Right. I can't check your temperature
by touching your forehead,

634
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,160
forcing you to lie down,

635
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,010
or make you soup for cold, right?

636
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,760
You're so smart, Mom.

637
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,040
Hey.

638
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,730
I was an elementary school teacher.

639
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,730
Let's stop talking and go home.

640
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,820
Let him lie down and rest.

641
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,220
Mother, we aren't making
cheonggukjang and marinated zucchini.

642
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,600
I'll make abalone rice.

643
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,110
It's our eldest's favorite.

644
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,490
Didn't you just shop?
Will you go back to the store?

645
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,340
My babies' favorite ingredients are

646
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,480
always ready in the freezer.

647
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,050
Hand me those.

648
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,190
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

649
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,700
The apples and envelope were untouched.

650
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,550
Feel free to check.

651
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,500
It's okay.

652
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,740
I'm done with you, then.
Let me talk to your father.

653
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,990
I know visitation is allowed.

654
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,550
Did you just talk down to me?

655
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,640
If I were an employee at that company,

656
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,710
I should be treating you as my boss,

657
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,810
but you're nothing more or less than

658
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,690
my old friend, Mr. Choi's son.

659
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,180
Move.

660
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,140
Unless you want to make a scene and look bad.

661
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,760
Skip the unnecessary comments.

662
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,970
You skip them, you bastard.

663
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,580
You've worked your body too hard.

664
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,560
I was aware that you worked too hard.

665
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,960
I'm sorry.

666
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,710
No, no.

667
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,010
This world is beyond our control.

668
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,640
We've experienced that many times.

669
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:22,730
Let's hold each other's hands.

670
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:44,010
Hang in there, Mr. Choi.

671
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:02,430
I could've waited for Father to come home.

672
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,850
You don't know when he'd be back.

673
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,230
He's unpredictable.

674
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,140
He's been unruly lately.

675
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,210
Help yourself.

676
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:15,810
I'll eat with my son.

677
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,120
Wait, Grand-

678
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,590
Eating with her son brings her joy.

679
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,690
Seeing my son eat brings me joy.

680
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,620
What have you been up to lately?

681
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,170
I'm the same as usual.

682
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,250
My today was like yesterday.

683
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,920
And my tomorrow will be like today.

684
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,160
Do you exercise?

685
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,420
Did you finish the vitamin D I got you last time?

686
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,760
I have some left.

687
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,540
Gosh. You've been skipping it. I told you not to.

688
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,910
Mom, you need to take care of yourself.

689
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,860
You worked too hard
caring for Grandpa and Grandma.

690
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,080
My life isn't considered so bad.

691
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,880
Since my husband is so handsome and dependable,

692
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,880
all three of my kids are good-looking.

693
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,420
Especially, my eldest is so dependable.

694
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,980
Do you mean that?

695
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,080
Of course.

696
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,870
You shouldn't find me dependable.

697
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,580
You should find Father dependable.

698
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,410
Of course, I find him dependable.

699
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,430
He's my other half.

700
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,860
You must...

701
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,310
have faith in Father.

702
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,310
What would I do if I didn't?

703
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,230
You went through a lot because of Grandpa.

704
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,830
My mom had dementia for over 10 years, too.

705
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,760
Your dad helped her without complaining.

706
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,810
Father...

707
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,910
sure married well.

708
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,730
- I'm home.
- Honey.

709
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:57,970
- Yes.
- We're...

710
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,820
having abalone rice today.

711
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,570
Is Ji Hyeok home?

712
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,850
He left early because of a bad headache.

713
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:07,560
I saw him getting a painkiller at a pharmacy.

714
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,870
Don't go upstairs. I told him to rest.

715
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,280
Okay.

716
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,310
Did he say anything else?

717
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,620
Of course, he did.

718
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,250
He worried about me.

719
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,790
He told me to take the vitamins.

720
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,590
Oh, I see.

721
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,767
 

722
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,440
Right, Honey,

723
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,750
what did he say when you returned that stuff?

724
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,490
That son was rude to you, wasn't he?

725
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,250
You should've hit him in the head.

726
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,300
I told him off instead.

727
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,980
Did you?

728
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,690
Why didn't you hit him?

729
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,340
You should've flicked his head or something.

730
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,580
I should've come with you to do it for you.

731
00:46:58,934 --> 00:47:00,060
 

732
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,820
Good job, Honey.

733
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,520
You did the right thing.

734
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,540
At first, I thought we should re-wrap the box.

735
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,800
But no.

736
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,030
It's perfect to return it as it was.

737
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,267
 

738
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,767
 

739
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,890
 Yes, Director Yu of Lincoln Construction
recommended it. 

740
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,467
Could you send me the construction plan?

741
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,567
 

742
00:47:52,534 --> 00:47:53,067
 

743
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,977
 Deputy Lee, come to my desk. 

744
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,000
I'll check and visit the site.

745
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,540
I can give you a recommendation afterward.

746
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,100
I don't know about others, but

747
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,420
I thought I should give it to you in person.

748
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,570
It's an invitation to my wedding.

749
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,970
It looks like it.

750
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,800
Also...

751
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,400
since you're so thorough,

752
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,230
I'll ask you to receive money gifts.

753
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,980
You can come a few hours early.

754
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,850
You don't have to give this to me.

755
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:44,934
 

756
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,620
Mr. Lee Ji Hyeok!

757
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:58,400
How dare you leave without transferring your duty?

758
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,150
There's someone who can do that for me.

759
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,250
His name is Oh Jae Jin.

760
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,800
He started as an intern and went full-time.

761
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,600
I'm sure he knows all the progress,
references, and methods,

762
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:15,250
I taught him repeatedly. He should
know unless he's a shithead.

763
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:36,133
 

764
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,600
Deputy Lee.

765
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,590
Lee Ji Hyeok,

766
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,770
rethink this just once.

767
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:51,960
You'll be a deputy elsewhere even if you leave.

768
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,640
I already submitted
a resignation letter, Team Leader.

769
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,820
I can help you with that.

770
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,910
You were all settled here.

771
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,980
And we're...

772
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,460
a special VIP team.

773
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,900
Thank you for caring.

774
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,600
Right?

775
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,800
Hey, we can only leap so far.

776
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,360
Be well.

777
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,640
Fine.

778
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,900
I would've quit if I didn't have a wife and a kid.

779
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,820
Your hands will wear out. Stop.

780
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,040
Why should I?

781
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,470
Flies will slide on this surface.

782
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,540
Is it finally kicking in?

783
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,390
You had PTSD yesterday

784
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,330
because of the shock, right?

785
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,360
No, I didn't.

786
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,030
But I guess that's possible.

787
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,980
No, no. I'm just cleaning.

788
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,960
Since the construction ended,

789
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,930
you should go on a trip for a few days.

790
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,760
I was gone a lot because of that.
I can't take a trip.

791
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,000
I need to manage the cafe.

792
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,830
Hello.

793
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,040
Beer, iced Americano, and tiramisu.

794
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,360
Sparkling water instead of beer.

795
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,360
There must be something going on.

796
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,970
Beer, iced Americano, and tiramisu, he said.

797
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,470
Huh?

798
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:52,970
That's his order when he has
something to think about.

799
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,720
You know him a little too well.

800
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,310
You're worried about him right now?

801
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,880
Check the website and see
if someone requested a quote.

802
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,150
I'll bring him his order.

803
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,800
No. I'll bring it to him.

804
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,030
As usual.

805
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,840
Would you be okay?

806
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,090
You hid when you saw him last time.

807
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,520
It was a mistake.

808
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,934
 

809
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,640
Sparkling water,

810
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,150
iced Americano,

811
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,520
and tiramisu.

812
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,860
And...

813
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,670
here are your card and receipt.

814
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,210
Thank you.

815
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,960
I'll clean the restroom.

816
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,550
How do I handle this intense situation?

817
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:27,640
Find me the earliest flight to São Paulo.

818
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:30,660
I don't care which travel company it is.

819
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,610
Anytime after today.

820
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:36,400
 Ji Hyeok, 

821
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,360
 shouldn't we provide living expenses? 

822
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,250
 I'm doing fine, of course. 

823
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:48,220
 I'm busy seeing people I haven't been able to see. 

824
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,930
 You want to turn me into a guy who gladly accepted 

825
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,450
 money for losing a job? 

826
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:57,730
 I'm so sorry. I made a huge mistake. 

827
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,650
I'm sorry.

828
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,050
I'll call you again later.

829
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,360
Hey, let's eat. It's almost 2 p.m.

830
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,820
I'm starving.

831
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,890
You're right. Go eat.

832
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,020
You're supposed to eat first today.

833
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,640
Didn't I eat earlier?

834
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,820
I think I ate something.

835
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,070
I gave you cookies as a snack.

836
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,240
That's why I wasn't hungry. Go eat.

837
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,100
Sunbae.

838
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:11,580
You've been here for three hours now.

839
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,240
- So?
- Did you have to be here for so long?

840
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,600
You had no particular reason to be here.

841
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,950
Do I have to come here for a particular reason?

842
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,580
Am I only allowed here
for a certain amount of time?

843
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:36,920
- Tell Ji Eun Oh to come.
- I won't. Talk to me.

844
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,120
You aren't her. I can't talk to you.

845
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,130
What I'm saying is-

846
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,960
Sorry, Sunbae.

847
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,900
You're too cruel.

848
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,940
Can't you see her suffering right now?

849
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,870
Stop being silly, Su Jeong.

850
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,970
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

851
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,480
Ji Eun Oh,

852
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,640
I make you feel uncomfortable by coming here, huh?

853
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,260
Yes.

854
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,640
Deal with it. Don't let it show.

855
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,040
I came here to relax.

856
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,870
To relax here.

857
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,250
This has been a place like that all this time.

858
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,430
And it will continue to be.

859
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,730
He's my enemy from now on.

860
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,950
 Let's play basketball. 

861
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,747
 

862
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,410
 Come to the usual spot. 

863
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,900
Right now?

864
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,430
I know you're flexible.

865
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,990
I quit my job.

866
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,630
Ji Hyeok!

867
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,640
Ji Hyeok!

868
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,110
Ji Hyeok.

869
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:27,810
You won't talk to me
at a park or another cafe, right?

870
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,210
No.

871
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,230
I'll talk to you here, then.

872
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,810
- Eun Oh.
- How am I not compatible with you?

873
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,920
Are we doing this again?

874
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,870
I'm not picking a fight.

875
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,870
I'm not asking you to reconsider.

876
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:52,550
No. I just need to understand.

877
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:54,860
Understand?

878
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,560
I just don't understand.

879
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,060
I don't get it.

880
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,350
I need to understand to resolve
the issue and learn the answer.

881
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,220
If I don't know the answer,
I can't move on from the question.

882
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,440
So, explain to me in detail.

883
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,890
About how I'm not compatible with you.

884
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:13,890
If I understand,
I'll go back to being your junior.

885
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,470
I don't want to lose you, either.

886
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,780
Because I liked you as a person first.

887
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,870
When people can't be direct,

888
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:44,500
they beat around the bush.

889
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,700
Didn't you notice?

890
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,920
Why are you doing that?

891
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,580
You've never done that before.

892
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,160
People usually...

893
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,500
find someone who's below
their standards incompatible with them.

894
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:06,150
- So, what do you mean-
- Stop acting childish.

895
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,820
Why do you tell me to reveal
my feelings? It's rude.

896
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,760
As I remember, I never gave you hope.

897
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,830
Do you remember me doing that?

898
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:26,940
I appreciated, liked, trusted, and cherished you.

899
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,100
As a person and a junior.

900
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,100
You know that, right?

901
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,080
Figure out the rest, then.

902
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,810
An adult...

903
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,370
needs to piece things together sometimes.

904
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:46,090
Imagine, assess, and guess.

905
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,110
Try everything.

906
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,420
There will be an answer somewhere.

907
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:55,160
You refuse to tell me until the end.

908
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,380
- It doesn't seem so hard.
- That's your opinion.

909
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:01,370
Why? How?

910
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:03,470
That's not the point.

911
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,490
The fact that...

912
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:08,840
I don't think of you as a romantic interest.
That's the point.

913
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,330
I could never be your romantic partner.

914
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,720
And I have no interest in it. That's the point.

915
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,540
Ji Eun Oh,

916
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:24,600
I guess...

917
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,730
I treated you too well.

918
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:32,050
Because you're pressuring me as if you're entitled.

919
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,950
Hurry up and come to your senses.

920
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,400
Don't make me feel uncomfortable like this again.

921
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:43,640
If you can't hide your discomfort,

922
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,290
quit your job as a manager at our cafe.

923
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:50,680
You know the reason why the space was created

924
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,060
better than anyone else.

925
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,150
Answer me.

926
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:58,810
Okay.

927
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,480
Let's stop now.

928
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,430
I hear you, Sunbae.

929
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,940
No one knows...

930
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,610
how I feel.

931
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,960
 These kids don't know what cruel means. 

932
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,730
 My father doesn't understand. 

933
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:21,810
 No one understands... 

934
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,350
Me.

935
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,210
About how I feel.

936
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:33,540
What am I to do?

937
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,650
What am I supposed to do?

938
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,760
Why do you talk to yourself so loudly?

939
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,280
Yes, I'm glad you quit.

940
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,920
Of course, you had to quit.

941
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,750
What a crazy...

942
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,130
You can't work for someone like that.

943
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,330
How was that supposed to work?

944
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:13,330
Geez, what a crazy bastard. How annoying.

945
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,120
I know, right?

946
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:17,980
Gosh, so annoying.

947
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,540
Geez, I'm angry.

948
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,600
I feel comforted.

949
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,090
Ji Hyeok,

950
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:33,680
you should just take a long trip.

951
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,830
Since office workers can't take long trips,

952
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:38,800
they do it while preparing to switch jobs.

953
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:42,620
Trip?

954
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,250
I want to leave.

955
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:48,480
You wanted to go to South America
when I mentioned it.

956
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,470
I can't afford to go on a trip.

957
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,790
I'll apply for jobs immediately.

958
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,930
Hey, why? You should rest a bit.

959
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:02,350
My father is no longer...

960
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,010
starting a new job.

961
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,000
W-What?

962
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,050
Seong Jae, life is...

963
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,050
so harsh.

964
01:04:18,834 --> 01:04:23,100
 

965
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:35,033
 

966
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:50,100
 Hey, we can only leap so far. 

967
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:09,601
 

968
01:05:11,901 --> 01:05:12,834
 

969
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,100
 

970
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,400
 

971
01:05:27,334 --> 01:05:29,701
 

972
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:38,160
What's this about?

973
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,400
Did you want to exercise as soon as you quit?

974
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,290
This reminds me of...

975
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:48,510
when we did volunteer work at Edel Orphanage.

976
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:52,130
The rumor spread within an hour

977
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:54,060
of you submitting the resignation letter.

978
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,510
Cut to the chase.

979
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:57,340
Is there an issue with the building materials?

980
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,480
I thought we were done
with the Haneul Construction project.

981
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,170
That's not why I wanted to see you.

982
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,400
Aren't you thirsty?

983
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,630
Cut to the chase first.

984
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:11,040
Did you...

985
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,580
quit your job with a plan?

986
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:17,370
Did you make me come to ask that?

987
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:19,150
Answer me first.

988
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,420
Did you quit with a plan?

989
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,630
You're being too curious, unlike you.

990
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:27,680
I'm not just curious. I need to know.

991
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:31,080
You don't have a plan yet, right?

992
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,490
Oh Jae Jin was promoted a few days ago

993
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,900
and you quit.

994
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,240
I don't feel like figuring out
what you're trying to say.

995
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,750
I heard you were so cool when you quit.

996
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:45,800
Three female employees asked me
to introduce you to them.

997
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:52,140
Did you insist on seeing me today
because of a blind date?

998
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,850
Why would I arrange blind dates

999
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:57,180
when I'm going to propose to you?

1000
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,880
You heard me right.

1001
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,090
What...

1002
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,970
What are you trying to get at?

1003
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:14,850
Marry me, Ji Hyeok.

1004
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:33,480
 ♫ Shining as brightly as the stars ♫ 

1005
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,000
 ♫ I hope my feelings reach you ♫ 

1006
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:47,500
 ♫ I'll take one step at a time
and always wait for you ♫ 

1007
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:52,390
 ♫ Under the quiet night sky ♫ 

1008
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:57,210
 ♫ Looking at the moon shining brightly ♫ 

1009
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:08,300
 ♫ I take a step forward slowly,
hoping to reach you ♫ 

1010
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,350
 What about your situation? 

1011
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,240
 When did I ask you to worry about living expenses? 

1012
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,400
 I'm the father. I'm the breadwinner. 

1013
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,950
 Because of your pride, 

1014
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:21,270
 should Grandma, Mom, I,
and even you pretend to be happy? 

1015
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:22,270
 She wants to marry you? 

1016
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:24,680
 I don't care if she's crazy or not. 

1017
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,300
 But come to your senses, Ji Hyeok. 

1018
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,240
 It's you, the lady from the subway. 

1019
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,560
 Could we talk briefly right now? 

1020
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,040
 When you date from now on, 

1021
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,300
 meet someone nice, not someone you like. 

1022
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:39,180
 Liking someone is based
on feelings. Those feelings... 

1023
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,080
 don't have much power.
