1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,940
 

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,060
What are you doing, Ji Eun Oh?

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,600
What are you doing?

4
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,900
You're the one who picked up my stuff.

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,300
I put it back because it's not mine.

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,500
How cold.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,800
You shouldn't have looked at it.
Or you should've put it on the table if you did.

8
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,380
I'm sorry for looking at it
without your permission.

9
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,010
Is that why you tried to go out and come back in?

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,510
Does it feel good to act like you know it all?

11
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,010
I need to open the cafe. Tidy up, please.

12
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,070
Hold on.

13
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,940
Why did you come here, by the way?

14
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,150
I thought you were going to the job site in Mapo.

15
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,460
There's no construction today.

16
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,540
Why? Was there an accident?

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,590
The facility director is attending
his mother-in-law's funeral today.

18
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,010
We'll start tomorrow, along
with the electrical work.

19
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,030
Can you do that?

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,940
Where are you installing the utilities?

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,980
You sure have a lot to say for someone
who just woke up at a cafe.

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,270
Geez. I was awake until seven.
When did I fall asleep?

23
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,870
You shouldn't have let her
see you working in the cafe.

24
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,890
You even slept in. Good job.

25
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,390
There you are.

26
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,170
What's this noise, by the way?

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,520
An unbelievable noise.

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,690
Sunbaenim, is it a special day today?

29
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,980
I'm pitching for investment today.

30
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,160
Thank you for wishing me good luck.

31
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,580
Was he always so outgoing?

32
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,230
He always had that side.

33
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,790
The bathroom.

34
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,880
Wow. There isn't even a drop of water.

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,270
You're right.

36
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,180
We thought he showers at a spa.

37
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,020
Has he been this frugal all along?

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,450
This is why our water bill increased.

39
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,890
But you were kind of surprised just now, right?

40
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,680
Yes.

41
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,970
I think I've been mistaken about some things, too.

42
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,540
Like what?

43
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,820
As you can see, from 2020 to 2025,

44
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,290
DIY interior design has been
growing in popularity.

45
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,470
There are two reasons it became popular.

46
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,900
Money and uniqueness.

47
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,730
It's inexpensive compared
to turnkey interior design.

48
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,950
Instead, you have to be in charge of everything.

49
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,890
You can decorate your home the way
you like without anyone interfering.

50
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,850
But there's an issue.

51
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,830
DIY interior design requires educating yourself.

52
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,870
No matter how much you learn,

53
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,260
it's hard to get professional quality.

54
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,820
Here are the examples.

55
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,640
But the millennials and Gen Z designers

56
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,630
who want both income and unique aesthetics

57
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,200
are losing jobs due to the slow market.

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,980
A new job called a coordinator that
manages DIY projects

59
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,020
should be appealing to them.

60
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,090
Custom Homes connect these two groups of people

61
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,260
and let them create quality DIY homes. It lets you...

62
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,240
customize your home.

63
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,460
It's the first-ever matching platform.

64
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,760
 

65
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,280
Yes.

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,940
Did you find it?

67
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,950
Thank you.

68
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,510
You don't have to know that.

69
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,640
Really?

70
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,390
When is that?

71
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,880
Where are you going?

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,400
The client of home No. 1
suddenly wants to meet up.

73
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,650
By the way, it doesn't look like
it went well with Ji Hyeok.

74
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,090
It's hard to achieve success without experience.

75
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,930
 

76
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,290
Why are there requests for a turnkey service?

77
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,190
Why do I keep getting them?

78
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,320
How come you always come together?

79
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,790
Yeong Ra refuses to listen.

80
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,620
I tell her to go with friends,
but she wants to care for me.

81
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,160
Yeonghyo Construction's wife was

82
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,170
jealous to hear about you.

83
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,760
Oh, they don't have a daughter, right?

84
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,060
They only have three sons, right?

85
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,110
The key is inside.

86
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,260
I'm leaving.

87
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,100
Drive her safely.

88
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,510
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,540
Open the back door.

90
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,220
Yeong Ra, why don't you have
lunch with your mother?

91
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,730
Because I brought a boxed lunch.

92
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,900
It's 12:10 right now.

93
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,630
Shouldn't a mother and daughter get
lunch after getting a massage together?

94
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,530
Do you have to eat your boxed lunch?

95
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,980
Yes.

96
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,280
Why?

97
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,940
Because I brought it.

98
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,050
Yes, that, too.

99
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,790
Why do you always pack two meals every day?

100
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,210
If you're trying to avoid the stalker,

101
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,600
I'll escort you.

102
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,570
Let's eat lunch outside.

103
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,360
It's okay. I've always had boxed meals.

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,960
Always? Every day?

105
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,490
Yes.

106
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,240
It's for my health.

107
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,750
Do you have some kind of condition?

108
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,410
No. I'm very healthy.

109
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,230
That's even weirder.

110
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,210
You care for your health so much that
you don't even eat out with your mom?

111
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,170
I guess Mom had a lunch appointment.

112
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,330
You don't know for sure?

113
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,600
She's not obligated to tell me everything.

114
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,250
Do you bring boxed meals
when you meet friends, too?

115
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,750
You must eat out on those occasions.

116
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,620
I don't meet up with friends.

117
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,870
Why not? Don't you have any?

118
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,990
I no longer do.

119
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,010
You mean, friends? How's that possible?

120
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,440
It's not like they're absolutely necessary.

121
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,430
You said people have different
definitions of friends.

122
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,770
You meant you didn't have any?

123
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,540
You only do unproductive things with friends.

124
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,420
You just eat and have silly talks.

125
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,490
Park Yeong Ra, have you ever been to a club?

126
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,870
Why would I go there?

127
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,360
Have you been to a theme park with friends, then?

128
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,880
I've been to it with my parents.

129
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,950
What about the Jara Island Festival?

130
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,390
Why should I go there?

131
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,110
How about a concert or a musical?

132
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,480
I go with my mom.

133
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,360
Have you been to the Yeoui-do Fireworks Festival?

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,640
How about the Hangang Park?
Have you been to Seongsu-dong?

135
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,220
Have you played with a claw machine?
How about coin karaoke?

136
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,800
Have you taken photos
in a photo booth with friends?

137
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,700
Have you been to Hongdae?
You've been to an escape room, right?

138
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,520
How about a board game room?

139
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,800
I think I know your answer.

140
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,790
You haven't done any of those.

141
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,050
Wow. What kind of life is that?

142
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,650
What's the deal?

143
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,480
Sorry. I'm done asking questions.

144
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,580
I hear you picked a gallery for the solo show.

145
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,840
Yes. It's all thanks to you.

146
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,800
I just recommended a few galleries.

147
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,140
That gallery director doesn't let
anyone have a show there.

148
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,410
Well done.

149
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,230
It's for my daughter.

150
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,030
You must've wanted to see me today
about your daughter, too.

151
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,380
What is it?

152
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,830
The thing is,

153
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,400
here's the VIP list for Yeong Ra's solo show.

154
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,240
It's just my wish, ma'am.

155
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,750
I was hoping for you to look through it.

156
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,590
 
From the list,

157
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,230
I'd like your recommendation on people
who are interested in art.

158
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,150
You're really something, Ms. Ko.

159
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:47,480
Looks like these are the people you want to invite

160
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,130
and you're asking me to provide connections.

161
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,060
It's probably because I trust you.

162
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,120
You've always been a good talker.

163
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,280
Would it be possible, somehow?

164
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,030
 

165
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,910
What do I do?

166
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,010
I keep thinking about it every night.

167
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,520
I saw this photo of the kitchen 10 days ago,

168
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,180
but I was hesitant because it'd cost so much.

169
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,670
But I'll live in this apartment
for at least 10 years.

170
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,340
The kitchen is so important.

171
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,870
So, you want to change the counter,

172
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,260
and change the cabinet faces like this, right?

173
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,740
But that would cost a lot more.

174
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,200
You know they already started
producing kitchen furnishings, right?

175
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,920
I do.

176
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,310
But my husband said he'll divorce
me if I don't change it.

177
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,100
Pardon?

178
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,600
I kept saying, "I should've gone with this,
I should've" every single night.

179
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,730
He said he doesn't want to hear it for 10 years.

180
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,990
I tend to hold onto regrets.

181
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,020
I can do it if you're willing to pay for it.

182
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,410
But what about your move?

183
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,180
We can store our stuff longer.

184
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,750
We're staying with my parents. So, it's okay.

185
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,380
Okay. Got it.

186
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,090
Send me the sketch for the kitchen.

187
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,080
I'll try making a plan out of it.

188
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,920
Gosh. I feel terrible and grateful.

189
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,600
I thought cheap stuff would be fine
since it's still new.

190
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,550
But since I'll probably regret it for 10 years,

191
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,540
I thought I'd better change it.

192
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,850
Of course.

193
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,630
The kitchen is a very important space in the home.

194
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,460
 It's DIY, but the details are good. 

195
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,740
 Right, right? These are the photos
of our construction progress. 

196
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,810
 Our coordinator is incredible. 

197
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,850
 You got a good coordinator, 

198
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,490
 but that's how that company operates. 

199
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,620
 That's true. 

200
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,200
 The CEO is so great, too. 

201
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,500
 

202
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,120
Ji Eun Oh contributed a lot.

203
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,130
 I want you to be the coordinator
for my first client. 

204
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,100
 I'll pay you 20 million. 

205
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,590
 You'll pay me 20 million? 

206
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,780
 The result of your pitch will be
determined in a few days to a week. 

207
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,690
Angel Investment said they can
decide on the same day.

208
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,230
I can do it. I can do it. I can do it.

209
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,920
Instead of getting a loan with my car,

210
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,820
I'll pay her after getting the investment myself.

211
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,730
Who is it?

212
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,990
The home No. 1 has a bit of an issue.

213
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,270
Come in.

214
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,130
No. It's simple.

215
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,370
The client wants to change the
entire kitchen cabinetry.

216
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,210
Including the design and material.

217
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,590
That would affect the construction schedule.

218
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,430
It would take at least a week.

219
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,240
She's willing to pay for the old cabinets.

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,310
She can postpone the moving date, too.

221
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,260
Would you be okay with it?

222
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,800
Yes. I have old kitchen designs.

223
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,890
I just need to do a little more work.

224
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,370
That would add to the design fee, too.

225
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,260
I'll leave that up to you, CEO.

226
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,060
Okay.

227
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,680
A week?

228
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,370
Why are things going so well?

229
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,200
Welcome.

230
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,380
Hello. Where's Custom Homes' office?

231
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,490
- Here.
- Huh?

232
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,200
You know Hyeonmyeong Apartments, right?

233
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,900
You're working there right now.

234
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,470
We're the building representatives
of Buildings 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.

235
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,710
Oh, yes.

236
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,060
But the office is a bit small.

237
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,030
We do group meetings in the cafe.

238
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,630
Let's go out.

239
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,160
Haven't you heard of group purchases?

240
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,780
I have.

241
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,690
So, the ones who want to do DIY projects are...

242
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,140
There are 29 homes.

243
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,240
Only in Buildings 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.

244
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,510
We pay for the materials and labor, right?

245
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,170
We get to choose them, too, right?

246
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,110
You can buy the materials yourself.

247
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,430
We can only help with the order amount.

248
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,600
Since this is a group purchase,

249
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,440
you can give us a discount
for the coordinator fees, right?

250
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,540
About 30% off, maybe?

251
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,150
We can't do that.

252
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,090
Gosh, look. We're 29 homes in total.

253
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,220
You'll get a lot more clients if things go well.

254
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,770
Our buildings are 38 years old.

255
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,730
You can't think of the coordinators
as a commodity.

256
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,070
They're all interior design experts.

257
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,840
Can't you give us 20% off?

258
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,790
Not even 1%.

259
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,130
If you think that cost is a waste,
you can figure it out yourself.

260
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:37,050
There are many online DIY communities.
Do you need recommendations?

261
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,920
Group purchases are possible
because they're cheap.

262
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,370
Our buildings have 3,000 units.

263
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,950
Gosh. Let's forget it. Let's go. Let's go.

264
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,380
Why are you so difficult?

265
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,620
We're giving you 29 projects at your fingertips.

266
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,460
It's not that.

267
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,370
We're connecting you to overseers.

268
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,930
That's the same thing.

269
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,740
What's with those ladies?

270
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,200
Looks like Ji Hyeok is being bullied by them.

271
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,250
Probably not.

272
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,880
He doesn't get bullied so easily.

273
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,590
You're a young CEO, but so inflexible.

274
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,010
You're just starting out.

275
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,930
You should be offering us
a discount first for 29 homes.

276
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,940
I have rules I abide by.

277
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,550
Even if we all walk out?

278
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,780
Yes.

279
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,180
Forget it.

280
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,150
Give it to me.

281
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,280
You know...

282
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,920
we just need to show you what
we want like this, right?

283
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,190
Yes.

284
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,830
The coordinators will turn them
into construction plans.

285
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,090
When can you start, then?

286
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,300
Will you sign the contracts?

287
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

288
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,270
Thank you.

289
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,520
- Take care.
- Bye.

290
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,430
- One iced Americano.
- Okay.

291
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,440
What's group purchase, by the way?

292
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,240
Twenty-nine homes want to hire our coordinators.

293
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,040
Looks like the unstoppable Lee Ji Hyeok is back.

294
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,050
Where's Eun Oh? Did she go home?

295
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,140
She's cleaning the terrace.

296
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,500
Unbelievable. Seriously.

297
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,730
 

298
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,270
Sorry, Myeong Hui. I should've called you first.

299
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,890
They do?

300
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,110
Of course, I can. It's been a few months.

301
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,570
When would you like to meet, then?

302
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,770
If the two parallel conductors' electricity
flows in the same direction,

303
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,890
it creates a magnetic pull. If they flow
in opposite directions...

304
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,410
The man in the navy shirt.

305
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,140
Could you wake him up next to you?

306
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,680
Excuse me.

307
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,530
This is a very important part.

308
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm sorry. I didn't sleep well.

309
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,990
If they flow in opposite directions,
which means they're reciprocating conductors,

310
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,050
there will be resistance.

311
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,340
You must work, too.

312
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,010
Yes.

313
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:12,140
I'm sure there aren't many of us
who can afford to only study.

314
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,550
That's how we'll end up
getting neither done right.

315
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,070
Gosh, what a fool.

316
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,430
How dare you doze off?

317
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,130
You can't even handle this?

318
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,710
Yes, Mr. Lee Sang Cheol.

319
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,910
I knew you were pushing yourself too much.

320
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,470
I was going to study upstairs.

321
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,040
Upstairs?

322
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,190
The room with a desk.

323
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,020
What time is it?

324
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,540
Gosh. It's already one.

325
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,280
 Part-time job. Part-time job. 

326
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,050
What?

327
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,380
Who's looking for a part-timer at this hour?

328
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,506
 

329
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,260
A convenience store in Jaeha-dong?

330
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,930
It's not in this neighborhood.

331
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,180
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
That's perfect for me.

332
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,000
 

333
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,180
 

334
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,000
 Custom Homes passed our final assessment 

335
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,590
 and was chosen as an awardee. 

336
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,970
I did it. I got it.

337
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,810
I was given a chance, but I still need to present.

338
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,890
 

339
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,470
Hello.

340
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,520
For DIY interior design clients,

341
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,870
we provide a matching platform
to create high-quality homes.

342
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,400
I'm Lee Ji Hyeok, the CEO of Custom Homes.

343
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,740
You have four minutes to present
and five minutes to answer questions.

344
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,830
The timer will go off when your time is up.

345
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,230
Please start whenever you're ready.

346
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,610
Thank you.

347
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,060
When did you come up with this idea?

348
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,240
Does it matter when?

349
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,720
Even if I said it was three or five years ago,

350
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,050
there's no way to know if it's true.

351
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,580
I don't think time equals depth.

352
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,300
The reason is what's important.

353
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,000
What was the reason, then?

354
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,100
This idea came to me by chance.

355
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,990
I worked as a laborer in the countryside once.

356
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,110
I was asked for help by newlyweds
who faced an issue during construction.

357
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,110
That's the moment when everything started.

358
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,360
Whether it's for affordability or
uniqueness, many people

359
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,000
want to enjoy their home they designed themselves.

360
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,600
That gave me assurance that
I have infinite possibilities.

361
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,110
Ji Hyeok.

362
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,740
You must've been surprised.

363
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,820
I thought that was your intention.

364
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,200
I tried to be clever to invest in your business.

365
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,570
I could've done it secretly,

366
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,750
but you would've killed me if you found out later.

367
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,810
So?

368
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,170
I'll invest in Custom Homes.

369
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,460
Without discussing with your teammates?

370
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,310
Angel investments don't always require teams.

371
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,590
I know.

372
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,200
- We're good, then.
- No, we aren't.

373
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,780
I'll refuse your investment.

374
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,350
Please stop now.

375
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,430
Businesses need investment.

376
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,560
I've looked at your website and
what you've been doing.

377
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,860
It's worth investing in.
It won't take a fortune, either.

378
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,910
It's really okay, Seong Jae.

379
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,700
Besides, Double-S Startup agreed to invest.

380
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,870
And I told you. I won't get anyone's help.

381
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,410
Hey, man, why did you come here, then?

382
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,090
You even found an investor.

383
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,630
I kept my promise to make my pitch.

384
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,700
I heard the result when I was about to go in.

385
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,560
They just support businesses.
You can accept my investment, too.

386
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,500
The most you can get from them
is 100 or 200 million.

387
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,470
Since I got the investment from
Double-S Startup on my own,

388
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,920
I want to do this myself.

389
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,860
Aren't you being too proud?

390
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,170
A businessman shouldn't be like that.

391
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,820
Why not.

392
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,930
And thank you, Seong Jae.
I appreciate the gesture.

393
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,100
I'm not doing this because of Eun Oh.

394
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,300
Ji Hyeok, I even saw your website.

395
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,280
And I'm your friend.

396
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,000
And I can tell you're actually
trying to do something.

397
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,830
No. Even if you were just doing this for show,

398
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,280
I feel uneasy not doing anything.

399
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,300
Don't you understand how I feel?

400
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,100
I do. That's why I'll only appreciate the gesture.

401
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,000
But I don't want to betray my standards
in order to understand you.

402
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,990
Good for you, Lee Ji Hyeok.

403
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,060
Let's grab lunch. I'll buy you something tasty.

404
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,640
I already have a plan.

405
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,190
With whom?

406
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,800
Someone who needs my advice.

407
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm leaving.

408
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,830
Why did everything get so
mysterious while I was gone?

409
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,940
Why does she want to meet somewhere like this?

410
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,780
Couldn't she send me the address
of the restaurant?

411
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,580
You can't park here, okay?

412
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,220
What's this?

413
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,400
What?

414
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,030
Well...

415
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,250
I'm not used to that style.

416
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,640
I have somewhere to be after lunch.

417
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,140
Let's go, Oppa.

418
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,520
Hey, why do you suddenly lock arms?

419
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,170
What's wrong? You gave me a piggyback ride, too.

420
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,590
Locking arms isn't a big deal between us.

421
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,940
Su Bin, what's this?

422
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,330
Isn't it funny? The babies are quail eggs,
and the mom is a chicken egg.

423
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,780
You've never seen this, have you?

424
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,920
It's the first time.

425
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,630
Eat, Oppa.

426
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,260
No, you eat. I'll serve myself.

427
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,060
Whenever I see you,

428
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,640
I feel bad about asking you for food all the time.

429
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,080
- All of a sudden?
- And plus,

430
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,200
you shot a video with us, too.

431
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,300
I can't just do nothing.
I had to at least buy you a meal.

432
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,900
Is that why you wanted to see me?

433
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,150
You didn't have something to say?

434
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,050
What is there for me to say to you in particular?

435
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,380
You wouldn't have come if I said
I was buying you a meal.

436
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,790
That's why I just said that.

437
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,450
Hey, I don't think you need
to buy me a meal to thank me.

438
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,380
And I'm not a stranger to you.

439
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,620
Even siblings can't just get help for free.

440
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,080
You sound like an adult.

441
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,220
I'm already an adult.

442
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,090
And since you went to college in the US,

443
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,880
you probably haven't tried fun food
like this in Korea in your early 20s.

444
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,890
No. You're right.

445
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,840
You don't know Gangster Ttteokbokki, do you?

446
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,300
Have you been to Hongdae? How about Seongsu-dong?

447
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,550
 

448
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,370
Yes, hello?

449
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,600
This is Lee Ji Hyeok, the CEO of Custom Homes.

450
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,570
Yes. We've talked over the phone once.

451
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,910
Yes. You told me to call
after receiving the investment.

452
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,040
Yes.

453
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,170
I'll send you a zip file of the stuff
my sunbae developed.

454
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:32,540
Let's discuss the details during the meeting. Okay.

455
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,660
Oh, here.

456
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,220
There's a five-year-old boy in this family.

457
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,020
I thought it'd be nice to round this corner
between the playroom and the living room.

458
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,610
Why are you doing this now?

459
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,080
This wasn't included in the quote.

460
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,100
Do it the same way you did before.

461
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,090
Cut a piece of plywood and bend it slightly.

462
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,160
Geez...

463
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,630
Your face has gotten so thin
since the last time I saw you.

464
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,530
You want to provide a complimentary service now?

465
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,360
Why are you always like this, Manager Ji?

466
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,090
I told you when we discussed the lighting.

467
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,910
Their budget is pretty tight.

468
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,000
Gosh. Okay. I'll do it.

469
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,320
Thank you.

470
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,530
I'll provide top-quality snacks tomorrow.

471
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,670
It'd better be top-quality.

472
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,000
Let's clean up and go home.

473
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,320
 Okay. 

474
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,290
 

475
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,550
Hi, Mom. I'm leaving soon.

476
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,680
 No, no, no. 

477
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,490
Don't come to the shop. Go home.

478
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,200
I closed the shop.

479
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,510
Why?

480
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,020
Gang Oh called me.

481
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,350
He told us to come home because
he had something to say.

482
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,030
At home?

483
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,860
Okay. I'll be there soon.

484
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,100
 

485
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,620
Hey, Su Jeong. I won't be able
to stop by the cafe today.

486
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,940
Gang Oh is home, apparently.

487
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,390
What did he say?

488
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,990
He won't say anything, saying
he wants to talk when you arrive.

489
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,080
My heart has been racing because of that.

490
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,570
Let's go out. Let's talk privately.

491
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,260
Mom needs to hear this, too.

492
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,830
Sit on the floor, then.

493
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,980
Sit, Mom.

494
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,500
Yeah...

495
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,000
Where have you been?

496
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,260
You should've called Mom.
Don't you know she was worried?

497
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,860
I've been too busy thinking.

498
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,450
I've been thinking a lot.

499
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,190
- So?
- I mean,

500
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:25,020
is that something you should think a lot about?

501
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,900
I knew you'd be like this.

502
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,910
You didn't tell Mom, did you?

503
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,600
About my anger and resentment.

504
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,920
About the loss I suffered.

505
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,590
What are you talking about?

506
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,500
Listen carefully, Mom.

507
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,250
She's not related to us, but all the
money you and Dad spent on her.

508
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,260
And the privileges she enjoyed.

509
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,880
I think she took what should've been mine.

510
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,520
- What?
- So,

511
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,190
pay me back the money Dad spent on you.

512
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,340
Give me 20 million first.

513
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,950
What did you say?

514
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,520
Gang Oh, what are you saying right now?

515
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,140
The things she took from me.

516
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,070
I'm telling her to pay me back what was mine.

517
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,700
If she wants to keep living with you, Mom.

518
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,500
Are you crazy? Huh?

519
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,180
Eun Oh is your sister.

520
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,020
She's Mom and Dad's daughter.

521
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,610
She isn't like that to me.

522
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,840
I'm all about the bloodline, Mom.

523
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,370
So, stop yelling at me.

524
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,170
I'm your real child.

525
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,140
Ji Eun Oh was adopted.

526
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,090
She's not your real child.

527
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,360
How could you be like this, Gang Oh?

528
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,260
She's your sister!

529
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,970
She has always been your sister
since you were born.

530
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,550
How could you be so cruel to her?

531
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,360
Because she's not my birth sister.

532
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,760
I have fond memories with her,
but do you know what I think of more?

533
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,170
You always bought things for her first at stores

534
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,160
and what she wanted to eat first.

535
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,100
I wanted the Ubis puffer jacket so badly,

536
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,690
but I got the South jacket because of her.

537
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,140
I could've kept playing soccer,
but I couldn't because of her.

538
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,790
That's because you weren't good enough.
How's that her fault?

539
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,110
I wanted to go to the special camp
in the UK. Why didn't you let me?

540
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,700
Because it was too expensive.

541
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,100
Gosh, you bastard!

542
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,150
It was right after Dad's business went bankrupt.

543
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,960
If you saved the money you spent on Ji Eun Oh,

544
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,480
Dad might not have gone bankrupt, either.

545
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,560
- What did you say?
- Should I go on?

546
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,380
I can keep going all night.

547
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,600
No. Stop.

548
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,200
What will you do with the 20 million this time?

549
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,500
It's none of your business.

550
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,630
Just give me the money. Give me all
of your savings, borrow money, or get a loan.

551
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,190
No.

552
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,560
I'm not going to do anything.

553
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,060
I won't give you my money.

554
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,410
What did you say?

555
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,790
The 20 million I lent you...

556
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,890
I mean, the 24 million.

557
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:59,100
You haven't even paid me back 10 won of it.

558
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,170
I told you to pay me back, didn't I?

559
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,150
You won't give me the money?

560
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,370
Your shamelessness is out of this world.

561
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,920
Gang Oh, watch what you say.

562
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,090
If you don't give me that money,
you can't live in this house.

563
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,980
Who says she can't?

564
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,800
Listen carefully.

565
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,570
I won't give you even 1 won of my money.

566
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,630
Pay me back what you borrowed from me last time.

567
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,540
Help Mom at the shop until it closes.

568
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,160
Wow. I can't believe this.

569
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,850
Ji Eun Oh,

570
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,960
who are you related to?
And why are you so shameless?

571
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,240
Where are you from?

572
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,830
My gosh. Oh, no, Gang Oh.

573
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,660
My goodness.

574
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,200
Gang Oh, please. Gang Oh.

575
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,930
Gang Oh.

576
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,660
Is it me or Ji Eun Oh?

577
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,960
What did you say, Gang Oh?

578
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,170
I can't live in the same house with her.

579
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,720
So, make a choice. Is it her or me?

580
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,070
It's Eun Oh.

581
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,800
My daughter.

582
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,750
Your sister.

583
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,150
You chose her?

584
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,350
Okay.

585
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,880
Fine.

586
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,220
Have a nice life with her.

587
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,410
Gang Oh, why are you doing this?

588
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,900
What do you mean? You're the one
who told me to leave.

589
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,850
Gang Oh, you can't do this.

590
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:38,620
You know what she did after Dad passed away.

591
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,350
We're making a living through
the shop, thanks to her.

592
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,910
Why are you doing this?

593
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,550
That's nothing in comparison.

594
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,380
So, have a nice life with her and just abandon me.

595
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,710
Gang Oh, why are you doing this?

596
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,490
Gang Oh!

597
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,760
 

598
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,640
Gang Oh.

599
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,030
Gang Oh. Gang Oh.

600
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,700
- No, Gang Oh.
- What do you mean, no?

601
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,250
If you leave now,

602
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,080
you and I are over.

603
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,260
I'll never see you again.

604
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,290
Give me a break.

605
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:24,000
We shouldn't have met from the beginning.

606
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,200
Tell Mom she can't see me again
unless she turns things back to normal.

607
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,250
Gang Oh. Gang Oh!

608
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,180
Gang Oh! Gang Oh.

609
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,830
Gang Oh!

610
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,440
Crazy bastard. How dare he say all that?

611
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,380
Eun Oh.

612
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,850
Mom,

613
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,860
let's not say anything tonight.

614
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,640
Are you hungry?

615
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,090
No.

616
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,610
What do you mean, no? You are.

617
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,120
Your lunch box only had salad in it.

618
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,960
Hey, let me ask you just one thing.

619
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,460
Why do you always have to eat salads?

620
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,420
It's for health and self-care.

621
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,610
You aren't trying to become a celebrity.

622
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,780
You're thin now. Why are you on a diet?

623
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,630
Besides, I'm sure painters need to be strong, too.

624
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,530
Didn't you hear what I said?

625
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,500
Let's...

626
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,400
go back to being a driver and Ms. Park.

627
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,950
What?

628
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,000
I feel uncomfortable.

629
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,430
About what?

630
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,300
About you.

631
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,110
So, you just want me to drive?

632
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,610
Like at first? Treat you formally?

633
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,230
No. I won't go back.

634
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,460
I quit. Tell your mom.

635
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,690
Okay.

636
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,290
You're taking good care of yourself.

637
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,270
My daughter is the best.

638
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,580
Mom, did you find a new driver yet?

639
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,100
Why? Did something happen?

640
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,430
No. He's still a temp.

641
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,760
Right? I knew you'd feel anxious, too.

642
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,350
There are two candidates left.

643
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,900
I'll decide tomorrow or the day after.

644
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,470
 With the new technology they developed, 

645
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,790
they won an award at an invention
expo in Silicon Valley.

646
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,090
They're receiving many inquiries
in Europe, not just in the US.

647
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,070
What about the buyer from Italy
who wanted to see the Gangnam store?

648
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,280
Who will be helping him?

649
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,140
Director Yun will be there with Team Leader Kang.

650
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,340
I'll come, too.

651
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,450
You will?

652
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,820
Europe is the only place we don't have a store.

653
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,030
We should host him with extra care.

654
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,770
Tag along with Director Yun and check things out.

655
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,070
- Okay. I won't step in.
- Okay.

656
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,530
Well, then.

657
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,360
What's gotten into him?

658
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,190
He's volunteering to do something?

659
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,590
What's the deal?

660
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,190
 

661
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,800
Lee Ji Hyeok, this is just the beginning.

662
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,700
 

663
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,400
 

664
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,040
You said you need the initial investment urgently.

665
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,060
Fifty million will be sent immediately.

666
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,210
The other 50 million will
be sent within this month.

667
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,820
Thank you.

668
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,950
 

669
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,920
 

670
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,490
 
Okay. Okay!

671
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,770
What are you withdrawing for?

672
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:24,920
Well, it's an outstanding payment for a contractor.

673
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,210
You could wire it, then.

674
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,850
No. I'll take one 10 million bill,
one five million bill, and three million bills.

675
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,860
Could you issue those for me?

676
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,060
Honey! This is what I was talking about.

677
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,650
I love it! My gosh.

678
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,320
It took money, but the kitchen looks a lot more premium.

679
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,510
The bathroom grading looks good.
The grout work looks clean, too.

680
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,630
It's all thanks to Manager Ji.

681
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,110
Thank you for taking good care of everything.

682
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,290
Don't mention it.

683
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,200
Good luck with the move.

684
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,937
Contact Custom Homes if you notice any issues.

685
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:06,980
Okay.

686
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,470
Custom Homes will be in charge
of the after-service.

687
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,740
Honey, check this out.

688
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,470
Look at this glide.

689
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,680
You're going to the cafe, right?

690
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,880
Let's grab lunch together.

691
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,910
We finished construction.

692
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,280
Should I still call you Manager Ji?

693
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,660
Isn't that obvious?

694
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,320
I thought we agreed to do that.

695
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,100
Since the first project went well,

696
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,820
let's eat together, Manager Ji.

697
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,150
It's okay. I'll go.

698
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,570
Wait...

699
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,780
Well, I'm only asking for lunch.

700
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,820
Have a meal with the CEO of Custom Homes.

701
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,560
I don't want to.

702
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,640
You don't have to look out for me.

703
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,630
You don't have to worry, either.

704
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:23,190
Then...

705
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,580
here. Take this.

706
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,870
It's 18 million won minus the
two million, the contract fee.

707
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,940
What?

708
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,660
Did you think I wouldn't pay you what I promised?

709
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,950
I can't believe this.

710
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,570
Where did you get this much money?

711
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,470
I received an investment.

712
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:00,130
Double-S Startup is officially our investor.

713
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:01,690
Here.

714
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,680
That's great.

715
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,380
Here.

716
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,800
Why would you give this to me?

717
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,230
I only worked as a coordinator.

718
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,930
I'll only get paid for that.

719
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,270
No.

720
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,100
I agreed to pay you 20 million
since I scouted you.

721
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,450
You were supposed to receive that much.

722
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,800
That's what the contract says.

723
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,300
So, what's wrong?

724
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,490
Are you feeling sorry for me?

725
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,530
It's not that.

726
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,350
I just want to feel better.

727
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,180
This is your problem.

728
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,100
You're acting too proud when
you're facing your situation right now.

729
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,810
Why won't you receive the money you're owed?

730
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,840
You should be asking for more.

731
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,890
Why do you keep nagging?

732
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,570
How dare you nag me?

733
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,980
Why do you keep criticizing?

734
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,200
Ji Eun Oh,

735
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,370
you might hate me forever,

736
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:18,560
but you're just Ji Eun Oh to me.

737
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:22,510
Ever since I first met you after
returning to school until now.

738
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,180
You can dislike me or hate me.

739
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,920
Maybe you could do that, but I can't.

740
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,400
How could I?

741
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:40,150
I reserved a taxi to drive
with you to a restaurant.

742
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,260
Let's go to the cafe together.

743
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,520
I want to go alone.

744
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,450
Wait...

745
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:11,880
 Ji Eun Oh, who are you related to?
And why are you so shameless? 

746
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,170
 Where are you from? 

747
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,090
Eun Oh.

748
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,220
Director.

749
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:09,900
Are you okay?

750
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:14,830
Hop on my back.

751
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,000
Gosh. Why are you so light?

752
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,800
Could you prepare a seat for Eun Oh?

753
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,390
I think she needs to lie down.

754
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,880
This way.

755
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:41,320
- Hold on.
- Okay.

756
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,000
What happened?

757
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,050
I ran into her on the streets.

758
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,760
Did she faint?

759
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,100
Almost.

760
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,950
Is it exhaustion or...

761
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,440
is she shocked because of
what happened with Gang Oh?

762
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,400
Where were you headed?

763
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,450
I need to get going. I'm meeting a buyer.

764
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,500
Maybe I should've taken her to a hospital.

765
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,600
No. She seems asleep. I'll keep an eye on her.

766
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,380
Okay. Take care of her for me.

767
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,730
Why would he say that?

768
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,860
Sunbae, are you okay?

769
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,380
Yes. It's okay because I don't have to type.

770
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,210
Go back to tending the cafe.

771
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,770
I asked if he was okay.

772
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:49,360
Don't get up suddenly.

773
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,030
Unless you want to get dizzy and faint again.

774
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,490
I owe you one.

775
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,570
Then, eat with people when they ask you to.

776
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,800
You don't need my help, right?

777
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,800
No.

778
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,410
I remember the Director carrying me.

779
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,070
You haven't eaten or slept, right?

780
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,790
I guess I haven't.

781
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,700
What else?

782
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,010
Something happened with Gang Oh again, huh?

783
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,860
Ever since you went home to see
Gang Oh a few days ago,

784
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,520
you've been so out of it.

785
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,660
Get her some porridge.

786
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,010
Min Woo, I'll go get some porridge with Manager Ji.

787
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,700
Try to manage it on your own.

788
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,060
Okay.

789
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:19,870
No. The cafe will get busy soon.

790
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:23,470
It's okay. I need to hear about what happened, too.

791
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,270
Welcome.

792
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,480
- It must be a famous place.
- They're good.

793
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,510
It's a generous spread.

794
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:05,100
Da Jeong, you must feel better
since you came out to see us.

795
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,510
Of course. Time heals, they say.

796
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,170
How is Sang Cheol?

797
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,860
Is he doing well, working as
an advisor at that company?

798
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,540
Don't bring up my husband.

799
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,890
He can manage himself.

800
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:21,370
What else would we talk about
if not our husbands and kids?

801
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,730
Politics?

802
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,700
We're just keeping each other updated.

803
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,700
Do you want to hear Myeong Hui
and me complain about our jobs?

804
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,040
Yes. I have so much to talk about today.

805
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,630
Your situations are obvious.

806
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,320
I'm curious about Ji Hyeok.

807
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,470
What about my Ji Hyeok?

808
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,450
Has he finally come to his senses?

809
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,560
What?

810
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,730
I don't know how he got suckered
into a chaebol's daughter,

811
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,320
but it got him really good
for dreaming up nonsense.

812
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,990
Hey, has your son even been proposed
to by a chaebol's daughter?

813
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:00,470
Gosh. Listen to her.

814
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,830
So what if she proposed?

815
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,730
I heard she ran away with another man.

816
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,340
Mi Yeong, that's enough.

817
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,680
I know you guys are curious. I'm asking for you.

818
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,430
Mi Yeong, I heard your husband is
cheating for the third time.

819
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,000
W-What? The third time?

820
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,250
Hey, no. It's the second time-

821
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,900
I see. The third one was just a rumor.

822
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,030
Can you prove that Ji Hyeok's fiancée ran away?

823
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,570
No, right?

824
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,740
Also, what's it like to live with a husband

825
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,390
who cheated for the second or third time?

826
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,450
Are you okay? Are you barely surviving?

827
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:44,870
- Hey, Kim Da Jeong!
- So, watch your mouth, girl.

828
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,970
Your nickname was Blabbermouth
even back in high school.

829
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:52,250
Does criticizing my son make
your cheating husband come back?

830
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,330
It's okay if I talk about your husband, right?

831
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,660
You guys, I'll call her Major Blabbermouth
from now on.

832
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,880
Guys, how could you do this to me?

833
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,260
You provoked her first.

834
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,590
Let's eat, Da Jeong.

835
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:13,140
We actually wanted to get together
to cheer you up today.

836
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,530
I know. But I already feel better.

837
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:19,130
So, forget about that part.

838
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,290
I'm still treating you to this meal.

839
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,920
What are you talking about?

840
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,630
I made you come to the wedding for no reason.

841
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,660
Major Blabbermouth spent money on her ride today.

842
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,700
I should treat you guys.

843
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,060
Let's eat.

844
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,160
Okay. Let's eat.

845
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,860
Ji Hyeok,

846
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,720
I miss you so much.

847
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,930
When are you coming back?

848
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:54,820
Where are you, and what are you doing?

849
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,820
You bastard.

850
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,940
Try hiding for a year.

851
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,250
Would you stop feeling ashamed, then?

852
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,570
All you can do is admit your faults

853
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:10,050
and move on from it, you bastard.

854
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,050
I said I was home. Why didn't you answer?

855
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,410
What are you doing?

856
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,590
I'm eating.

857
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:29,630
But...

858
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:32,470
Gosh, I'm hungry...

859
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:37,300
You should be making dinner.
Why are you eating alone?

860
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,240
Do I have to make dinner every night?

861
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,940
I can eat early sometimes.

862
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:47,980
Honey, did something happen?

863
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,060
It obviously did. What do you think?

864
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,210
Okay, then. I'll make ramen-

865
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,230
That ramen of yours.

866
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:01,860
Men always eat ramen as if
they're making a sacrifice.

867
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,910
There are side dishes, frozen rice,
and soup in the fridge.

868
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,540
Why can't you feed yourself with that?

869
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:12,170
S-Su Bin, what am I supposed
to do at times like this?

870
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:15,800
- I'll prepare your meal, Dad.
- Gosh, I'm hungry.

871
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,120
Something smells tasty.

872
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,430
Mother,

873
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,260
do you mind eating bibimbap?

874
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,730
We have some marinated vegetables.

875
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,380
Okay. Let's eat that.

876
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:48,370
What's gotten into her?

877
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,610
What else would it be?

878
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:55,130
It's because of her son.

879
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,730
Kim Da Jeong,

880
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,960
won't you tell me what happened?

881
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:10,060
I miss Ji Hyeok.

882
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,660
Is that it?

883
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:17,410
Doesn't he miss home?

884
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:25,300
There's a good co-working space
for a meeting near my office.

885
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,190
Would you like to come this way?

886
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:31,170
I have no problem working all night.

887
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:32,970
Yes. I'll prepare everything and meet you there.

888
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,400
Okay. See you there. Bye.

889
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:37,510
 ♫ It's okay not to tell me ♫ 

890
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:43,910
 ♫ Lean on me and close your eyes ♫ 

891
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:47,870
 ♫ And you'll feel better ♫ 

892
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,620
 Mom, you're still awake. 

893
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,290
 Hey, Eun Oh. You came home earlier than I thought. 

894
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:57,110
 - Let go!
- What are you doing? 

895
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,560
 Who the hell are you? 

896
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,340
 I'm her dad. Why do you ask? 

897
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,910
 Something serious happened to Ms. Ji. 

898
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:05,810
 And it turns out there are two men around Ms. Ji. 

899
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,040
 What's that? 

900
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,520
 I'm confessing my love.
Don't we make a pretty nice couple? 

901
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,530
 Go out with me. 

902
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:14,770
 Ji Eun Oh. Ji Eun Oh! 

903
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:16,930
 Are you okay? Were you hurt? 

904
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:19,830
 Are you stupid? Can't you think? 

905
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,380
 She makes me worry for so many reasons. 

906
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,460
 ♫ A tiring day ♫
