30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,980
Yes, Sir.

31
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,880
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes.

I'm not sure how you like your coffee.

You can add sugar and milk yourself.

34
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,640
I don't need coffee.

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,000
I have a few things to tell you.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,420
Then I'll go back to the company.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,776
Go ahead.

Shen Yan, I think this is the end for us.

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,920
Thank you for asking me out. You've granted my mom's wish.

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,020
What do you mean?

41
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,580
I know you don't really like me.

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,920
Your main purpose to date me is my mobile game project, isn't it?

43
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,340
Since you've said it openly, I won't prevaricate, either.

44
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,520
What are your thoughts about your project's ownership?

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,700
Are you willing to collaborate with Hechuan,

46
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,936
or do you want to leave Z Mobile Games and join us directly?

47
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,060
I can get you the best offer.

48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,048
Thank you, but I'm sorry. I don't plan to leave Z Mobile Games.

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,180
Actually, I'm a very ordinary girl.

50
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,960
Not long ago, I had much bad luck,

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,600
but I really like Z Mobile Games.

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,140
Working there makes me feel close to my dreams.

53
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,240
It motivates me to work hard with everyone to achieve a goal.

54

I've reviewed my project carefully. It's not finished yet.

And Gu…

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,448
Somebody told me the truth.

57
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:42,180
Many projects

58
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,860
in the Association Contest are more mature and promising than mine.

59
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,680
Mine was voted first because I got really lucky.

Nuan Nuan.

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,880
- Actually…
- My project isn't mature yet.

62
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,980
So far, I only finished a first script and scene sketches.

63
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,136
A lot needs work: building, modeling, programming, testing, etc.

64
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:06,500
I don't even know if I could even finish it,

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,860
let alone have the confidence to sell it.

66
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,220
I appreciate your kindness. I hope to see you in the future.

67
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,280
As for blind dates, let's just forget that.

68
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,660
Our colleagues still work hard on the next project.

69
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll go back and join them

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,820
so if you'll excuse me,

71
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,444
I'll leave now.

72
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:27,060

It's about my project.

99
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,600
In the past few days, besides learning from major art designers,

100
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,860

My project is not ready yet.

104
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,128
I still had many flaws in details,

105
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:18,760
scenes, and modeling.

106
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,644

Oh, right, Ming Yang is here.

153
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,920
detention in the art room at university was scary enough.

Of course not. I always wished to be an original artist.

00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:56,060
this represents my work at Z Mobile Games.

163
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,420
Sister Xin Ran, what's the matter?

164
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,300
You seem a little down.

165
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,400
It's nothing, I'm just…

166
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,440
Did that brat, Ming Yang, borrow money from you again?

167
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,380
Just wait and I'll straighten him out.

168
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,040
No, don't. Ming Yang didn't borrow money from me.

169
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,280
Then what happened?

170
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,264
Could it be you've had the same bad luck I had?

171
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,220
Don't worry. I will use my secret weapon to help you.

172
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,400
What's that?

173
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,180
It will help you find your other half.

174
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,200
Maybe when you find him,

175
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,360
all your troubles and bad luck will disappear.

176
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,060
Sister Xin Ran, your aura has turned pink!

177
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
You just have to find someone

178
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,560
who has pink bubbles like you, and you won't have bad luck.

179
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,800
What pink bubbles? Which other half?

180
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,180
Zhao Nuan Nuan, stop reading those comic books.

181
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,380
Focus on your work.

182
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,540
<i>Pink is the color of love, isn't it?</i>

183
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,080
<i>Sweet love is finally coming to Sister Xin Ran.</i>

184

<i>Ever since I met Mr. Shiny Lucky Charm,</i>

185
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,940
<i>it really seems I've encountered happy things:</i>

186
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,140
<i>I have a job I like. I can work on my own project,</i>

187
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,800
<i>and I can pursue my true dream.</i>

188
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,700
<i>I'm really so lucky!</i>

189
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,800
Thank you for leading me to the happiest other half of my life.

190
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,720
Now, I'll work harder together

191
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,500
for the project and my life!

192
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,300
- Boss, we received two pieces of information.
- Slow down and tell me.

193
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,020
Our server launch tonight has very good reviews from major media outlets.

194
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,540
Also, our reservation numbers are well ahead

195
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,420
of the peak reservation traffic for Legend of the Mighty I.

196
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,440
Then the server provider called to confirm the number of servers.

197
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,260
Request a large reservation. We can add servers as needed.

198
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,840
Adding servers after testing starts… I fear the main program won't support it.

199
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,040
I'll decide that.

200
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,704
Anything else?

201
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:50,920
The operations team said they found a small article

202
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,440
on a pro mobile gaming site that posted after our internal test.

203
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,640
A small part contained our source code and has been tested.

204
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,500
Show it to me.

205
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,520
Qiao Nan, get the Chief Programmer!

206
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,340
What's wrong?

207
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,800
Our internal test source code was leaked.

208
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,690
What's going on?

209
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,000
Yao Yao, what's going on? What happened?

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,832
Something has happened!

211
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,000
There was a leak of our internal testing source code.

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
Now someone has found a program bug,

213
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,680
which could lead to major flaws in the game.

214
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,900
If that is the case, our losses will be huge.

215
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,580
- How did this happen?
- The President has called for an emergency meeting.

216
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,460
We may need to make major adjustments prior to the server launch at midnight.

217
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,820
I'll check this plan first.

218
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,840
Later, I can confirm it with President Gu.

219
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,800
There's no time.

220
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,820
As you all know, our long-promoted game, Legend of the Mighty II, is about to go public.

221
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,760
However, a sizable portion of the source code was leaked,

222
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,300
and the main program may have a significant loophole.

223
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,720
I told you!

224
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
- This is no good!
- This is a mess.
- What do we do now?

225
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:49,752
Silence. Did I say to panic?

226
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:52,352
Is this your adaptability level after working with me?

227
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:57,980
Just so you know, this mobile game will go live at midnight tonight, not a second later.

228
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,660
Since a major bug was found, fix it quietly within six hours.

229
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,120
We can't let other platforms catch this loophole and drag us down,

230
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,000
especially Hechuan.

and independent mobile game bloggers.

- How many code sections do we have?
- Only two sections left.

246
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,240
If those two are stolen, all that's left is the source code.

247
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,220
Old Chen, I remember during internal testing, this source code section was backed up.

248
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,160
If we use the backup copy to replace it, can we do it in time?

249
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,780
CEO Gu, although it may work, the whole window and interface are locked.

250
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,880
If the logic code needs a sizeable replacement,

251
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,140
then the entire front-end interface design must be changed.

252
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,660
Would it be difficult if I asked for a new interface design in six hours?

253
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,780
CEO Gu, you're asking too much from us.

254
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,020
Although it's a small module, all logic, interface, scene maps,

255
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,980
and all designs must be changed.

256
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,000
I asked you a simple question. Yes or no?

257
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,340
Although we do have a backup… the character scenes and the large map…

258
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,952
Teacher.

259

What can you do?

261
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,420
I can modify the characters and scene maps.

262
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,080
There are forty pictures and only six hours. Can you finish them?

263
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:01,300
I can.

264
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,620
We can't finish in six hours.

265
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,120
How is that possible in six hours? That's ridiculous.

266
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,116
- It's impossible in six hours.
- Okay, then it's decided.

267
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,240
Replace the source code instantly, change the interface design,

268
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,640
and request new backup servers from the server provider.

269
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,620
We have only five hours. Act now, immediately.

- Okay.

325

<i>It's the real power of the industry's top mobile gaming company!</i>

327
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,740
Great! This is great!

328
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,480
We did it! Awesome!

329
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,960
Amazing!

330
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,540
<i>Hello? Yes, we've received it.</i>

331
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,400
<i>[Game popularity graphs]</i>

332
00:25:45,404 --> 00:25:47,592
- Gu Yi Chen?
- Yes.

333
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,880
Nuan Nuan, come try my honey-roasted chicken wings.

334
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,080
Why did you turn the TV off? I haven't seen the rest yet.

335
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,300
There's nothing much to see.

336
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,880
A feud of the male and female, lovers ended up as siblings.

337
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,460
- What?
- Don't listen to her nonsense.

338
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,860
They are clearly in love and stand together against all odds.

339
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,068
They will love each other for the rest of their lives.

340
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:21,320
Wicked Nuan Nuan, you scared me.

341
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,780
- But...
- Nuan Nuan, your reaction was very suspicious.

342
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,912
You turned off the TV when you saw them kissing.

343
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:32,700
What are you guilty of?

344
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,400
I'm not guilty.

345
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,680
Yes, you are. Your face is totally red.

346
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,192
Your face reminded me of an idiom I just learned.

347
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:46,840
"It's as red as a monkey's behind."

348
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,980
A monkey's behind is an idiom?

349
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,056
Mi Mi, have you been learning Chinese from a P.E. teacher?

350
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,660
Don't change the subject.

351
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,860
Zhao Nuan Nuan, confess the truth.

352
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,200
I have nothing to confess.

353
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,780
This morning, I saw President Gu leave the Original Art Studio

354
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,380
looking just as Nuan Nuan does now,

355
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,440
both red and awkward.

356
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,520
Although his presidential aura was still there,

357
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,880
it was completely different from usual.

358
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,680
Now Nuan Nuan is behaving like this.

359
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,560
Tell us the truth, what exactly did you guys do in the studio?

360
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,448
- Speak up.
- No. We didn't do anything.

361
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,616
Nuan Nuan and President Gu?

362
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:35,380
President Gu and Nuan Nuan?

363
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,488
Nuan Nuan and President Gu are dating!

364
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:41,260
Dating.

365
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,360
No, no. I'm really not dating him.

366
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,960
This morning in the studio, we just accidentally kissed…

367
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,204
You accidentally k-kissed?

368
00:27:58,204 --> 00:28:00,700
The mouth-to-mouth kind?

369
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,560
President Gu and Nuan Nuan kissed.

370
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,760
I must take out my phone and record this moment.

371
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,720
I also need to tell Senior Qiao Nan.

372
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,880
Don't go around spreading rumors.

373
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,000
The ink isn't even dry yet.

374
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,420
How can I go to work tomorrow with you acting like this?

375
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,100
It was just an accidental k-kiss with him.

376
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,720
He didn't say he liked me.

377
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,760
So that's what's troubling you.

378
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,780
It's not your first day at Z Mobile Games.

379
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,968
You all know how President Gu is.

380
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:31,940
Besides, I was in the company three years.

381
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,460
I've never seen President Gu dating, let alone scandals.

382
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,220
Also, President Gu is very serious and sincere about his work and his life.

383
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,768
If he kissed you, it means he likes you.

384
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:49,340
- Exactly! He competes with me daily for Senior Qiao Nan.
- What?

385
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,960
President Gu does not reveal his feelings easily.

386
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,180
If he's so close to you, he must like you.

387
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,220
That's right. President Gu likes you.

388
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,700
<i>I'm sorry. The tea room offers only bottled tea.</i>

389
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,552
<i>You don't mind, do you?</i>

390
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,780
<i>This is my company. Of course, I don't mind.</i>

391
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,500
<i>I almost forgot you're my boss.</i>

392
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,548
<i>Why do you like to drink milk?</i>

393
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,840
<i>I see other people's bosses are always…</i>

394
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,800
<i>"Bring me a cup of black coffee. No sugar."</i>

395
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,620
<i>Another chapter in the "Other People's Boss" series?</i>

396
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,940
<i>Who says a company boss can't drink milk?</i>

397
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,880
<i>Milk is rich in protein and calcium. It's easy to absorb and strengthens the body.</i>

398
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,836
<i>Why shouldn't I drink it?</i>

399
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,140
<i>Because... it's not presidential enough.</i>

400
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,080
<i>And what about you? Why do you drink black coffee?</i>

401
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,760
<i>It refreshes and wakes me up.</i>

402
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,040
<i>When pressure is too high, and I could drop dead,</i>

403
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,400
<i>one cup keeps me drawing "another 500 years."</i>

404
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,624
<i>The battle is over for tonight.</i>

405
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:59,060
<i>You don't need to draw another 500 years.</i>

406
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:05,780
<i>Nuan Nuan, why do you work so hard at drawing?</i>

407
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,920
<i>For my mobile game dream.</i>

408
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,480
<i>Didn't I say so during my interview?</i>

409
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,600
<i>I really love comics, and I really love mobile games.</i>

410
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,700
<i>My biggest dream is to create a mobile game of our own,</i>

411
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,120
<i>not borrowed or brought from abroad,</i>

412
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,080
<i>but a mobile game that truly belongs to us.</i>

413
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,140
<i>I want those who look down on our national originality</i>

414
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,860
<i>to realize we have the power to create superb, unique mobile games.</i>

415
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,800
<i>Then we can use the project to get them to play our game.</i>

416
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,860
<i>Let them understand our country,</i>

417
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,120
<i>and fall in love with our country's 5,000 years of glorious culture.</i>

418
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,808
<i>What about you? Why did you start Z Mobile Games?</i>

419
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:49,180
<i>Why did you want to create games?</i>

420
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,540
<i>For… happiness.</i>

421
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,460
<i>Aren't you happy?</i>

422
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,740
<i>Mobile games, films, cultural creativity, and novels are similar.</i>

423
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,680
<i>They all make people dream.</i>

424
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,780
<i>When I run the company, I can be like the characters I create:</i>

425
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,540
<i>Break the darkness, overcome difficulties, and grow against the odds.</i>

426
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,020
<i>I create mobile games in hopes to be like the game characters.</i>

<i>Aren't you the same?</i>

430
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:38,276
<i>What's wrong?</i>

431
00:31:38,276 --> 00:31:40,720
<i>Did I smear it on my lips?</i>

432
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,420
<i>Gu, President Gu,</i>

433
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,120
<i>I told you to call me Yi Chen.</i>

434
