Nuan Nuan,

28
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:58,480
I…

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,996
I do like you.

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,840
What kind of weird dream was that?

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,520
How could I dream about Gu Yi Chen?

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,280
Why is it all packed ready?

33
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:34,220
- Is this it, Xin Ran?
- Yes, it is.

34
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,360
Sorry, Guys! Last night I…

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,200
Xin Ran, this is the background video.

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,250
Mi Mi, this is the character design reference.

Guys, what's wrong?

39
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:56,340
Kitty Nuan Nuan, did someone confess his feelings to you last night?

40
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:33,800
That's hilarious.

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,268
Gu Yi Chen, I really misjudged you.

42
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,252
You're not an overbearing CEO

43
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:51,940
but a childish boy, who still hasn't graduated kindergarten!

44
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,820
Why can't I wipe this off?

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,340
Xin Ran, not you, too.

46
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,800
I don't know if we can hang out anymore.

47
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,696
Break up! Divorce!

48
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:09,500
I came to give you makeup remover wipes.

49
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,760
You can wipe off oil pen with only this.

50
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,600
That's more like it.

51
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,940
President Gu confessed his feelings for you?

52
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,240
What are you saying?

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,580
How could I possibly be with him?

54
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,680
Why not? You've kissed and held hands.

55
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,060
He even drew hearts on your face. He must like you.

56
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,780
He was…

57
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,220
Yesterday…

58
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,500
He gave me a hard time in the office yesterday,

59
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,180
then doodled on my face last night.

60
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,316
That's not how you like someone.

61
00:04:40,316 --> 00:04:43,480
For President Gu, who never had women around him,

62
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,040
he shows his feelings like this.

63
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,140
He likes you so he tugs your hair.

64
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,480
He likes you and draws hearts on your face. He likes you so kisses you.

65
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,260
Zhao Nuan Nuan, don't say you still don't understand his feelings?

66
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,260
How could that be?

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,420
Then let's try it again. What about you?

68
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,040
Me?

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,080
How do you feel about President Gu?

70
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,100
Do you like him?

71
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,980
I…

72
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,100
I don't like him at all.

73
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,964
All I think of are my dreams and work.

74
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:35,160
I need to finish my first roadshow.

75
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,460
I don't have time for feelings and love.

76
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,120
I have to work now.

77
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,740
My life is only work.

78
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,880
Work is my life.

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Gentle, it hurts. Pain!

80
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,720
Pain! Pain!

81
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,896
Hurry up!

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,620
Redo it.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,600
Replace the main project's poster.

84
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,460
The font needs changing.

85
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,680
Such a font has no advantages at a project launch.

86
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,288
<i>[Meeting You]</i>

87
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,470
<i>[Meeting You]</i>

88
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
Your favoritism

89
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,420
is too extreme, don't you think?

90
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,180
What are you talking about?

91
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,680
These four projects are going to be released tonight.

92
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,732
You were so strict with the first three,

93
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:31,140
but you just signed and approved the fourth one.

94
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,640
Your sense of equality is nonexistent.

95
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,060
This project may not be the best,

96
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,420
but each of its proposals has 3-4 alternatives.

97
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,148
There's no need for adjustments. It's already the perfect plan.

98
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:49,876
I used to think she was only good at drawing;

99
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:53,880
I didn't expect her to be a good copywriter.

100
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:59,652
Only those who are truly passionate about their projects can be so detailed and perfect.

101
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:02,900
Since her copywriting is so good,

102
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,780
how about transferring her to my team?

103
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,920
You wish.

104
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,680
What, can't you bear losing her?

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,260
You couldn't possibly have feelings for her, right?

106
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,220
Gu Yi Chen, no one else is here.

107
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,880
Tell me, have you really fallen for her?

108
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,480
Do you want me to pass a message for you?

109
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,260
Or should I help you pursue her?

110
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,616
Get lost.

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,480
Good for you, Gu Yi Chen.

112
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,100
No problem, we'll do as you say.

113
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,700
I'm going to lunch. I'll be back soon.

114
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,820
Great work, Guys.

115
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,380
Sorry, sorry.

116
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,120
- Shen Yan?
- Nuan Nuan.

117
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,160
I didn't expect to meet you here.

118
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,920
Almost all companies in the industry are participating in the Digital Expo.

119
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,444
That's true.

120
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:23,640
I just heard you on the phone.

121
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,200
Is it your project?

122
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,588
Yes, it's our company's project launch today.

123
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:32,540
My romance mobile game is one of them.

124
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,870
Really? Congratulations then.

125
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,708
I heard you've been working hard for this project.

126
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,656
Now you finally got what you wanted.

127
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:45,260
Not yet. It's just a teaser.

128
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,960
We're a long way from setting up a team and starting production.

129
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,180
With a start, you're one step closer to completion, right?

130
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,620
You're right.

131
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,420
As long as I work hard and cherish every opportunity,

132
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,100
I can make the project I want and fulfill my dream.

133
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,492
It seems Gu Yi Chen is really good to you.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,680
It's got nothing to do with him.

135
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,556
You and…

136
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:18,268
What?

137
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:20,500
Nothing.

138
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,220
But are you sure you won't come to Hechuan Technology?

139
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,400
If you join us, I promise to give you the best team and best treatment.

140
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,200
I can give you whatever I can mobilize.

141
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,756
Thank you for your trust,

142
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:39,860
but I'm doing very well at Z Mobile Games.

143
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,140
My colleagues care about me, and my seniors guide me well.

144
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,380
My boss

145
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,464
is also very nice.

146
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:50,860
I don't plan to leave Z Mobile Games.

147
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,220
Nuan Nuan.

148
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,260
Z Mobile Games is the company I've wanted to join since college.

149
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,920
Now, my work is doing well,

150
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,880
and my project made the company's potential launch.

151
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,388
Right now, all I want is to finish my project

152
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:09,800
and fulfill my dream.

153
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,160
I see.

154
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,840
I've caused you much trouble before, but it won't happen again.

155
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,180
Let's call it a day.

156
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,040
I should go.

157
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,960
- Finish your meal first.
- Maybe next time.

158
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,080
Wait, you dropped something.

159
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,020
This is our newly-hired vice president from the U.S.

160
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,460
Her name is Luo Yi.

161
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,800
Oh, right, I heard she and President Gu

162
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,784
were university acquaintances four years.

163
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:59,200
"Luo Yi"?

164
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,800
Maybe Hechuan Technology and Z Mobile Games won't be competitors anymore.

165
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,084
<i>Maybe Hechuan Technology and Z Mobile Games won't be competitors anymore.</i>

166
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,800
Not competitors,

167
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,240
then what will they be?

168
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,640
Surely not…

169
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:38,576
Boss, are you going to the launch this afternoon?

170
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,460
Won't the director of operations be there in person?

171
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,920
Yes, I arranged it.

172
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,784
But are you really not worried?

173
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:50,356
What's there to worry about?

174
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:52,400
Times have changed.

175
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,680
At this year's launch, a certain project's manager

176
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,560
will be there for the first time.

177
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,300
Also, it's their first time onstage making a statement.

178
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,148
If you don't go, are you really not worried? Won't you regret it?

179
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:13,496
That person is a Zhao.

180
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,920
Mr. Sheng, 24 hours of work for a day or a week, which do you choose?

181
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,960
What's the difference?

182
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,756
It seems you're not very satisfied.

183
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:31,612
Well, it's settled then: a month of overtime.

184
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:34,920
You're settling personal scores.

185
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,880
However, if you're willing to tell me whom you like,

186
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,700
I'll accept it, whatever it is.

187
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,460
Tell me, who is it?

188
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,480
Is she the one whom you like?

189
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,560
Whom I like, don't you know the answer?

190
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:01,560
Luo Yi?

191
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,416
- You!
-What are you doing? Stop it!

192
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,420
Mi Mi, have you seen Nuan Nuan?

193
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,620
Nuan Nuan seems to have gone to lunch now. Are you looking for her?

194
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,420
I want to confirm a few minor changes with her.

195
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,784
But I can't find her.

196
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:32,244
Why don't you check the break room?

197
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:34,960
Okay, I'm off then.

198
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,920
Isn't she…

199
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,440
<i>Whom I like, don't you know the answer?</i>

200
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,304
<i>Luo Yi?</i>

201
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,360
Liar! You already have someone you like.

202
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,340
Why did you treat me like that?

203
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,132
Why did you approach me?

204
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:11,844
Why were you so nice to me?

205
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,080
Why did you kiss me?

206
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,560
<i>He likes you so he tugs your hair.</i>

207
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,520
<i>He likes you and draws hearts on your face. He likes you so kisses you.</i>

208
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,480
<i>Zhao Nuan Nuan, don't say you still don't understand his feelings?</i>

209
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,536
<i>How do you feel about President Gu?</i>

210
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:34,160
<i>Do you like him?</i>

211
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,640
No, I don't.

212
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,560
I don't like him at all.

213
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,044
I absolutely hate him.

214
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,900
Nuan Nuan, what's wrong?

215
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,420
Sister Xin Ran.

216
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,148
What happened?

217
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:51,540
I heard you crying just now.

218
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,860
Nothing.

219
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,400
I just suddenly realized something.

220
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,100
I've thought it through.

221
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,720
I won't give up my dreams for love.

222
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,480
I must do the launch well and achieve my dream.

223
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,580
I don't need Gu Yi Chen.

224
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,200
I don't need love!

225
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:20,008
Rehearsal, right? Let's go.

226
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,180
Nuan Nuan, wait for one more thing.

227
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,990
The launch's host said to tell you, a Q and A session is later!

228
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,680
<i>[President Gu Yi Chen]</i>

00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:25,796
Nuan Nuan.

235
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,180
Nuan Nuan, what's wrong with you?

236
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,688
Why are you absent-minded since you returned this afternoon?

237
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,240
It's nothing.

238
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,840
Nuan Nuan, this is your first mobile game project launch

239
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,880
and a hard won opportunity.

240
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,412
You must grasp it well.

241
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:44,916
I know,

242
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,480
but Sister Xin Ran…

243
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,560
Nuan Nuan, you're no longer that unlucky one.

244
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,200
You achieved the best results by your own efforts.

245
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,760
Nuan Nuan, believe in yourself.

246
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,304
Okay, I will.

247
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:05,000
<i>I once walked a long road alone.</i>

248
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,160
<i>I once couldn't find the right way in the pitch black world,</i>

249
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,840
<i>until I met you.</i>

250
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,160
Welcome to Z Mobile Games project launch.

251
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,860
I'm the producer, Zhao Nuan Nuan.

252
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,340
I hereby introduce you to a beautiful romance mobile game, Meeting You.

253
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,940
This mobile game is a turn-based (take turns), women's romance,

254
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,936
joint effort of mine and Z Mobile Games.

255
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:43,280
Why we are creating this game is that for a long time,

256
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,640
Chinese mobile games for women

257
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,576
were monopolized by foreign companies.

258
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:49,240
Our female players

259
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,500
are forced to accept or give up games from other cultures.

260
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,320
Not only do we want to include more elements of our culture,

261
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,900
but we want to align with our female players' habits

262
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,160
using romantic plots and scenarios.

263
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,428
Nuan Nuan is amazing.

264
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,520
The idea is nice, but what about reality?

265
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,320
A mobile game for women, are you joking?

266
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,800
Boss, you have a video meeting tonight.

267
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,920
When exactly, let me look.

268
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,220
It should be…

269
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:43,700
- You go in my stead.
- Why?

270
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,040
I'll go to the conference center.

271
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,760
Wait, why do you suddenly leave?

272
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,160
A mobile game for women sounds classy,

273
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,840
but aren't there many such projects in the industry?

274
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,300
Do you know why foreign countries can monopolize this sector?

275
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,700
You think you're special, a trailblazer,

276
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,340
but do you know our domestic female players don't play mobile games?

277
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,420
I can answer your questions.

278
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,940
Domestic mobile games for women have taken a long time.

279
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,700
But why did many later projects fail on mobile platforms

280
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,424
then were abandoned by players?

281
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:35,420
First, many projects lacked longevity, performance, or storylines.

282
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,260
They were too monotonous.

283
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,460
Second, many mobile games for women

284
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,080
didn't optimize the experience and sense of immersion for female players.

285
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,820
In monopoly of foreign projects, you can see their early investments

286
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,712
in post-production, sound effects and voice acting.

287
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:55,880
Only with 100% dedication can you create a better project.

288
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,580
You talk big, but how do you improve user satisfaction?

289
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,380
How can you change that domestic women rarely play mobile games?

290
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,040
This is the most important point.

291
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:22,860
Xin Ran, what should we do?

292
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,840
Well…

293
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,428
What do we do?

294
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,580
<i>The domestic mobile game industry is not short of female players.</i>

295
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,848
♫ <i>Memories always inadvertently turn yellow</i> ♫

296
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,868
♫ <i>Good things always quietly fade away</i> ♫

297
00:21:56,868 --> 00:22:01,056
♫ <i>I always feel sad for no reason</i> ♫

298
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:04,960
♫ <i>Even a helpless smile can't hide it</i> ♫

299
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,535
♫ <i>I try hard to pretend, afraid the tears will fill</i> ♫

300
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:12,268
♫ <i>My eyes</i> ♫

301
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:19,974
♫ <i>The road to your heart is so long</i> ♫

302
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,080
- President Gu.
- President Gu is here!

303
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,340
The domestic mobile game industry is not short of female players.

304
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,980
<i>It's just that we mobile game companies</i>

305
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,780
<i>haven't created the best immersive gameplay for them.</i>

306
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,780
The domestic mobile game industry is not short of female players.

307
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,600
It's just that we mobile game companies

308
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,360
haven't created the best immersive gameplay for them.

309
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,820
If we want to improve user satisfaction…

310
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,860
We need to create the project to give players a sense of immersion.

311
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,760
No one wants to play a bad game.

312
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,000
All online and offline promotion or bonuses…

313
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,980
Would make players willingly come and play.

314
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,120
What really attracts players is always the mobile game's appeal itself.

315
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,860
It's the experience, sense of immersion, rewards and hopes.

316
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:16,940
♫ <i>Is anything still worthy for me to watch over?</i> ♫

317
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,956
♫ <i>Is anything still worthy for me to watch over?</i> ♫

318
00:23:23,956 --> 00:23:25,920
I'm more and more interested in Z Mobile Games' project.

319
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,420
Me, too. Especially the romance mobile game.

320
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,220
I wish they would launch it soon. I want to play it right away.

321
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:33,340
Me, too. Let's go home and pre-order.

322
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,132
Let's go.

323
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,600
Nuan Nuan, you were amazing just now.

324
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,160
Sister Xin Ran, have you seen…

325
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,960
What?

326
00:23:58,084 --> 00:23:59,940
Nothing.

327
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,960
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

328
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,224
Come on. Don't be a stranger.

329
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:26,772
Why is it you?

330
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:28,220
What kind of question is that?

331
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,680
Long time no see, aren't you happy to see me?

332
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,660
You're nothing to me anymore. Give me my things!

333
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,108
Nothing comes easy, remember?

334
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,708
What do you want then?

335
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,960
Kiss me, and I'll give it back to you.

336
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,440
Give it back. Right now!

337
00:24:52,748 --> 00:24:54,620
- You…
- What?

338
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,900
Hit me if you can.

339
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,912
I was pissed off at you a long time.

340
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:04,640
I was slapped by you when we broke up.

341
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,620
It's time to give it back to you.

342
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,240
Ming Yang, Ming Yang!

343
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,480
Stop it, Ming Yang!

344
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,288
I was just changing my clothes. Why is everyone gone?

345
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:20,720
No one waited for me.

346
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,660
No way.

347
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Isn't a single taxi here?

348
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,808
What?

349
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:33,740
Must I wait 50 minutes?

350
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,296
Or should I call Senior Qiao Nan?

351
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,800
Senior Qiao Nan.

352
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,040
Get in the car, Love.

353
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,360
Let me take you for a drink.

354
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,236
I don't know you.

355
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:59,268
You'll know me once you get in my car, right?

356
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:02,892
Older Brother? Do you think I'm a child?

357
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:05,080
I won't go with you.

358
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,600
Don't go, Sweetheart. Let's be friends.

359
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,000
- Don't touch me.
- Take a ride with me.

360
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,120
Can we have a drink and be friends?

361
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,980
Want to take my girlfriend for a ride? Shouldn't I be invited?

362
00:26:51,488 --> 00:26:53,344
Don't get me wrong.

363
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:55,132
Don't overthink it.

364
00:26:56,772 --> 00:26:58,324
Don't look at me.

365
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,928
Senior Qiao Nan! Wait for me.

366
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:09,740
Senior Qiao Nan. Don't go, Senior Qiao Nan.

367
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,940
I've told you many times not to follow me.

368
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,320
All right. If you don't want me to follow you, repeat what you just said.

369
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,768
- Don't follow me.
- Not that.

370
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,020
I've told you many times.

371
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,480
It's what you said to that man just now.

372
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,684
Senior Qiao Nan.

373
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:34,280
Stop following me! I didn't say anything.

374
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,360
- I heard it. You said I'm your girlfriend.
- Fang Mi!

375
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,036
Senior Qiao Nan, thank you.

376
00:28:17,324 --> 00:28:19,720
- Come here.
- I don't need it.

377
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,428
Listen to me.

378
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,592
Come here.

379
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,444
Hurry.

380
00:28:33,824 --> 00:28:35,380
It hurts.

381
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Now you know it hurts.

382
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,580
Why didn't you say anything back then?

383
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,660
I was fighting for you.

384
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,220
He's my ex-boyfriend...

385
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,520
who cheated me out of ¥300,000 ($42,000).

386
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,860
We were even about to marry.

387
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,620
My parents liked him a lot

388
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,880
so they gave me ¥300,000.

389
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,560
That was all their savings.

390
00:29:10,908 --> 00:29:15,140
They wanted us to marry soon and buy a house.

391
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,820
I only found out when we went to see the house

392
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,120
that he was already engaged to another,

393
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,640
and he took all my money.

394
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,700
I didn't beat him enough!

395
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,320
I haven't seen him for a long time,

396
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,420
and I forgot about him.

397
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,580
After that, I haven't dated again.

398
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,700
Not because I don't want to,

399
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,340
but because I'm too scared.

400
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,920
I fear getting hurt again.

401
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,800
And I'm more afraid I will hurt others.

402
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,340
So, Ming Yang, it's not that you're not good enough.

403
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,620
It's because I'm not okay.

404
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,432
I dare not accept you, and I dare not get close to you.

405
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:01,780
I don't want Nuan Nuan to find out.

406
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,452
I don't know how to face you.

407
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,840
Ming Yang, I'm sorry.

408
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,140
It's all my fault.

409
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:15,520
I'm sorry.

412

He already has someone else.

He…
