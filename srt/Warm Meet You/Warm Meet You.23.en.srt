- It's a child.
- Wh-Who does she belong to?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,564
Is she yours?

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Probably yours.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,780
Why are you looking at me?

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,640
She's crying. What should we do?

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
Why are you looking at me? How should I know what to do?

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,580
Th-The child is crying. Shouldn't we hold her?

34
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,884
You hold her.

35
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:41,820
Me?

36
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,540
How would I know how to?

37
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,420
Just try to do it.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,000
Hurry, hurry.

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,360
She stopped crying.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,120
No, no, no. You can't let go.

41
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,040
Don't cry, don't cry.

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,820
Boss, it's an emergency. Please take care of the child for a day.

43
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,436
- I'll pick her up in the evening. Thank you.
- Don't cry, don't fuss.

44
00:03:30,436 --> 00:03:33,000
So what now? Doesn't that mean she will stay here all day?

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,940
What? "All day"?

46
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,200
Brothers, I have work at the studio today so I'll leave first.

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,300
Don't even think of running away. What do we do?

48
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,060
Brother, Brother-in-Law. I'm only 22 years old.

49
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,620
We're not old, either, okay?

50
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,160
Xiao Zhao's baby? She's our shop's regular customer.

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,460
How did she end up here?

52
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,200
Madam.

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,360
Boss, I'll leave her to you then.

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,580
I don't have time to care for her today.

55
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,420
Besides, we can't have a child in the store.

56
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,960
I'll leave her to you three.

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,400
You three are fully responsible.

58
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,280
- Boss.
- Madam.

59
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,892
Oh my.

60
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,240
Don't cry, don't cry.

61
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,840
Mi Mi, are you really leaving?

62
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,600
Didn’t you say many businesses contacted you recently

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,620
asking you to be their endorsement model?

64
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,080
My mom called my grandfather.

65
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,888
She said,

66
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,000
"If you're not happy there, come back early."

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,080
Are you unhappy being with us?

68
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,520
Or is it due to Qiao Nan?

69
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,740
It's not because of him.

70
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,060
I ended things with him a while ago.

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,660
Mi Mi, I know you two had a big fight last time,

72
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,260
but

73
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,740
think from Qiao Nan's perspective.

74
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,780
He was abandoned by his parents when young

75
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,580
and grew up with his grandparents.

76
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,180
It must have been very hard for him.

77
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,380
Also, one who was abandoned before

78
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,420
must really fear getting hurt and being hurt again.

79
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,180
So maybe it’s not that he doesn’t like you.

80
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,740
It's just that he needs more time,

81
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,820
and let him strive to open his heart and get closer to you.

82
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,280
I understand what you're saying,

83
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,800
and I've given him a very long time.

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,600
In the past, I kept constantly trying,

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,800
constantly knocking on his heart's door.

86
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,480
But he kept it tightly shut,

87
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,500
never willing to open for me.

88
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,468
Nuan Nuan, I'm tired.

89
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,360
At times, no matter how hard others try, it's useless.

90
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,160
Only when he's truly willing to open his heart,

91
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,980
real change happens, right?

92
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,780
You also have a point.

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,200
Yi Chen couldn't truly open his heart

94
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,920
so he was unable to change.

95
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,876
Nuan Nuan, President Gu is very nice.

96
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:54,060
I think he really, really cherishes you.

97
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,060
You need to be happy with him, do you understand?

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,220
Nuan Nuan, Mi Mi, they're in trouble.

99
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,360
What happened?

100
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,620
A dessert shop customer left her daughter to them for a day.

101
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,700
But Lady Boss kicked them out to care for the baby.

102
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,800
Now, President Gu, Assistant Sheng, and Ming Yang have taken the child back to President Gu's house.

103
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,580
- What?
- A baby?

104

<i>Cheer up! Cheer up! Cheer up!</i>

109
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,400
What should we do?

110
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,340
I don't know what to do, either.

111
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,000
- What do we do?
- I'm twenty-two.

112
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,820
How about you try carrying her?

113
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,860
Carry her, carry her.

114
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,500
Slowly or she will be uncomfortable.

115
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,580
I haven't even touched her yet.

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,620
Support her neck, or her head will droop.

117
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,780
If you're so capable, you do it.

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
Why is she crying again?

119
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,600
I really don't know about this.

120
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,780
I'm only twenty...

121
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,464
- Hunger.
- What?

122
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:39,380
She must be hungry.

123
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,460
Then I'll go make some formula.

124
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,440
Zhao Ming Yang, you go help, too.

125
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,640
You two, hurry up.

126
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,360
Here it is; here's the milk. Here.

127
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,396
She stopped crying.

128
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,908
She has settled down.

129
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
Could it be?

130
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,680
It should be...

131
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,080
Maybe...

132
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,720
<i>She pooped!</i>

133
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,140
Right! My mom said after you eat, you need the restroom.

134
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,320
We're doomed!

President Zhang, right?

137
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,000
I have an international call to make.

138
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,880
President Zhang, the signal here isn't good.

139
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,320
- I'll take the call outside.
- Wait, Qiao Nan.

140

Brother-in-law, I help people till the end to send Buddha to the west.

141
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,660
I'll leave first. Bye bye.

169
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,860
Why are you looking at me like that?

170
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,140
I think you'll definitely be a great father in the future.

171
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,540
No, what I'm saying is

172
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,140
I just found out today that you are a very attentive,

173
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,140
very patient person.

174
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,036
So in your eyes, what kind of person was I?

175
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,620
Cold, arrogant, uncaring about others,

176
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,980
and giving others no chance to explain.

177
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,940
Do you mean the first interview?

178
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,360
Is that not the case?

179
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
You kicked me out of Z Mobile Games

180
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
and said you'd never hire me in this life.

181
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,300
But aren't you still...

182
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Gu Yi Chen, are you allergic?

183
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,012
"Allergic"?

184
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,540
The baby is a girl!

185
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,640
You've held her all day. Are you allergic?

186
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,700
Did you take allergy medicine?

187
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,208
No.

188
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,120
You're not allergic.

189
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,800
So you're not allergic to girls,

190
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,300
but you're allergic to specific people, right?

191
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,100
"Specific people"?

192
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,560
Like certain people you think may hurt you,

193
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,100
or people you psychologically think

194
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,480
are a threat to you.

195
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,700
You have a negative reaction only to their contact,

196
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,360
which triggers physical or psychological rejection.

197
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:58,012
Yi Chen, as a child, did you experience trauma?

198
00:14:58,012 --> 00:14:59,720
When I was a child?

199
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,100
What happened when your mother died?

200
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,740
<i>- Sister Yuan.
- Mom.</i>

201
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,796
<i>Sister Yuan. Sister Yuan, hang in there.</i>

202
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:18,432
<i>- Mom.
- Sister Yuan, wake up.</i>

203
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:19,836
<i>- Sister Yuan.
- Mom.</i>

204
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,700
<i>- Sister Yuan.
- Don't leave me.</i>

205
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,440
<i>Sister Yuan, I've already called for help!</i>

206
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,460
<i>- Yi Chen. Yi Chen!
- Mom.</i>

207
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,032
<i>Sister Yuan.</i>

208
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,080
<i>- Sister Yuan, wake up.
- Mom.</i>

209
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,760
<i>Mom. Mom.</i>

210
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
<i>Mom.</i>

211
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,280
<i>Mom. Mom.</i>

212
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,660
<i>- Yi Chen. Yi Chen, are you hurt?
- Mom. Mom.</i>

213
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,900
<i>Yi Chen, does it hurt?</i>

214
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,840
<i>Yi Chen, are you hurt anywhere?</i>

215
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,640
<i>Yi Chen. Yi Chen.</i>

216
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,760
<i>Yi Chen.</i>

217
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,180
<i>Yi Chen, I made you your favorite buns.</i>

218
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,440
<i>Try one. Have a taste.</i>

219
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,220
<i>At such a young age, you're so rebellious!</i>

220
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,480
<i>How could you hit a child? Yi Chen.</i>

221
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,080
<i>"Allergy"? "Psychological disease"?</i>

222
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>You're just making trouble!</i>

223
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,396
<i>Come out with me.</i>

224
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,400
So it turned out to be her.

225
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,000
"Her"?

226
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,700
Who is it?

227
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,940
Could it be...

228
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,840
It's your favorite color, which suits you best.

229
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,000
Zheng Lin? Why are you back?

230
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,760
Those old, stubborn guys at the company give me a headache.

231
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,900
They all think I'm old.

232
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,040
If only my son was still by my side.

233
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,940
Zheng Lin, how about...

234
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,540
Don't mention him.

235
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,700
I'm tired. I'll rest for a bit.

236
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,400
Old Chen, bring the car over.

237
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,880
I've missed you.

238
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,140
You don't even know how much happened over these years.

239
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,560
And I have no one else to talk to.

240
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,788
Zheng Lin,

241
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:01,280
I... I...

242
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,060
Today is her birthday.

243
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,120
I want to go see her.

244
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,220
Let's go.

245
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:14,180
Zheng Lin.

246
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,500
It's been so many years. You've already repaid your debt enough.

247
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,680
I'll go with you.

248
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,980
Thank you.

249
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,400
I'm really sorry.

250
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,840
The child's father and I went to file for a divorce today.

251
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,820
So I really couldn't find anyone to take care of her.

252
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,860
Thank you so much, thank you.

253
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,920
No problem.

254
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,140
I hope you can live happily with your baby in the future.

255
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,300
Then I'll get going.

256
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,700
Bye bye.

257
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,380
During family breakups, the ones who hurt are always the children.

258
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,100
I hope when the baby grows up,

259
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,960
she won't be amid the previous generation's grudges.

260
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,740
You're off work this afternoon, right?

261
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,860
Let's go.

262
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,880
Where are we going?

263
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,200
I'll take you to meet my most important person.

264
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,660
Yi Chen, who are you taking me to meet?

265
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,600
You'll know when we get there.

266
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,400
Just tell me first.

267
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Could it be...

268
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,680
My mom.

269
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,120
Y-You should have told me earlier.

270
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,880
At least I should wear formal clothes.

271
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,240
Also, I need to buy a bigger bouquet.

272
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,420
There's no need.

273
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,860
The fact you come with me to see her will make her very happy.

274
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,140
Didn't you always say only opening up fully can change everything?

275
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,620
I don't want to be a freak anymore.

276
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,110
I want to go see her.

277
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,560
I want to say I let go of all the past pain

278
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,580
and live with you as a normal person.

279
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,184
Yi Chen.

280
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,996
Let's go.

281
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,880
Yi Chen, how about we come back later?

282
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,828
Dad.

283
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,040
If you still want to say what you shouldn't, then don't say it.

284
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,320
I don't want to fight with you at your mother's grave.

285
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,156
Dad, I'm sorry.

286
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,780
During the company's anniversary celebration, I lied to you.

287
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,420
I've never recovered from my allergies.

288
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,340
Also, Zhao Nuan Nuan and I are not in a relationship.

289
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:37,244
But I know you forced me to come home, closed down the company,

290
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:41,300
and set me up on blind dates, since you can't let your son go.

291
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,540
When my mom passed away,

292
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,200
I always thought I was hurt deeply.

293
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,720
But I realize you were also hurt.

294
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,340
After my mom passed away,

295
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,392
we were like north and south poles of magnets.

296
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:03,680
Although we still care about each other,

297
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,440
once we get close, we hurt each other.

298
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,220
Perhaps only when we argue, we express our pain to each other.

299
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,020
Dad, Mom died in front of me.

300
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,060
Due to this, I had nightmares for years.

301
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,936
I can't even say how I managed to survive them.

302
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:26,880
But I'll never forget when my stepmother appeared in front of me.

303
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,000
I really didn't mean to deceive you with some sort of allergy.

304
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,660
Maybe I was trapped in the trauma of that time.

305
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,860
I sensed only physical pain

306
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,820
to deal with pain in my heart.

307
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:50,708
Dad, I want to release the past and start over.

308
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,760
Not just for myself,

309
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,100
but also for Nuan Nuan.

310
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,720
When I first united with her, it was to get your investment in our company.

311
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,800
I didn't dream I'd really fall in love with her.

312
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,320
Dad, you didn't expect it, either?

313
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,540
Anyway, everything will pass.

314
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,948
Dad,

315
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm sorry. Let's start over.

316
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,300
Before your mother passed away, she told you that Ling Mei and I betrayed her.

317
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,840
Right?

318
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,760
Actually, she was wrong.

319
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Back then, Ling Mei was just my company's financial officer.

320
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,700
Due to several major projects,

321
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,060
I had to have her by my side for handover,

322
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,600
which caused your mother's misunderstanding.

323
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,940
At that time, your mother was emotionally unstable.

324
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,200
She took antidepressants a long time.

325
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,840
I never dared directly oppose her, fearing to upset her.

326
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:18,360
But I still didn't expect she misunderstood us due to what others said.

327
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,420
Yi Chen, you just said that for years,

328
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,040
you lived with nightmares of your mother's death.

329
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,740
But do you know that my relationship with your aunt, Ling Mei, started

330
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,900
three years after your mother passed away?

331
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,320
Three years later?

332
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,900
And after the tenth anniversary of your mother's death,

333
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,140
we registered our marriage.

334
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,820
Ling Mei never thought of taking your mother's place.

335
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,540
And she has always insisted on not having children.

336
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,640
She said she never wanted your mother to die because of her,

337
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,220
nor did she want you to leave Gu Family due to her.

338
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,400
Ling Mei is not the one who hurt your mother.

339
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,580
Also, she never was the one who hurt you.

340
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,080
All these mistakes

341
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,440
are because of... me.

342
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,160
I hurt your mother

343
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,820
and

344
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,440
everyone else.

345
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,460
Dad.

346
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,220
Let's go.

347
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,000
Sister Yuan, I came to see you again.

348
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,760
How have you been this year?

349
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,220
I've been watching Yi Chen for you.

350
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,740
He's grown up now. He's very impressive and excellent.

351
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,276
Zheng Lin is also doing well.

352
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,040
Everything at home is fine.

353
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,500
Don't worry.

354
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,020
We all miss you very, very much.

355
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,728
Today, I brought you a bouquet of your favorite flowers, and I hope you can be happy.

356
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,600
Yi Chen, I...

357
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:48,520
Auntie,

358
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,524
you've worked hard these years.

359
00:26:54,524 --> 00:26:56,256
You often visit my mom.

360
00:26:56,256 --> 00:27:01,528
From now, on holidays, I'll accompany you and Dad here together.

361
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:05,440
Yi Chen, are you saying...

362
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:08,920
We are a family.

363
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,696
Yes, yes, we are a family.

364
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:15,740
Right, we are a family.

365
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,680
We are a family.

366
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,424
Zheng Lin.

367
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,940
By the way, Yi Chen, come home for dinner.

368
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,120
Come home this weekend.

369
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,864
I'll make the best meal for you and Nuan Nuan.

370
00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:27,600
Bring your girlfriend home with you.

371
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,980
Come home this weekend.

372
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,720

- <i>Yes.</i>

374
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,540
Here, let me help you.

375
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:04,920
Me?

376
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,492
The flowers.

377
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,608
Yes, the flowers.

378
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,000
You give them to Mom.

379
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,112
Mom,

380
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,040
her name is Zhao Nuan Nuan. She's my girlfriend.

381
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:46,036
Although she's not very beautiful, has a bad temper

382
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:49,640
and even bad luck,

383
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:53,888
she is the one I like.

384
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:57,580
Before I met her,

385
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,060
I felt I was taking a long, long detour,

386
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,390
walking in a very deep, dark night.

387
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,640
But luckily, I met her.

388
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,492
She's the beam of light in my life,

389
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:14,928
to save me from endless dark night.

390
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:19,580
Mom, I want to release the past and start over.

391
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,720
You would bless us, too, right?

392
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,790
