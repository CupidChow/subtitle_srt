00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,060
It's that you don't care enough about your brother.

164
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,980
Who says I don't care?

165
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,280
That's because…

166
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,796
That's because someone is distracting me

167
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:27,780
so I lack time and energy to care for others.

168
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,700
What are you talking about?

169
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,160
What I say has nothing to do with you.

170
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:37,500
Don't get too close.

171
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,320
I didn't forgive you yet.

172
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,400
Don't assume since your parents spoke for you,

173
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,640
I will get back with you.

174
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,740
My wounded heart hasn't healed yet.

175
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:01,504
How do I compensate you?

176
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:03,460
Like this

177
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:10,140
or like this?

178
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:20,120
Don't come closer. I don't need your compensation.

179
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,576
I'll give you anything you want.

180
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:47,984
Zhao Nuan Νuan, meeting you is the greatest luck of my life.

181
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,560
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, President Gu.</i>

182
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,640
<i>Hechuan Technology just issued an industry bulletin,</i>

183
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,980
<i>to merge with Z Mobile Games</i>

184
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,780
<i>at the annual industry forum next month.</i>

185
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,560
I see.

186
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,600
What's going on?

187
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,060
Nothing. Hechuan just issued an industry bulletin.

188
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,120
They plan to merge with our Z Mobile Games

189
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,192
at the upcoming annual forum next month.

190
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:39,660
What? Hechuan will acquire Z Mobile Games?

191
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,420
And you can still smile?

192
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,740
All Z Mobile Games' projects are now suspended for inspection.

193
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,432
Someone prepares a takeover

194
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:50,388
so it's a good thing for the company, for Qiao Nan, and for me.

195
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,000
How is this possible?

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,620
You and Qiao Nan spent so much effort in Z Mobile Games.

197
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,800
How can you simply give it away to others?

198
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,060
Especially to Hechuan?

199
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,560
No. It's not just Hechuan, but UA is behind them.

200
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,460
And Luo Yi.

201
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,500
It's Luo Yi, isn't it?

202
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,840
Only Luo Yi wants to steal your company at any cost.

203
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,860
No, I have to find her.

204
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,820
I can't let her touch Z Mobile Games.

205
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,900
I can't let her bully you.

206
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,424
Let's go.

207
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,060
Why are you laughing?

208
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,400
I am laughing because it feels wonderful to be protected.

209
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,472
Everyone spent so much effort in Z Mobile Games.

210
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:35,940
I will never give it away to others.

211
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,080
Nuan Nuan, are you ready?

212
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,520
Let's go back and fight a battle.

213
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,540
Yi Chen, I'm ready.

214
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,300
Then let's go.

215
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,360
- The lines in these areas are very good.
- See this.

216
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,880
This is the decision.

217
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,520
"Meeting You" is our new starting point.

218
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,060
Get it online before Hechuan and UA's "Meeting Romance" has the monopoly.

219
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,740
But Hechuan plagiarized nearly 90% of my project. They took the copyright in advance,

220
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,900
distorted facts and tried to sue me for plagiarism.

221
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,860
If we carry on with "Meeting You," won't we fall into their trap?

222
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,860
Nuan Νuan, this is your project.

223
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,680
Maybe they can steal your ideas and drawings,

224
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,920
but they can never steal your core story or the soul of your dream.

225
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,120
These could never be stolen from the real creator of the mobile game.

226
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,980
I think you will perform better and attract more platform players.

227
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,480
In the past, we avoided similar projects as our competitors,

228
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,520
but this time, since they stole our project,

229
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,220
we need to reclaim our success and reputation.

230
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,520
Qiao Nan, let's start.

231
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,900
What is all this?

232
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,520
These are the new programmers.

233
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,828
Did you really think we had closed these months?

234
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,640
You are really amazing!

235
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,420
They even trained new programmers.

236
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,040
- Of course.
- That's great!

237
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:54,180
Come.

238
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,700
Sir, let me help you.

239
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,660
- You're here? That's good.
- Give it to me.

240
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,050
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

241
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,410
<i>[South Tower]</i>

242
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,440
<i>Everyone is back.</i>

243
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,148
<i>Yi Chen!</i>

244
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,780
Yi Chen, I need to talk to you.

245
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm sorry.

246
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,740
It's inappropriate to talk to my boyfriend alone.

247
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,180
If you want to talk, speak to me.

248
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,180
If not for Yi Chen, you wouldn't qualify to talk to me directly.

249
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,040
If not for Yi Chen, I wouldn't want to talk to you.

250
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,280
Do you know what Z Mobile Games means to Yi Chen?

251
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,040
Then do you know what Z Mobile Games means to Yi Chen?

252
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,280
You—

253
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,700
Yi Chen and Qiao Nan spent so much effort in Z Mobile Games.

254
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,420
No matter what, they won't give away the company.

255
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,260
Although someone uses improper means to steal their project

256
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,780
and grabs all they have while pretending to care.

257
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,160
"Pretending to care"? "Steal"?

258
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,760
Who do you think you are, talking to me about competing in business?

259
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,220
I am unqualified to talk business

260
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,100
because I am just a mobile game developer.

261
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,300
But I love mobile games as Yi Chen does,

262
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,100
and I love our dreams together.

263
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,120
We never blackmail others on the pretext of feelings,

264
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,760
nor do we force others to accept our feelings.

265
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,240
Don't think to lecture me.

266
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,220
When I was with Yi Chen, you were learning to hold a drawing brush in school.

267
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,620
You keep saying your feelings for Yi Chen.

268
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,680
I wonder if you know what liking means or what love is.

269
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,840
Liking someone isn't forcing him,

270
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,500
rather wishing him to be happy, well and safe.

271
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,080
To love someone is not to hurt him,

272
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:33,020
but to do all you can to comfort, understand, and support him.

273
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,720
What have you done for Yi Chen?

274
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,120
You say you like him,

275
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,220
but you want to handcuff him to your side.

276
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,140
You say you love him,

277
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,200
but you attack the company he worked so hard to build.

278
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,800
You want to only steal his happiness away.

279
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,460
So you can control and suffocate him.

280
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,456
Is that called love?

281
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,280
Luo Yi, your feelings toward Yi Chen are not love,

282
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,400
but coercion and obsession.

283
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,020
Stop talking nonsense!

284
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,160
I won't hand him over to you.

285
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,680
I like Gu Yi Chen, and he likes me, too.

286
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,780
We will always be together.

287
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,740
No matter your methods, you can't separate us.

288
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,220
Yi Chen loves me.

289
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,280
- Are you okay?
- What could happen to me?

290
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,308
Did she say something mean to you?

291
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:05,932
I told her the mobile game project is mine.

292
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:09,928
I also said the business operation is mine.

293
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,840
And of course, in the end,

294
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,880
I said Gu Yi Chen

295
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,100
is my love.

296
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,740
I told her that

297
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,060
I will never give up Z Mobile Games, the project, or you,

298
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,060
not even a bit to her.

299
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,040
So starting today, I will work harder on my project.

300
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,200
I must get "Meeting You" online to beat their company.

301
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,820
I won't lose to her,

302
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,260
and I surely won't lose you to her.

303
00:22:49,988 --> 00:22:54,544
Starting today, I will join you to complete "Meeting You."

304
00:22:54,544 --> 00:23:01,360
We will surely get back all we lost before the next Industry Forum conference.

305
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:06,980
Nuan Nuan, your dream will surely come true.

306
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,440
Are you laughing at me?

307
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,800
I wouldn't dare.

308
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,420
Do they really think they can defeat me with these little tricks?

309
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,040
Don't make me laugh.

310
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,800
Coercion? Liking? And love?

311
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,660
They look down on me, UA's vice president.

312
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,360
Let's see if they can revive Z Mobile Games,

313
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,680
that already closed all its projects.

314
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,600
Drive back to the company.

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,520
are finally all complete.

325
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,308
Nuan Nuan.

326
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Mobile Game Industry's Annual Forum.

327
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,576
Next, Luo Yi, Hechuan Technology's Vice President, will give us a brief speech.

328
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,260
Let's welcome her.

329
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,840
Thank you, Chairman.

330
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,260
Thank you to all the media present today.

331
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,300
As Vice President of UA, partner company with Hechuan,

332
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,760
I want to make two important announcements to my colleagues and media friends.

333
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,980
Firstly, Hechuan and UA's female-oriented romance mobile game, "Meeting Romance,"

334
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,076
will go online at midnight tonight.

335
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:19,900
This extremely romantic mobile game is unique.

336
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,980
It also represents the new Chinese female mobile game generation.

337
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,120
Secondly, as everyone knows,

338
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,420
Z Mobile Games faces multiple inspections and will lose its capital chain.

339
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,220
Dedicated to supporting the industry to grow and thrive,

340
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,412
we have fully initiated its acquisition.

341
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:39,996
By midnight, UA will be the largest shareholder of Z Mobile Games,

342
00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:41,940
effective today.

343
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:50,480
I object!

344
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,112
Your acquisition of Z Mobile Games to be its largest shareholder,

345
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:22,380
Vice President Luo, did I agree to this matter?

346
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,480
Z Mobile Games' projects stopped.

347
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,160
Besides UA, what major investor would take over Z Mobile Games?

348
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,160
It seems you clearly understand Z Mobile Games' financial matters.

349
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,060
A month ago, Z Mobile Games submitted all master data

350
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,744
of its mobile game projects to the regulatory center.

351
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:46,440
All Z Mobile Games projects have passed inspection

352
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,768
and re-acquired distribution numbers.

353
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,720
We also investigated the company's internal surveillance,

354
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,620
and found illegal hot linking was initiated by an engineer,

355
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,748
who swapped another's mobile hard drive to frame us.

356
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,010
How does your company's internal affairs involve us?

357
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:19,296
Plagiarism of my project and cybersquatting (stealing) was done by you.

358
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,180
The "Meeting Romance" that Hechuan and UA launch

359
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,040
clearly plagiarizes my independently-created "Meeting You."

360
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,380
Is this a joke?

361
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,020
"Meeting Romance" is a UA project established long ago.

362
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,320
The brand patent was also registered abroad many years ago.

363
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,096
It's clear you plagiarized our creation, yet you want to counter-accuse us?

364
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:44,584
Plagiarizing others' works and registering patents abroad in advance

365
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:50,100
are ways companies like yours damage the domestic mobile game industry.

366
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,644
My project won first place in the industry association's competition three months ago.

367
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:57,800
Unfortunately for you,

368
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,020
"Meeting You" is a project I submitted at college graduation.

369
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,680
The college archives

370
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,100
contain the initial draft of the work I submitted.

371
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,492
My teacher already submitted all documentation to the property court.

372
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:13,480
Plagiarism is always plagiarism.

373
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,720
You can steal my work's shell, but you can never steal its soul.

374
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,500
Gamers who truly love mobile games will verify authenticity by their fingers.

375
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,200
Half an hour ago, "Meeting You" was launched already online.

376
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,360
- It's already online?
- What?

377
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,440
President Gu announced an early start.

378
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,380
The live broadcast will begin.

379
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,200
Three, two, one. Go.

380
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,680
Hello, everyone.

381
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,600
Welcome to our Sweet Channel.

382
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,880
The topic for today's live broadcast is Z Mobile Games' most popular, most awaited,

383
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,700
and most mysterious new online mobile game, "Meeting You."

384
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,300
<i>We also invited the gaming world's most popular voice actor,</i>

385
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,140
Ming God, to broadcast live with me.

386
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,040
I'm sorry. That's all I have to say today.

387
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,796
Give it up.

388
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,140
Just because your project is popular doesn't mean ours won't succeed.

389
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,200
I won't give up our mobile game project.

390
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,400
I obviously won't give up on myself and my business.

391
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,380
Will you still not admit your mistake?

392
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,240
I made no mistake.

393
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,660
<i>Vice President Luo, I've swapped the mobile hard drives</i>

394
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,900
<i>and planted the illegal theft program, as you said.</i>

395
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,260
<i>The news has also spread across the platforms.</i>

396
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,760
<i>I assure you the industry will investigate Z Mobile Games</i>

397
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,140
<i>and fully suspend it for inspection.</i>

398
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,020
I didn't expect you to use such shameless means.

399
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,772
We use means depending on the enemy we face.

400
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:28,392
I presume you know this industry rule better than me.

401
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,720
Even if such an illegal recording exists, so what?

402
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,340
I admit I used unconventional competition.

403
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,360
Will you sue me, President Gu,

404
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,300
and take this weak evidence to court?

405
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:49,540
If the recording is not sufficient, what about these?

406
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,660
Shen Yan, you are from Hechuan.

407
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,000
I have resigned since this morning.

408
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,220
I like doing business with fair competition.

409
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,800
It should always be product performance, not hidden tactics

410
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,040
and illegal methods for market competition.

411
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
I have my principles,

412
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,824
and I have people

413
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,340
I want to protect.

414
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,996
Vice President Luo, on behalf of Z Mobile Games' legal department,

415
00:33:22,996 --> 00:33:27,300
our law firm reported your illegal acts of hiring people

416
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,372
to steal Z Mobile Games' trade secrets,

417
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:33,180
to install viruses, copy programs,

418
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:38,200
and set up hot linking on Z Mobile Games' servers. The relevant industry's department

419
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,060
and Information Security Management all know.

420
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:44,820
We filed lawsuits against you and Hechuan Technology.

421
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,828
Vice President Luo, please cooperate to ensure an immediate investigation.

422
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,260
Luo Yi,

423
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,260
admit your mistake.

424
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,640
My biggest mistake was meeting you back then.

425
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,600
I will forget you, Gu Yi Chen.

426
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,636
Strike a pose.

427
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,170
Okay, let's go.
