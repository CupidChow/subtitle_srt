In collaboration with Hechuan Technology, she directs operations for UA.

These are things only she can do.

Did she send the UA representative to discuss collaboration?

54
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:03,202
After being rejected, she held a grudge

55
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,522
so she not only wants…

56
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,002
But also wants our Z Mobile Games?

Why haven't you told her?

Due to a person like Luo Yi, something can go wrong.

66

That's why I didn't tell Zhao Nuan Nuan.

67
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,182
Luo Yi's target is me.

68

I don't want Nuan Nuan involved.

163
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:39,602
No, listen to me.

164
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:41,202
What else do you want to say?

165
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:43,002
What other tricks will you play?

166
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,342
- No...
- You just attack me!

167
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:47,102
Leave her out of it.

168
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:48,402
How dare you say that?

169
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:49,802
I…

170
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:51,082
No!

171
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,502
Stop! Stop hitting him!

172
00:10:56,402 --> 00:11:01,582
From this day forward, you cannot set foot in the Gu's house.

173
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:05,822
And you… you'd better disappear from Z Mobile Games

174
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:09,322
and this city as soon as possible!

175
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:13,342
I don't want to see you stay around Gu Yi Chen for another minute!

176
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:17,662
I don't want to see either of you two!

177
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:23,282
From this day forward, I, Gu Zheng Lin,

178
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,802
have no son!

179
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:34,686
Are you okay?

180
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:38,646
Nuan Nuan, are you okay?

181
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:40,346
Your face.

182
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:42,882
I'm fine.

183
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:49,482
Nuan Nuan, I'm sorry.

184
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:52,898
No. It's my fault.

185
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:56,922
When Auntie came to see me, I should have told her the truth.

186
00:11:56,922 --> 00:12:00,902
If I gained Auntie's forgiveness at that time,

187
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:05,122
Chairman Gu wouldn't have been so angry now that he's found out.

188
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:07,342
How can this be your fault?

189
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:13,502
What happened between him and me... it would have happened at some point anyway.

190
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:18,182
But how did Chairman Gu know?

191
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:20,462
Exactly what happened?

192
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:28,442
Nuan Nuan, I have to go out on an urgent matter.

193
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:30,562
You must promise me to be careful.

194
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:34,842
Don't listen to anyone who tells you anything, okay?

195
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:39,426
Where are you going?

196
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:43,446
Don't ask. Just trust me.

197
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:35,650
Are you sure all of the processes have passed the test?

198
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,762
<i>Yes.</i>

199
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:38,322
What about the bug? Have you resolved it?

200
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:40,330
<i>It's resolved. </i>

201
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,946
The main program was tested, right?

202
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:43,982
<i>Yes.</i>

203
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:46,042
The time for the temporary shutdown is running out.

204
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,162
After we restart the service,

205
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:49,482
we can't afford to make any mistakes this time.

206
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:50,842
- Do you get it?
<i>- Don't worry.</i>

207
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,442
<i>Everything has been sorted out;</i>

208
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:54,822
<i>no more hot links will appear.</i>

209
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:55,782
Good.

210
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:58,902
Then let's restart the service in 10 minutes.

211
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:01,522
I will call Operations now and let them know.

212
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:03,058
<i>Okay.</i>

213
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:09,182
Operations Center? This is Sheng Qiao Nan.

214
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,174
Assistant Sheng, this is bad!

215
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:12,082
- I have things to do.
- This can't wait.

216
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:14,502
Assistant Sheng, I'm from the legal department.

217
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:17,662
We just received a complaint concerning intellectual property rights from a foreign mobile game company.

218
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:20,142
They complain of copyright infringement from another company.

219
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:22,822
They also report the hot links found on our online project.

220
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:27,562
Now they demand our company must take all projects offline before midnight.

221
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:31,042
Otherwise, they will report us to the relevant authorities and sue us.

222
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:32,782
What did you say?

223
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,902
- Qiao Nan, are you looking for Yi Chen?
- Yes.

224
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,742
I have something very important to discuss with him.

225
00:14:40,742 --> 00:14:41,902
He's not here.

226
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,242
Where did he go?

227
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:45,082
I don't know.

228
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:47,710
- Oh no!
- What's wrong?

229
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,082
Z Mobile Games has a big problem.

230
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:22,602
Director Shen, thank you for personally giving me a ride.

231
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:27,842
Director Shen, you are always the most reassuring.

232
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:30,442
Thanks for your hard work, Director Shen.

233
00:15:59,382 --> 00:16:03,242
I thought you'd never answer a call from me again.

234
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:05,242
Are we going to delay

235
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:07,462
or get straight to the point?

236
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:11,362
You called me here. At least engage in some small talk, right?

237
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:13,362
Are you so eager to end it with me?

238
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:18,682
Did you do what happened to Z Mobile Games' Legend of the Mighty last night?

239
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:21,342
"Legend of the Mighty"?

240
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:23,166
What happened?

241
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:28,862
So you didn't invite me to catch up on old times,

242
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,262
but to interrogate me.

243
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:35,262
Luo Yi, I know you very well.

244
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:39,222
If you really understood me, you wouldn't ask me that.

245
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:43,082
I act quickly on things I want,

246
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:48,422
but some trivial matters are not worth doing myself.

247
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:51,322
All right, you can try to deny it.

248
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,742
How do you explain this?

249
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:57,202
These documents were sent directly to my home.

250
00:16:57,202 --> 00:17:02,462
Except for Qiao Nan, only you know this doctor's email and my home address.

251
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:04,166
Qiao Nan would never betray me.

252
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,286
Besides him, there's only you.

253
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:09,622
How did you get these emails?

254
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:12,922
Did you hack my email or log on to my computer?

255
00:17:12,922 --> 00:17:16,882
I admit that I sent these,

256
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:19,142
but I'm not interested in hacking your email.

257
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:22,502
Your vigilance dropped so much since your return.

258
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:27,962
Did you forget my cousin is a doctor in psychology at the medical school?

259
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:34,402
Dr. S is your cousin?

260
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:36,142
Then the business card Dr. Chen gave me…

261
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:39,422
Yi Chen, I care about you.

262
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:44,482
You were spying on me all this time.

263
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:47,662
You read every letter I sent to the doctor.

264
00:17:47,662 --> 00:17:51,302
My every move, my company, my illness...

265
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,922
- And my—
- Yi Chen.

266
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:54,622
I've told you.

267
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,102
I care a lot about you.

268
00:17:56,102 --> 00:17:58,002
I don't need deceitful caring!

269
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:01,342
Luo Yi, I warn you again! Leave me alone!

270
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:03,482
For your despicable "caring,"

271
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,342
I'd rather have never met you in the first place!

272
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:13,262
Gu Yi Chen, I came back for you!

273
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:16,742
I gave up everything abroad for you!

274
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:18,842
I've come tens of thousands of miles for you.

275
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:23,342
Even though I know you can't be nice to me right now,

276
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:27,082
but Gu Yi Chen, I returned for you.

277
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:28,962
Have you the heart

278
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,382
to leave me like before?

279
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:37,042
Can you bear to leave me for three years

280
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,002
and another three years?

281
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:48,082
<i>Senior, have you seen Gu Yi Chen?</i>

282
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:50,222
- <i>He's gone.
- "Gone"?</i>

283
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:52,602
<i>Where did he go? Did he go home or back to school?</i>

284
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:54,266
<i>He transferred schools.</i>

285
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,282
<i>- "Transferred schools"?
- Didn't he tell you?</i>

286
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:58,302
<i>He transferred from our school to the Polytechnic Institute.</i>

287
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:00,682
<i>They say he won't be back for three years.</i>

288
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,402
<i>"Three years"?</i>

289
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:03,682
<i>What about after three years?</i>

290
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:05,102
<i>Who knows?</i>

291
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:09,162
<i>You're close to him; he wouldn't leave without telling you.</i>

292
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:11,622
<i>Aren't you two dating?</i>

293
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:14,222
<i>That's very cruel.</i>

294
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:23,734
After you left, I've waited for you day after day.

295
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:27,922
I found your former professor and pestered him for your address.

296
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:30,842
The professor wouldn't tell me no matter what I did

297
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,962
so I went all over the world looking for you.

298
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:36,362
I wrote to every Polytechnic Institute in the United States.

299
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:39,382
I called every Polytechnic Institute student union.

300
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:43,582
Do you have any idea how it feels to be disappointed

301
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,962
for 365 days?

302
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:49,662
Do you know how I felt when I searched Internet again and again

303
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:51,882
for all news related to you?

304
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:55,082
I registered your name on all my social media,

305
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:59,822
just so you could find me online.

306
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,914
Luo Yi...

307
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:11,462
You don't know how I hurt when you left without a goodbye.

308
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:14,802
Now I've finally found you.

309
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:17,702
Will you still treat me like you used to?

310
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:20,622
Will you hurt me again?

311
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,522
Shen Yan, I'm here.

312
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,902
<i>Are you sure Yi Chen is inside?</i>

313
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:34,762
<i>He has an appointment with your deputy manager.</i>

314
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:37,362
Who is your deputy manager?

315
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,562
Go in, and you'll see her.

316
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:42,002
Go in?

317
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:43,922
<i>Aren't you coming?</i>

318
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,930
<i>Okay then.</i>

319
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,438
Yi Chen.

320
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:02,542
I don't care about anything.

321
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:06,502
Mobile games, the industry, the company, I don't care about that.

322
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:08,642
I only care about

323

Don't come any closer!

329
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:23,342
Nuan Nuan, it's me.

330
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,322
Don't come closer!

331

332

I won't get angry or misunderstand you.

333
00:22:31,942 --> 00:22:35,082
Just tell me, who is she?

334
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,982
- She... she is…
- Your ex-girlfriend?

335
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,822
No. She was my junior when I studied abroad.

336
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:44,602
As she was born abroad, her personality is more open.

337
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:48,422
We were in the same lab at school, and she liked to follow me.

338
00:22:48,422 --> 00:22:51,282
- But...
- Did she confess to you?

339
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,402
She likes you?

340
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:54,966
Nuan Nuan.

341
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:59,002
She returned from the United States for you.

342
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:04,802
She joined Hechuan as the company's deputy manager for you, right?

343
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:06,654
How do you know that?

344
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:13,002
Yi Chen, why did you keep this from me?

345
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,122
You knew she was back.

346
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:18,202
You've seen her before.

347
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:19,322
Why?

348
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:22,442
Why didn't you tell me?

349
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:30,022
Just now, I saw

350
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:32,202
her hugging you.

351
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:34,922
I don't believe…

352
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:37,822
I don't believe there's nothing between you two.

353
00:23:37,822 --> 00:23:40,002
She came back for you.

354
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,466
- And she is still in your heart.
- No way!

355
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:46,082
Then why can she hug you?

356
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:53,102
Gu Yi Chen, even I wasn't allowed to touch you.

357
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:54,442
Why?

358
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:57,942
Why didn't you push her away when she hugged you?

Nuan Nuan.

361
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:06,202
All that happened today, from the company's invasive program,

362
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:08,842
to the fight between you and Chairman Gu,

363
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:12,882
and just now, I saw you with her.

364
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,142
All of that makes me really upset.

365
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:21,182
I can no longer go to Z Mobile Games.

366
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:23,182
I don't dare see the Chairman anymore,

367
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:26,582
and I don't know how to face you anymore.

368
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:28,246
Nuan Nuan.

369

Gu Yi Chen.

371
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:47,942
- Let's...
- No.

372
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:50,062
- Nuan Nuan.
- Break up.

373
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:52,722
No, no.

374
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:53,922
No way.

375
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:55,882
Why should we break up?

376
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,402
Why do we have to break up?

377
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:01,382
I know issues at the company are not your fault.

378
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:02,802
I'll make sure I resolve it!

You finally woke up. I almost had to take you to the hospital again.

388
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,322
What exactly happened back there?

389
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:09,522
I have to go out.

390
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:11,402
You're in this state; where can you go?

391

392

Why?

398
00:26:42,442 --> 00:26:46,902
I met with Luo Yi; she saw it.

399
00:26:47,802 --> 00:26:50,282
About Luo Yi, you couldn't keep that from Nuan Nuan.

400
00:26:50,282 --> 00:26:54,642
Now she's seen it, she will surely think you faked all your symptoms.

401
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:59,614

but also my dad.
