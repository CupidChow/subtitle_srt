- Here!

33
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,560
What are you doing again?

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,840
Sleepy all the time,

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,080
always late, and no energy when you're at work.

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,380
Can I still rely on you for my dessert shop?

37
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,920
Boss, I promise I won't doze off today.

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,440
I promise to work hard. I can definitely achieve today's sales target.

39
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,540
Rely on you?

40
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,960
My dessert shop would have gone bankrupt 800 times!

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,340
Boss...

42
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,720
So for the shop's glorious future,

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,060
I've decided to add new strength.

44
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,040
Gu... Gu… Gu…

45
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,300
From today, he will work with you as a waiter in our shop.

46
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,940
As a senior, you should take good care of your junior.

47
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,660
Guide him and teach him.

48
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,020
Provide quality service to our customers together.

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,500
Him?

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,300
"Senior"?

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,980
"Junior"?

52
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,520
No, Boss, no.

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,920
What will work or not?

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,520
If I say yes, it's yes.

55
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,920
Gu Yi Chen, come on. Meet the senior.

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,376
Senior.

57
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,120
Gu Yi Chen, are you crazy?

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,280
Reporting, Senior, I'm not.

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,080
Y-You're really calling me "Senior"?

60
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Or should I call you

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,188
Teacher Zhao?

62
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,380
Someone is actually willing to work for me and even pay me for it.

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,580
If there are more good things like this, please give me ten more!

64
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,220
Stop playing around.

65
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,080
You're the president of Z Mobile Games.

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,020
How can you work here?

67
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,820
I'm not now. I've signed the consignment (on behalf) agreement.

68
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,400
Now the president of Z Mobile Games is Qiao Nan.

69
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,460
I'm like you, just a normal worker.

70
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,760
Can you tell me what to do next?

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,380
This is a dessert shop.

72
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,140
What's wrong with a dessert shop?

73
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,780
Every day, all kinds of people come and go.

74
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,080
Can you handle it?

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,040
What about your allergies?

76
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,260
Don't you fear accidents?

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,700
No.

78
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,380
With you by my side, I fear nothing.

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,500
Did I just see him smile at someone?

80
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,400
He can actually initiate a smile at others?

81
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,680
A girl too?

82
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,760
Please come in.

83
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,700
President Sheng, this is the mail received today.

84
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,020
I've already examined it.

85
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,560
Two partners sent termination agreements,

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,140
and a bill collection notice came.

87
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,528
Put them there.

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,240
Thanks for your hard work.

89
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,440
Everyone is off work, but you stayed to help.

90
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,480
I've been in the company many years.

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,100
Sharing its joys and sorrows is what I should do.

92
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,460
Moreover, I believe the company

93
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,080
won't decline this quickly.

94
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,100
Just like life, there are ups and downs.

95
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,000
I trust President Gu. I trust you.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I trust Nuan Nuan and Mi.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,320
I trust everyone.

98
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,680
It's no surprise you became such good friends with Nuan Nuan and others.

99
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,840
They really chose the right person.

100
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Since you stayed, then come and help me.

101
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,880
President Gu left much unfinished work.

102
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,440
I remember your coordination ability is quite good.

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,500
If you stay and help me, it would make me feel better.

104
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,216
Okay.

105
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,300
Have you recently…

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,048
Nothing.

107
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,440
Do you want to ask about Mi?

108
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,060
She hasn't left yet.

109
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,820
During the last Digital Expo roadshow,

110
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,144
she was photographed by many media outlets, and the response was very good.

111
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:09,120
Several media outlets have invited her to be a print ad model.

112
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,060
She's still considering it.

113
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,660
Really?

114
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,120
Haven't you guys been in touch lately?

115
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,540
Mr. Sheng, I'm not a person who likes to talk too much.

116
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,000
But I didn't say much about the matter between President Gu and Nuan Nuan.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,080
You and Mi Mi…

118
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,180
Mi Mi is a good girl.

119
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,428
I know.

120
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:42,060
Apart from her being a good girl,

121
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,580
she really, really loves you.

122
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,160
Don't miss out on her.

123
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,920
Otherwise, it will really become your life regret.

124
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,420
<i>[I like you!]</i>

125
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,740
Gu Yi Chen, are you serious?

126
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,540
What?

127
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,980
Stop playing around.

128
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,000
Leave here and leave my home.

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Now!

130
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,860
I've told you I'm serious. I won't leave.

131
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,020
Gu Yi Chen!

132
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,820
There's still three-fifths of today's sales target to be met.

133
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,860
Whichever one of you two, within the next six hours,

134
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,300
can complete the rest of the target

135
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,560
gets to stay in my shop.

136
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,400
Boss!

137
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,080
I mean what I say.

138
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,740
Whoever does poorly doesn't need to come tomorrow.

139
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,660
Nuan Nuan, you've tried to push me away.

140
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,500
If you don't step up, you can't come tomorrow, either.

141
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,460
Don't miss out as you pass by!

142
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,600
Happy Dessert Shop. Happiness in the dessert shop.

143
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,160
Coffee is 10% off. Desserts are 30% off.

144
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,040
Happy set meal is half price!

145
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,848
Let me see. Thank you.

146

151

I want this one, this one.

00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,160
- I'm going crazy, crazy.
- I'll have one, too. I want one.

165
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,608
- Gu Yi Chen.
- Is this delicious? I want this one.

166
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,540
Are you crazy, or am I crazy?

167
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,780
Everyone, listen! I've booked the whole place today!

168
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,220
It's me who is crazy!

169
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,540
So generous.

170
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,540
Amazing.

171
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,960
What on Earth is he doing?

172
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,600
Insisting on working here.

173
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,900
Are you really a worker?

174
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,880
You can't even touch girls.

175
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,060
Gu Yi Chen, you're really stubborn.

176
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,680
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

177
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,560
Sorry, sorry!

178
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,700
I didn't do it on purpose. Are you okay?

179
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,312
Are you burned?

180
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:43,640
I'm really sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

181
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm sorry; I'm sorry.

182
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:51,480
- Yi Chen.
- It's okay.

183
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,948
I'm really sorry.

184
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:56,260
Yi Chen, are you okay?

185
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,276
Yi Chen?

186
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,680
Yi Chen.

187
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,080
Yi Chen, are you all right?

188
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,196
Yi Chen!

189
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,708
Gu Yi Chen!

190
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,364
Gu Yi Chen!

191
00:13:55,364 --> 00:13:57,560
Are you okay? Gu Yi Chen?

192
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,260
Gu Yi Chen.

193
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,472
Yi Chen.

194
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,880
Yi Chen!

195
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,080
Gu Yi Chen! Gu Yi Chen!

196
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,600
Mom, what's wrong?

197
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,980
I twisted my hip.

198
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,560
Slow down, slowly. Go sit over there.

199
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,840
Slowly.

200
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,580
Are you okay, Mom?

201
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,980
How is it?

202
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,880
It's okay; I just need rest. It will be fine soon.

203
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,920
Let me massage it for you.

204
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,280
It's okay, it's okay. This old hip is aging.

205
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,580
Don't say that, Mom.

206
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,920
- What's wrong?
- Hip sprain.

207
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,620
- I strained an old injury.
- Then take good care of your mom.

208
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,500
I'll go carry the box upstairs.

209
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,432
- Is it here, Mom?
- I'm fine now.

210
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,820
- Have you finished your homework?
- Yes, Mom.

211
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,320
Mom, be careful.

212
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,480
- All right.
- Come.

213
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,340
- Slowly, carefully.
- It's all right.

214
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,088
Don't worry.

215
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:43,400
- Slow down, Mom.
- I'm fine.

216
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,300
Senior Qiao Nan.

217
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,220
You don't have to sympathize with me.

218
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,428
I'm fine.

219
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,900
Even if I've been alone so many years,

220
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,628
I'm still fine.

221
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,520
Forgive yourself!

222
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,400
Stop saying you don't care.

223
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,060
I know you care more than anyone else.

224
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,580
Although your mom hurt you,

225
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,800
even though you always say you don't want others' concern,

226
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,420
or care about kinship,

227
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,640
but Senior Qiao Nan, I know you want kinship and family like anyone else!

228
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,680
- You especially care if others love you!
- Stop talking!

229
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,660
Senior Qiao Nan!

230
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,720
Stop trapping yourself in a cage.

231
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,400
Those who left went far away.

232
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,560
Only you are stuck in the same place.

233
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,000
Forgive yourself.

234
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,080
Let go of tangles in your heart.

235
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,160
Your mom is doing well now.

236
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,340
If you truly love her,

237
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,120
you surely don't want her to be as pained as before.

238
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,660
She now leads a very happy life.

239
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,000
In your heart, you bless her too, right?

240
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,196
But Senior Qiao Nan,

241
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,320
I just hope for your happiness.

242
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,020
I…

243
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,848
Senior Qiao Nan,

244
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,172
I like you.

245
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,800
This is the ninety-ninth time

246
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
I am confessing.

247
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,580
Maybe,

248
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,220
it is also

249
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,300
the last time.

250
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,000
Xin Ran, why are you so late today? Are you tired?

251
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,620
What do you want to eat tonight?

252
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,276
Steak, ribs, or braised pork?

253
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:03,860
How about fish? I know you love boiled fish the most.

254
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,040
I'll go buy it for you now.

255
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,372
Zhao Ming Yang, we don't need to evade the issue anymore.

256
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:13,980
Today, let's clear everything up.

257
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,800
Wh-What do you want to say?

258
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,180
Ming Yang, you should go.

259
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,900
"Go"? I work at the studio tonight; I can't…

260
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,060
Move from our home and from my side.

261
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,120
- Why?
- What do you mean "why"?

262
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,540
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

263
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,720
For what reason?

264
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,760
Why are you driving me away?

265
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,340
Why can't we see each other anymore?

266
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,540
Did I do something wrong again?

267
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,060
Is it for breaking a few of your lipsticks?

268
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,560
Say it: how much money; how many? I can compensate all.

269
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,880
Zhao Ming Yang.

270
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,240
Is this about lipstick?

271
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,092
It's because

272
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
we are not suitable.

273
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,340
Is it because I am Zhao Nuan Nuan's little brother?

274
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,300
Is it because you are Zhao Nuan Nuan's best friend?

275
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,612
Or is it because I'm three years younger than you, or because…

276
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:02,360
It's because I don't like you.

277
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,100
I don't like dating younger people,

278
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,420
especially not my bestie's little brother.

279
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,800
I don't want to date anyone.

280
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,260
I don't want to date you.

281
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,340
Does this answer satisfy you?

282
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,680

299
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,480
Yi Chen, take a deep breath.

300
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,020
Relax, I'm here.

301
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,620
It's okay.

302
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,148
I'm fine.

303
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,680
I told you before

304
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,240
not to stay here!

305
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,600
Why won't you listen?

306
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,760
Do you have to get hurt to stop?

307
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,000
Nuan Nuan, don't leave me!

308
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,556
Nuan Nuan,

309
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,640
don't leave me.

310
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,260
You said you would always be by my side, always with me.

311
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,900
I have no feelings for Luo Yi.

312
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,140
She was just my college junior.

313
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,500
We were in the same lab so we met each other.

314
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,060
I have only a friendship with her,

315
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,500
and due to my allergies, I didn't have contact with her.

316
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,620
I know she likes me, but I feel nothing for her

317
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,540
so I changed schools halfway through my studies.

318
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,360
I didn't know she searched for me and followed me to China.

319
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,324
Nuan Nuan, I admit I hid Luo Yi's existence from you

320
00:23:52,324 --> 00:23:55,360
since I know her fierce personality.

321
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,740
I didn't want you to get hurt.

322
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,700
My sudden departure back then affected her.

323
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,720
I feel guilty toward her

324
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,600
so at the coffee shop that day, I…

325
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,600
But I never liked her.

326
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,340
The one I like

327
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,680
is you only.

328
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,760
Don't say these words.

329
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,600
That day, I saw you hugging her.

330
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,940
I was jealous.

331
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,300
I was very angry,

332
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,420
but after calming down, I realized.

333
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,880
I know you wouldn't lie to me,

334
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,840
nor would you casually hug a girl,

335
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,284
but we…

336
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,800
It's not just about liking each other.

337
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,800
Nuan Nuan.

338
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,912
Now, what about the company?

339
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:50,448
What about the project?

340
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:54,840
On the day I left, Z Mobile Games' reputation plummeted due to online outage.

341
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,600
Hechuan Technology's mobile game is 90% like my project.

342
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,580
They seized first place in the female mobile game market.

343
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,460
Sheng Qiao Nan said Hechuan sues me for plagiarism.

344
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,340
Not only the project,

345
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,240
but also your family.

346
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,240
If Chairman is upset we've deceived him for so long,

347
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,180
he won't forgive me in his lifetime.

348
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,740
Nuan Nuan.

349
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,500
How can we be together?

350
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,620
Yi Chen, how can we be a couple?

351
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,560
We will surely be together, no matter the obstacles.

352
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,100
We won't separate.

353
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,280
Never.

354
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,808
Gu Yi Chen.

355
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,144
Nuan Nuan.

356
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:49,520
Did you forget about our childhood?

357
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,040
"Childhood"?

358
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,200
<i>Yi Chen, I made you your favorite buns.</i>

359
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,760
<i>Try one.</i>

360
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,580
<i>Have a taste.</i>

361
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,880
<i>At such a young age, you're so rebellious!</i>

362
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,620
<i>How could you hit a child? Yi Chen.</i>

363
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,420
<i>"Allergy"? "Psychological disease"?</i>

364
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,860
<i>You're just making trouble!</i>

365
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,720
<i>Come out with me.</i>

366
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:29,436
<i>Such a small child. "Allergy"?</i>

367
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,460
<i>How can you hit a child?</i>

368
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,884
<i>Brother, Brother.</i>

369
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,940
<i>Brother, does it hurt?</i>

370
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,800
<i>I'll rub it for you. It won't hurt after.</i>

371
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,520
<i>Little Brother, don't cry.</i>

372
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,380
<i>If you endure, it won't hurt.</i>

373
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,220
<i>Here, this is for you.</i>

374
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,880
So that little boy was you.

375
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,400
It was me.

376
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,360
When we were young, you comforted me.

377
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,840
Now it's my turn to protect you.

378
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,360
You don't have to worry.

379
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,820
I will investigate the company's issues fully.

380
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,140
Hechuan Technology stole your project.

381
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,764
I will take it back one by one.

382
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,460
As for my family,

383
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,680
leave it all to me.

384
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:49,416
Please forgive me and come back to me.

385
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,050
Pika, pika, pika chu!

386
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,816
Nuan Nuan.

387
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,364
Nuan Nuan!

Boss, a warmhearted cappuccino.

402
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,960
My brother-in-law, did you open?

403
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,380
A warmhearted "Cinocappu."

404
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,440
"Cappuccino"? "Cinocappu"?

405
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,280
The chef is not even at work yet.

406
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,800
You two are even earlier than the alarm clock.

What's the matter?

408
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,320
Someone said

409
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,380
she may not like me anymore.

410
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,300
Someone said she doesn't like me at all.

411
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,600
Isn't that good?

412
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,072
Congratulate them for leaving the bitter sea (endless suffering).

413
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:25,140
Boss, you're too unrighteous.

414
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,060
You can't mock us since you're with Nuan Nuan.

415
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,400
Brother-in-law, you can't monopolize my sister

416
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,020
and laugh at us, the eternal bachelors.

417
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,620
I'm not mocking you.

418
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,620
I'm disgusted with you.

419
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,580
Gu Yi Chen, don't you want to live?

420
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,220
Gu Yi Chen, come here.

421
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,884
Nuan Nuan.

422
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,720
Zhao Nuan Nuan, where are you going?

423
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,820
I have a headache.

424
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,140
Stomachache, backache, numb legs, cramps.

425
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,300
Boss, I'll take today off. Bye bye!

426
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,840
Gu Yi Chen, are these two your friends?

427
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,540
Did you have breakfast?

428
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,400
Would you like a sweet hot bread?

429
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,116
Okay.

430
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,920
What's that noise?

431
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,376
What noise?

432
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:29,580
There is a sound like crying.

433
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,800
It's a child's cry.

434
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,160
A child?

435
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,640
Whose child?
