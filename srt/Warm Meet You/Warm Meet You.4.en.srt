27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,852
Zhao Nuan Nuan is so messy.

28
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:01,760
I didn't expect her roommate to be even messier.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,480
Mom always wants to arrange blind dates for her.

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,668
With them like this, it's rare if they find husbands.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,940
Zhao Nuan Nuan, how could you?

32
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:57,692
Who is that?

33
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,700
Who? Who's in there?

34
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,560
Who is it? Exactly who is there?

35
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,360
Come out! Show yourself!

36
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,880
I'm going to hurt you.

37
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:45,828
If you don't come out,

38
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,160
I will really hurt you!

39
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,680
So it's you, Little Cat.

40
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,240
This really is too much.

41
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,120
I have to do this at Zhao Nuan Nuan's home.

42
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,480
What kind of punishment am I suffering?

43
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,180
No. I must get my studio done tomorrow.

44
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,740
I need to move. Move out.

45
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,420
Older Auntie, no, I mean Older Sister. It's not what you think.

46
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,980
Listen to me, Baby.

47
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,540
In the future, we mustn't play with the weird guy next door.

48
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,320
You're the weird one!

49
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,720
Hello, how can I help you?

50
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,900
I'm looking for Wu Xin Ran.

51
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,140
Xin Ran is off today. She seems to have gone home.

52
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,000
If you need to reach her, I can pass a message for you.

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,280
- What? Has she gone home?
- Yes.

54
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,040
That's bad. I wonder if Zhao Ming Yang is there or not.

55
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:45,312
- Zhao Nuan Nuan.
- Yes?

56
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:48,200
President Gu is waiting for you upstairs. Why aren't you going up?

57
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,440
- But...
- But what?

58
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,920
It's almost 3 p.m. Do you want to double the work?

59
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,652
Quickly, come with me.

60
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:58,100
Assistant Sheng, wait for me.

<i>[Office of the President]</i>

62
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,140
What are you waiting for? Go in.

63
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,280
G-Gu Yi…

64
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,916
President Gu, I'm here.

65
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:45,836
It's not 3 p.m. yet.

66
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:47,916
That's an improvement.

67
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,908
So my work is…

68
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:52,664
It's over there.

69
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,660
Will I work as a cleaner at Z Mobile Games?

70
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,260
To be precise, you will be an exclusive cleaner for my office.

71
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,960
It doesn't seem much different from a regular company cleaner.

72
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,840
The difference is huge.

73
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,700
You must sort the books according to the size, thickness,

74
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,640
category, and purchase year, and neatly put them in their place.

75
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,240
Also, pay attention to the color of the book covers and align them by color scheme.

76
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,680
For the sofas and coffee table, including the decorations and tea cups,

77
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,480
you need to wash them with very hot water daily.

78
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Sanitize with the best disinfectant wipes.

79
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,380
Don't leave a single water stain on them.

80
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,700
When cleaning the office desk, besides daily cleaning and maintenance,

81
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,720
you must put all files back where they were.

82
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,660
If a file is lost or a single page goes missing,

83
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,820
you must take full responsibility.

84
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Also, for the cleaning of the entire office,

85
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,900
besides the daily large-scale disinfection,

86
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,000
there's also a more thorough cleaning every three days.

87
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,080
Even the smallest corners of all sofas, carpets, and file cabinets

88
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,300
must all be cleaned until they are dust-free.

89
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,840
If I find a strand of hair

90
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,548
or a speck of dust,

91
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,620
you'll have to do it all over again.

92
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,440
Gu Yi Chen, you might as well kill me!

But for Senior Nan,

96
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,336

97

Have you sent out all the administrative files today?

98
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,224
What are you doing? The packages are piling up.

99
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:23,012
Aren't you working today?

100
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:27,056
Oh... Xin Ran sent out all administrative files in the morning.

101
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:32,184
If you're in a hurry, we can send them for you first thing tomorrow. We—

102
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:35,040
No, these are all project copyright books.

103
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,160
They need to be expedited.

104
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,220
Forget it; I'll go myself.

105
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,760
Won't you stand up?

106
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,820
Do I have to personally pull you out,

108
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,580
Surprise, Senior Nan.

<i>[President Gu Yi Chen]</i>

110
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:38,540
I thought he called me back to Z Mobile Games out of real kindness

111
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,780
to give me a job as a concept artist.

112
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,820
I can't believe he is such a profiteer.

113
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,640
He called me back to torment me, right?

114
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:51,772
Thorough disinfection of the office?

115
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:54,960
He might as well soak himself in disinfectant.

116
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,292
If I keep working like this every day,

117
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:03,660
I'm afraid I'll die here before I reach 100 days in this office.

118
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:13,480
Wait. Since I met him at the hotel last time,

119
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,100
many good things have happened to me.

120
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,620
Now that I'm trapped in this office,

121
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,560
isn't it my perfect chance to get close to him

122
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,116
and change my life of almost 22 years of bad luck?

123
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:30,680
Maybe he really is like a lucky charm

124
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,140
and touching him could change my life.

125
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:41,900
The most awesome mobile game master in the industry, right?

126
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,800
Then let me…

127
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,020
I can't live this way anymore.

128
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,800
Even if I can't afford rent, must I hide?

129
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm leaving right now.

130
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,920
U-Unbelievable.

131
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,180
It can't be that she has come back again?

132
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,580
Since we're roommates,

133
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,300
let me help you

134
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,340
expel the evil.

135
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,736
Chili, garlic, and vinegar?

136

Zhao Nuan Nuan!

137
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:06,180
- Qiao Nan…
- What did you call me?

138
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,840
Senior Nan.

139
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,508
What's going on?

140
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:13,960
Why did you suddenly return from America? Did you tell your parents?

141
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,120
How is it you've appeared at Z Mobile Games, even working as a receptionist?

142
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,712
Exactly what are you doing?

143
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,880
You're asking me so many questions. Which one should I answer first?

144
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,360
I just returned from America last week.

145
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,960
My parents don't know. I came back just for you.

146
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,220
I want to work at Z Mobile Games so I can be by your side.

147
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,800
I don't mind receptionist work.

148
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,880
As long as I can see you every day, I can do anything.

149
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
Stop playing around.

150
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,640
You rushed back without telling your parents?

151
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,112
They must be looking all over the world for you now!

152
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:49,092
What are you doing as a receptionist? It makes no sense.

153
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:52,080
Pack your bags right away and go back tomorrow.

154
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,296
No. Leave today. I'll book a ticket for you right now.

155
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:56,720
Don't drive me away.

156
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,492
Impossible.

157
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,300
Hello, book a flight to America for today.

158
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,920
- I won't go!
- This afternoon, as soon as possible.

159
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,328
I like you!

160
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,100
If there are no other questions, today's meeting can end right now.

President Gu.

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,100
Qiao Nan, the leader of Fei Xiang Investment contacted me today.

He wants to join our marketing operations.

I'm going out; come pick me up.

What do you want?

172
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,968
Nothing.

173
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:18,080
I just want to

174
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,400
borrow something from you, President Gu.

The moon is quite full tonight, right?

185
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,620
Yes, besides the moon, you can see Saturn.

- What's that one next to it?
- That next one?

It's Venus, twinkling and sparkling.

I just wanted to touch the lucky charm for some good luck.

191
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,040
Why did I have to meet everyone getting off work?

192
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,660
You even managed to corner him.

193

Zhao Nuan Nuan, you're incurable.

What? Again?

204
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,480
I'm only 22.

205
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,576
I won't go on a blind date.

206
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:24,888
Why aren't you driving?

207
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:28,420
Where are we going? I haven't had time to prepare.

208

Qiao Nan, whenever you lie, your eyes look right.

What about you, CEO Gu?

212
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,320
I just saw in the work group chat that you put on quite a show in the elevator.

213
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,640
Assistant Sheng, you just lost your performance bonus for this month.

214
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,120
Fine with me. After all, you're the one supporting me.

215
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,964
Enough of that. Let's get to business.

216
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:05,580
At Times Square, I'll meet the person in charge of Fei Xiang.

217
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,580
He seems very interested in our big data operation ideas for "Legend II."

218
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,220
I'll talk with him first. You can go back and sort out the data tonight.

219
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:18,540
If we can secure this investment, the marketing operations for our sequel will be stable.

220
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,920
All right, I'll get it ready as soon as I get home.

221
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,320
How have Hechuan Technology and UA been doing recently?

222
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,120
As you expected, those two companies initiated contacts.

223
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,320
From insider information, Hechuan has made many concessions to UA's demands.

224
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,540
I fear they probably want to reach an agreement no matter what.

225
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,740
If these two companies agree to collaborate, we will be their next target.

226
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,584
- Proceed as planned.
- Absolutely.

227
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
Mom, can't you just leave me alone?

228
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,888
Zhao Nuan Nuan, what's wrong with you?

229
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:54,560
<i>Can't you understand my good intentions?</i>

230
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,220
<i>Nuan Nuan, we know you are only 22.</i>

231
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,840
<i>We're not in a hurry to marry you off,</i>

232
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,460
but it's dangerous for a young girl like you to be out there alone

233
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,548
with no one taking care of you. Isn't that right?

234
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:10,960
<i>We just want you to find a good boyfriend soon.</i>

235
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,976
Even if he just brings you a meal when you're working overtime,

236
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:19,580
or gives you advice when you need it, we'll feel at ease.

237
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,020
<i>Besides, if you start blind dates at 22,</i>

238
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,816
<i>then you have to date for two years.</i>

239
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:28,580
One more year after you're engaged,

240
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,660
and buying a home, decorating it, buying furniture and other assets,

241
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,960
and preparing for the wedding will take another year, right?

242
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
<i>By then, you won't be 22 anymore.</i>

243
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,740
Mom, why are you thinking so far ahead?

244
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,200
<i>We, as parents, have to think ahead, right?</i>

245
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,120
Why aren't you asking Ming Yang to go on blind dates?

246
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,220
<i>I'll deal with that brat after I marry you off.</i>

247
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,052
I am only one minute older than him.

248
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:55,840
<i>All right, enough.</i>

249
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
I'll go, okay?

250
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,220
<i>That's more like it.</i>

251
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,736
That's my good girl.

252
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,360
Wait, I'll send you the address of the blind date.

253
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,436
Check it out.

254
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,480
I should have promoted Ming Yang

255
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,960
and let Mom focus on him.

256
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,420
Never mind. We'll wait and see.

257
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,920
Why your look?

258
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,100
I'm just concerned about our Nuan Nuan.

259
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,080
Children can find their own destiny.

260
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,520
What do you know?

261
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,880
If we wait for Nuan Nuan to take initiative,

262
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,320
all the good young men will be taken.

263
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,080
I'm just taking precautions, understand?

264
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,976
I don't understand.

265
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:46,712
Add water.

266
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,080
Okay, I will add it for you.

267
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,320
Boss, something happened.

268
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,160
Hechuan Technology just held a press conference,

269
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,680
to announce a cooperation agreement with UA.

270
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,240
More than ten investment company leaders

271
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,720
were directly invited to the press conference site.

272
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:49,660
- I see.
- What do we do now?

273
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,252
First, let's go back to the company.

274
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,960
Excuse me, where is room 208?

275
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,632
Over there.

276
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,980
By the way, which way is the restroom?

277
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,784
This way.

278
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,140
If you don't have anything to say, I'll leave now.

279
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,900
You failed to win the investment.

280
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,020
You didn't know you were facing your enemy's company.

281
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,660
With your business intellect,

282
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,936
don't tell anyone that you're my son when you leave here.

283
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,976
I don't want to be judged by my family name.

284
00:24:52,976 --> 00:24:55,540
Cooperation depends not only on chance, but on strength.

285
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,796
I believe in my company.

The Haitian Convalescence Home.,

288
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:06,580
You will handle the second phase of its development.

289
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,920
The group has many projects this year and can't spare any manpower.

290
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,148
You finish this project,

291
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:18,780
and all large, profitable items can be transferred to your company's name.

292
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,740
You need to meticulously prepare to compete against rival companies.

293
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,240
I don't have experience with big projects.

294
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,690
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

295

<i>[The Haitian Convalescence Home]</i>

296
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,432
No one gets experience out of nowhere.

297
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:38,960
If you don't start now, when will you have experience?

298
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,380
You are my son. The group will be handed over to you in the future.

299
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,740
You must start with these projects.

300
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,520
Besides, after additional construction is arranged,

301
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,120
you can stay in there for a while.

302
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,280
I've already notified Director Chen.

303
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,040
He's very experienced in mental rehabilitation.

304
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,840
You didn't come to give me negotiation tips.

305
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,340
This is your real purpose, right?

306
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,140
You've been making a fuss for over a decade. It's time to end it.

307
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,120
So you want to lock me in a convalescent home?

308
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,420
It's not locking you up. It's treatment.

309
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,020
An illness should be treated. What's wrong with that?

310
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,440
Aren't you clear about why I have this illness?

311
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,440
Didn't you help cause it?

312
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,300
Is locking your own son in a convalescent home

313
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,500
something a father should do?

314
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,340
What else do you want?

315
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,920
To make a fuss of it forever?

316
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,280
Ignore your family? Deny your parents?

317
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,392
Gu Yi Chen!

318
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:39,900
Let me make it clear to you.

You've acted on your own whims over a decade,

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,460
making up some kind of "gynophobia" (fear of women).

322
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,672
You've never had a relationship with a woman.

By end of this year, you must marry and start a family!

If you continue this,

your mobile game company is on a dead-end path.
