<i>How could you do that to your roommate's younger brother?</i>

What should I do?

How should I face Zhao Nuan Nuan?

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,700
How can I live under the same roof with her?

36
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Wu Xin Ran,

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,700

Mi Mi.

You are really something.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,800
I just moved from my grandfather's house yesterday, and you found me today.

Wait, what did you just say?

45
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,300
Who was with you last night?

46
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
Zhao Ming Yang.

47
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,700
Zhao Nuan Nuan's younger brother?

48
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,100
Her biological brother? That loyal boy?

49
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,500
Usually, I don't see you both being that close.

50
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,000
Mi Mi, we can't do this again in the future.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,500
We can't drink together next time.

52
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,400
No, there is no next time.

Never, ever!

I'm so envious of you.

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,500
You like Ming Yang, and Ming Yang likes you.

56
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,300
You two are close. How nice.

57
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,400
But he's Nuan Nuan's younger brother.

58
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,800
So what?

59
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,200
Who is Zhao Ming Yang? He's the younger brother of whom?

60
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,000
How does this have anything to do with you liking him?

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,800
It's fine for two people to be together as long as they like each other.

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,900
Why care about what others would say?

63
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,300
Why do you care if he is Zhao Nuan Nuan's younger brother?

64
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
But…

65
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,900
I don't know… whether I like him or not.

I hope everyone can take the pressure and keep up the good work.

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,100
Today, I've also brought a strong backup force for you.

The top recommendation of the industry, Zhao Nuan Nuan.

From today, you'll be the official original artist of Z Mobile Games.

Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

89
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,700
In the future, I will work hard and strive to draw well.

President Gu.

When I'm reciting significant data to you in the future, please

111
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,600
don't smile so happily.

112
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,000
Otherwise, I'll hang you on the wall outside Z Mobile Games.

Lord Nan,

114
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,400
why are you so irritable?

115
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,700
Know this. You must have

116
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,700
peace of mind to do a good job.

117
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,200
<i>I wonder who stepped on his tail the other day.</i>

118
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,900
<i>Now, you've got the nerve to say I need peace of mind?</i>

119
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,000
<i>Fine.</i>

120
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,200
<i>You're the boss. I'll endure it.</i>

121
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,400
These are to be sent out today.

122
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,700
- When the courier gets here, give these to him.
- Okay.

123
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,000
These just arrived. I'll take them up.

124
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
Ming… Ming Yang.

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Why didn't you go home?

126
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
Mi Mi asked me to stay with her for a few days.

127
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,700
- Are you avoiding me?
- No, I'm not.

128
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,100
What's this supposed to mean?

129
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,400
It's nothing much.

130
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,900
"Nothing much"?

131
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,500
You threw money on my bedside and ran away.

132
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,800
What? Are you buying me?

133
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,900
It's not like that, Ming Yang.

134
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,200
You just started your business, and you'll need money.

135
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,300
Although I don't have much money,

136
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,900
I wanted to help you with this money.

137
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,900
I just graduated, and starting a business requires money.

138
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,500
But if I wanted to,

139
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,600
I can ask President Gu, Assistant Sheng, or anyone in the team for help.

140
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,800
I can easily raise the money.

141
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,600
Why would I need yours?

142
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,200
Also, do you have any idea

143
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,400
how I felt when I woke in the morning and saw this on the bedside table?

144
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,000
Ming Yang, don't be like this.

145
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,100
You're still young.

146
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,500
That night, I was drunk and made a mistake.

147
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Just pretend that nothing happened.

149
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,600
So what you're saying is,

150
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,200
that night was a mistake, and you regretted it, right?

151
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,900
Just consider it an adult's mistake.

152
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,300
Ming Yang.

153
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,700
- Sis, it hurts.
- Come here.

154
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,800
Gently, have mercy.

155
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,500
Zhao Ming Yang, you've got some nerve.

156
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,200
You even dared to bully Big Sister Xin Ran.

157
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
What's wrong? Upset because you couldn't borrow money?

158
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
- Angry from humiliation?
- It's painful.

159
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,000
- Be gentle.
- How did I raise such a hopeless brother?

160
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,900
Pain!

161
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,100
It hurts, it hurts.

162
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Mom?

163
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
- You two brats.
- Pain.

164
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Be gentle.

165
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
- Pain.
- Come with me.

166
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,200
Mom, Mom. Go easy on me.

167
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,100
Be gentle. Don't.

168
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,500
Mom.

169
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,000
She really is the Empress Mother.

170
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,400
Speak. Have you both gone mute?

171
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,400
You were both so tough on the phone.

172
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,600
One hung up on me, and the other was out of service.

173
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,400
Mom, I didn't mean to hang up on you.

174
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
I was really busy.

175
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,400
And I didn't mean to be out of service.

176
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,700
He blocked you.

177
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,600
Mom, she's really not busy.

178
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,500
She was transferred to the Original Art Studio yesterday.

179
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,000
She was...

180
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Can we not hurt each other now?

181
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,400
- Right now, we need to be united.
- All right.

182
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
You both

183
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,100
have been playing this game since young.

184
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,200
I've seen this for over twenty years.

185
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,400
Still trying to trick me?

186
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,300
I'm telling you. This time, I've come all the way from home

187
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,300
just to deal with you two.

188
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,500
You, be good and prepare yourself.

189
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
After work, come with me for a blind date.

190
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,700
- Mom.
- And you,

191
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,500
finish all your work left, and come home with me.

192
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,600
- Mom.
- Mom.

193
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,800
Calling me "Mom" won't help.

194
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,200
Blind date.

195
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,100
Resign.

196
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
Are we clear?

197
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,900
President Gu,

198
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,600
I have something to discuss with the Operations Dept.

199
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,100
Go ahead.

200
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,200
Are you going for a meeting?

201
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Then I'll get back to work.

202
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
Okay.

203
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,900
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

204
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,400
President Gu, is there anything else?

205
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,400
<i>[Empress Mother]</i>

206
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,200
Hello?

207
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,900
This is Gu Yi Chen.

208
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,100
I know your platform.

209
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Seven days might be a little tight.
[Office of the President]

210
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,700
Can we do it tomorrow? Okay, tomorrow is fine.

211
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,300
Thank you.

212
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,700
<i>[Office of the President]</i>

213
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,836
Let's go.

214
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,880
Mom.

215
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,596
Let's go.

216
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:58,260
Sit down.

217
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,024
Mom.

218
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,000
Mom, I don't want to go on a blind date.

219
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,280
I've said it a hundred times.

220
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,100
You still have the nerve to say that?

221
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,640
I've called you a hundred times,

222
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,120
and I've lost dignity before my sisters a hundred times.

223
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,360
You always stand people up.

224
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,300
How am I supposed to hang out in my Sunset Sisters' circle?

225
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,580
So why must you force me to go on blind dates, Mom?

226
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,960
Am I… am I forcing you?

227
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,820
Your dad and I worry about you.

228
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,720
Nuan Nuan,

229
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,760
don't keep thinking I'm like those mothers who urge you to marry,

230
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,520
for fear you couldn't marry.

231
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,964
I'm worried that you're alone and unfamiliar with life in this city.

232
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:42,480
If you're mistreated or encounter some troubles,

233
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,400
you don't have anyone to discuss them with.

234
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,680
Plus, when you were young, you weren't very lucky.

235
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,736
If I don't worry about you, who will?

236
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:57,184
I want you to go on blind dates because I'm afraid you'll suffer.

237
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,164
Mom.

238
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,796
I can't trust the boys out there.

239
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:10,700
I only trust those youth

240
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,756
whose family backgrounds I know

241
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:17,520
and who can take care of you.

242
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,800
Only then I feel at ease.

243
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,392
Mom, I get it.

244
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:29,200
I'll do what you ask.

245
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,180
That's good.

246
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,620
Mom.

247
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,960
The boy I'm introducing to you today is someone you met as a child.

248
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,580
He used to frequent your Aunt Shen's house in the front building.

249
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,860
I saw you both playing together for quite a long time during a holiday.

250
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,380
You got along well when you both were young.

251
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,740
When you see him this time, you'll definitely like him.

252
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,504
When we were young? Why don't I remember?

253
00:19:58,504 --> 00:20:00,960
Once you see him, you'll know.

254
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,200
Auntie.

255
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:06,920
He's here.

256
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,960
Over here.

257
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,992
Shen Yan?

258
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,408
Boss, I'm not mistaken, am I?

259
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:30,700
The one who was just sitting next to Nuan Nuan,

260
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,240
was it Shen Yan from the Hechuan Technology project?

261
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,500
Yes, it was him.

262
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,120
So Zhao Nuan Nuan's blind date is Shen Yan?

263
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,480
Qiao Nan, is Nuan Nuan still holding on to any projects?

264
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,128
Has any company approached her to buy the copyrights?

265
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:53,200
We talked two days ago. She hasn't touched the projects she holds.

266
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,540
But she indeed talked to a few companies.

267
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,196
Among them, Hechuan Technology is surely included.

268
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:04,716
Did Shen Yan go on the blind date since he wants the copyrights for her projects?

269
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,972
What's wrong? Are there flowers on my face?

270
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,100
No. I merely

271
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,300
think this world is miraculous.

272
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,800
You met me again, right?

273
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,820
So who previously agreed to meet me at the Plaza Hotel for the blind date,

274
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,956
and stood me up later, was you.

275
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,280
I didn't do it on purpose that day.

276
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,160
I really went that day, but I encountered a little accident.

277
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,620
The accident was encountering Gu Yi Chen?

278
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,380
- How did you know?
- I saw it.

279
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,320
<i>It's fine, Auntie. No need to call again.</i>

280
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,260
<i>I saw her.</i>

281
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,560
Gu Yi Chen and his Z Mobile Games are famous in the industry.

282
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,500
It's hard not to know him.

283
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,160
You know Gu Yi Chen, but how do you also know me?

284
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,148
Only you don't know me.

285
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:17,700
Otherwise, why would I buy one doughnut and get one free to give you?

286
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,540
So at that time, you already...

287
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,952
I'm really sorry.

288
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,740
It was many years since we met so I didn't recognize you.

289
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,160
When I discussed the copyrights with you that day, I didn't remember either.

290
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,280
But I do recall things from when we were children.

291
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,580
I remember one winter snowed heavily.

292
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,140
You lived in our community a long time.

293
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,900
We even spent Chinese New Year together.

294
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,220
You set off fireworks in the snow.

295
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,860
See, it's fine that you remember these.

296
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,300
So when you previously stood me up, Auntie called me here again.

297
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,400
Don't you think you should compensate me?

298
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,792
"Compensate"? What do you mean?

299
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:01,040
Tomorrow is Sunday. Go on a date with me.

300
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,620
<i>After our last discussion,</i>

301
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,860
I did another full current market research on Hechuan Technology.

302
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:14,440
Their market share and also satisfaction rate

303
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,552
are higher than ours.

304
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,400
President Gu Yi Chen,

305
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:28,700
you should get off work.

306
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,280
Where were we? The mobile game will be online next week.

307
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,340
How can I leave now?

308
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,324
You still remember the game goes online.

309
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:42,380
I thought your heart ran 800 miles away.

310
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,220
Zhao Nuan Nuan is only on a blind date. Isn't that so?

311
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,120
Why would I care about what she's doing?

312
00:23:54,948 --> 00:24:00,060
Yi Chen, do you know there's a very mysterious

313
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,628
life-or-death law of blind dating?

314
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,780
What law?

315
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,060
A secret crush will come true. Childhood sweethearts will be lifelong partners.

316
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,620
I heard from Ming Yang that Zhao Nuan Nuan and Shen Yan were childhood playmates.

317
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,480
It's also regarded as half childhood sweethearts.

318
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,200
Their parents know each other. That's practically a direct approval.

319
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,820
Shen Yan is now at Hechuan with a high position, good income,

320
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,800
and he's not bad-looking.

321
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,520
If Zhao Nuan Nuan's heart flutters after their blind date,

322
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,096
they might go directly to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

323
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,840
Qiao Nan, see the wall of Z Mobile Games.

324
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,760
It's really suitable to hang you up there. Do you agree?

325
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,580
No way.

326
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,560
You hung the princess on the city wall three years ago.

327
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,640
Do you admit that you were wrong?

328
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,380
The princess escaped by untying the rope on the third day.

329
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,980
Scumbag, you're dead.

330
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,880
Leaving in such a hurry?

331
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:14,740
Wait.

332
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,408
How did I become the scumbag?

333
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:19,660
He wanted to hang me.

334
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,020
He wants to hang me now, and he wants me dead.

335
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,636
Can you be unreasonable just because you're the boss?

336
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,960
Fang Mi, it's not what you think.

337
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,840
We were just…

338
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,740
Fang Mi? Fang Mi!

339
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,900
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- It's okay.

340
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:06,240
Allow me.

341
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,980
This guy!

342
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,440
The steak here is very delicious.

343
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,632
I heard it's flown from abroad every day with limited supply.

344
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:51,124
So I specially brought you here to try it.

345
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:53,400
You didn't have to go to such trouble.

346
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,060
I can eat anything.

347
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,640
Girls need to be picky.

348
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,088
Only by trying better things, you'll know that some things should be discarded.

349
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:11,080
Sir.

350
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,040
Nuan Nuan, what do you prefer?

351
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,580
Sirloin?

352
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,380
Anything is fine.

353
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,880
<i>[Sirloin, Sold Out]</i>

354
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,080
It seems to be sold out. Shall we change to Chateaubriand?

355
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,140
It's from the veal and particularly tender. It's very delicious.

356
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,570
<i>[Chateaubriand, Sold Out]</i>

357
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,240
What's going on?

358
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,220
I apologize, Sir. It's sold out.

359
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
It's okay.

360
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,320
Then let's eat something else.

361
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,208
Okay.

362
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,340
Qiao Nan, call some people to come here for lunch.

363
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,700
It's my treat.

364
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,004
What?

365
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:17,012
All the seats close together have been reserved?

366
00:28:17,012 --> 00:28:18,740
I'm really sorry, Sir.

367
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,760
Someone reserved all our single-row seats.

368
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,120
Hence, all the existing seats can't be placed close together.

369
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,900
I'm really sorry.

370
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,348
Harry Potter, Snow White, and Hello Kitty.

371
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,940
Want to play?

372
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:48,160
I haven't played in a long time.

373
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,700
And because my luck is bad, I've never gotten the model I liked.

374
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Let's try and see if we are lucky today.

375
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,160
Excuse me, Sir.

376
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,844
Today's capsule toy machine has been contracted out.

377
00:28:58,844 --> 00:29:00,700
Even the mystery box machine can be contracted out?

378
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,360
Sometimes, it happens.

379
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,020
You look a bit tired from having fun today.

380
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,120
Let's find a place to sit down.

381
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,280
Your shoelace is undone.

382
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,320
Thank you. I'll do it myself.

383
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:38,460
Let's go.

384
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,120
The dog is really cute. Look.

385
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,280
D-Don't come near me.

386
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,768
Sorry.

387
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:52,960
Take a look.

388
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,740
I'm sorry.

389
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:03,684
How scary.

390
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:08,920
Who would think the arrogant President Gu would fear dogs?

391
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,400
Fear of dogs is a personal matter.

392
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,908
It shouldn't involve Director Shen, right?

393
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:25,640
Of course, fear of dogs is a small problem.

394
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,620
It can't stop President Gu from dominating the mobile game industry.

395
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,520
But she really likes dogs.

396
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,940
Don't waste time worrying about this.

397
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,060
I have a very good relationship with my employee.

398
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,960
"Employee"?

399
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,844
You call Nuan Nuan an employee?

400
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:49,848
Gu Yi Chen, I thought you were a hero.

401
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,840
I didn't expect you to be so timid. No guts to say you like her, right?

402
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,152
Let go soon and let her come to me.

403
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,380
Your provoking tactic won't work on me.

404
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,772
And don't fake affection in front of me.

405
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:09,056
You don't truly like her.

406
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:14,960
You're on a blind date with Nuan Nuan just to get her projects.

407
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,872
That's right, I do want her mobile game projects.

408
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:21,304
But she's very cute.

409
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:24,820
Maybe from now on, I'll really start to like her.

410
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,700
Don't touch Zhao Nuan Nuan.

411
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,520
Your target is Z Mobile Games and Legend of the Mighty.

412
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,832
If you have courage, don't play dirty.

413
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:37,200
Come at me head-on.

414
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,184
Sure.

415
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,540
Let's compete head-on.

416
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:11,642
