Are you still denying it?

88
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,800
Since we were small, you look away when you lie.

89

You are like that now.

90
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,800
No, no, I'm not.

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
What are you hiding?

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What's wrong with the couch?

93
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,300

94
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,500

No, there isn't!

There's no one behind the couch.

97

No one?

98
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Then why did you set two breakfasts?

99
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,500
Also, two pairs of chopsticks.

100

No, it's just me.

102
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,800
You… Didn't you return for your notebook?

103
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,100
Right, I came for my notebook.

104
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,900
Xin Ran, hurry up. It's not safe here.

105
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Did you hear noise on the balcony?

106
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Is someone still in the house?

107
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
No, there isn't.

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,200
I remember! It's the neighbor's cat.

109
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,400
The next door lady's cat is extremely timid.

110
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,300
Is that right?

111
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,200
Zhao Ming Yang, listen to me.

112
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,700
You'd better not be hiding anything from me,

113
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,200
or I'll teach you a lesson.

114
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,500
Why would I dare hide anything from you?

115
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,200
Aren't you like a little empress dowager?

116
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,000
- What did you say?
- I said my sister is innocent, kind, smart, brave, and

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,900
best in the world.

118
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,500
You're exaggerating the compliments.

119
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,900
I'm just smart and incomparably beautiful.

120
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,800
All right, I'm off to work.

121
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,700
You'd better behave at home.

122

164
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,600
The amount of PDA you two are showing…

165
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm so full, I don't even need lunch anymore. (PDA is known as "dog food.")

166
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
Jealous?

167
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Jealous of your office romance?

168
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,400
What should I be jealous?

169
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,800
If you feel so frustrated, go date someone.

170
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
I can dat—

171
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,100
What did you say?

172
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,200
Gu Yi Chen, I'm warning you.

173
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,000
Even "single dogs" have their dignity.

174
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,800
If you keep throwing your relationship in my face,

175
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,100
be careful I don't quit.

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
All right, let's talk business.

177
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,000
I've finished reading your data analysis.

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,300
But why is only Legend of the Mighty's data increasing

179
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,400
and all other mobile games' data decreasing?

180
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
You noticed that, too?

181
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,500
I noticed it when I did the overall database analysis.

182
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,200
Although our reach rate (views) increased this quarter,

183
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
the overall business volume has decreased.

184
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,800
While the rate of decline is only a fraction of a percent,

185
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,800
the trend data is slightly decreasing.

186
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,500
- Have you identified what's wrong?
- Not yet.

187
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:50,200
We may have to re-calculate all mobile game projects in the company.

188
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,400
What's the situation with UA and Hechuan?

189
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,600
After Legend of the Mighty launched, we didn't hear much from them.

190
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,600
During the Expo, I attended their project presentation meeting.

191
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,000
The general feeling was they kept a low profile.

192
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,300
You mean they've even reduced project promotions?

193
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,400
In terms of quantity, yes.

194
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,800
After UA and Hechuan merge their resources, they should be very formidable.

195
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,200
Before UA came to China, they were very bold and aggressive.

196
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,800
There is no reason to keep a low profile after teaming up with Hechuan.

197
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,400
Actually, I've done much data analysis lately.

198
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,000
Based on your analysis, it does seem strange.

199
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,400
Could they be working on another project,

200
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,700
planning to catch us off guard?

201
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,840
No news from UA and Hechuan means we should beware.

202
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,960
Qiao Nan, I'll leave the rest to you.

203
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,880
- Investigate them fully.
- Okay.

204
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,080
There's a top-level industry meeting this afternoon.

205
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,728
I'll go.

206
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,800
I will go.

207
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,620
You? You're going personally?

208
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,420
Recently, you've worked hard on big data analysis.

209
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,960
Let me go this time. I can look at the industry and what's happening at Hechuan.

210
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,860
But this is a meeting hosted by the industry association.

211
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,480
Top executives from major companies and media representatives will be present.

212
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,880
I can't help you manage relationships. I fear if you go alone…

213
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,320
It's all right. Someone said,

214
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,900
she hoped I could slowly open my heart and return to the crowd.

215
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,820
Perhaps now is the best time to start.

Why are you back?

226
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,360
Isn't there a group meeting at the program center today?

227
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,440
This was already done.

228
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,860
Today, the center did some testing on our new phase program,

229
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,520
and teachers found a few bugs.

230
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,120
We may need to re-test once repairs are made.

231
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,040
Please take a look, Group Leader.

232
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,640
Driver, start the car.

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Isn't this a ride-sharing car?

235
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,360
Driver, I want to share a ride.

236
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,700
Come on. I've been working overtime for a week.

237
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,440
I can finally go home early today.

238
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,000
Can you let me go home and rest?

239
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,920
Senior Nan, you've really lost weight.

240
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,500
You need the power of love to recharge.

241
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,660
Fang Mi.

242
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,080
I've found the taste of happiness.

243
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,480
Don't you want to try it with me?

Senior Nan,

249
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,380
don't underestimate this porridge bowl. It may seem ordinary,

250
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,720
but after I came back to China, it's the warmest, tastiest

251
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,120
and most comforting food I've eaten.

252
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,240
- Is it really that amazing?
- Of course.

253
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,060
It's almost as good as my sweet lunch, just slightly less.

254
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,640
If you're looking for the taste of happiness, this is definitely it.

255
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,100
Last time I only took one bite, and it was especially comforting.

256
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,040
It really tastes like mom's home cooking.

257
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,920
"Like mom's home cooking"?

258
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,120
Quick, try it.

259
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,460
How does it taste? Is it good?

260
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,340
Does it warm your heart?

261
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,280
Isn't this the taste of happiness you were searching for?

262
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,576
Can you taste the flavor of home, of mom's home cooking?

263
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,300
- Miss, your sweet porridge is also ready.
- Thank you.

264
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,100
Enjoy your meal.

Do you still remember you have a son?

It seems in his sixth year,

275
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,100
the day you left home, he fell down the stairs and died.

276

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

277

I didn't mean to leave you behind.

I really couldn't go on.

279
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,260
You saw how he drank day and night.

280
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,860
His drunkenness was a disaster at home.

281

I really couldn't go on.

282
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,600
So to avoid it, you left me?

283
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,476
What about me?

284
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,540
When you left, did you ever think your son was only six?

285
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,180
What could he possibly do?

286

Don't pretend that you care.

Since you chose to abandon me in the first place,

don't worry how I grew up or how I lived.

Mr. Shen, since Hechuan Technology's cooperation with UA,

307
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,180
things were so quiet. Why?

308
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,800
Yes, at this time of the year, Hechuan should be launching new projects,

309
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,120
but we haven't had any news.

310
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,140
Do you have any new plans, or are you preparing to surprise Hechuan's players and the public?

311
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,448
Please share something.

312
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:56,320
After the announcement of Hechuan's cooperation with UA this year,

313
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,280
we plan to make significant adjustments.

Why? Didn't Director Shen review all the operational news of recent years first?

The past is the past. This year is different.

00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,680
Is this related to the UA cooperation?

321
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,360
Is this because UA is in control of the new project?

00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,400
He doesn't usually attend these meetings.

324
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,280
Why did he suddenly show up today?

325
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,920
- President Gu!
- President Gu, you personally attended the conference.

326
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,940
- Is there a special reason?
- Yes.

327
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,360
President Gu, does Z Mobile Games have any special plans for this year,

328
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,060
or do you have any new projects besides those shown at the Expo?

329
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,720
President Gu, please give us a hint. Say something.

330
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,660
<i>- President Gu!
- President Gu!</i>

331
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,860
President Gu, say something, President Gu.

332
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,260
President Gu, say something!

333
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,160
President Gu, please give us a hint.

334
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,920
President Gu, do you have any special plans this year?

335
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,860
Please give us an answer, President Gu!

336
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,560
<i>President Gu, we are reporters from Game Lover.</i>

337
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,060
Please accept this interview.

338
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,900
President Gu, please accept this interview.

339
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,380
President Gu!

340
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,000
Would you agree to an interview, President Gu?

341
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,040
President Gu, please accept this interview.

342
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,560
Let's stop here for today.

343
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,580
The project will take a long time to complete.

344
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,800
Let's pace ourselves.

345
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,140
Go back and rest early.

346
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,640
Okay.

347
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,020
I'm sorry, Group Leader! I'll do it, I'll do it. Sorry.

348
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,720
It's okay, the hard drive is shock-resistant.

349
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
Sorry, sorry! I'm really sorry.

350
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,900
That's all right. It's my fault today's meeting took so long.

351
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,460
You must all be exhausted. Go back and rest early.

352
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,580
This is still where I feel most comfortable drawing.

353
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,980
By the way, Xiao Yu said the programmers found a bug today.

354
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,940
What is this?

355
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,020
Why is this in my computer?
<i>[Security Guarantee]</i>

356
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,040
Thank you, Qiao Nan.

357
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:20,328

<i>[Tomb of Grandfather Sheng Ming Cheng and Grandmother Fan Zhi Ying]</i>

359
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,680
It's so late already.

360
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,080
Hasn't Yi Chen returned yet?

361
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,280
<i>The number you called is currently not available.</i>

362
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,580
<i>Please call again later.</i>

363
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,700
<i>Sorry, the subscriber you called does not answer.</i>

364
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,308
He didn't answer.

365
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,340
President Gu, our interview will only take a few minutes.

366
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,160
Who do you think you are? What do you think this place is?

367
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,280
Do you think you can interview him at will?

368
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,076
Get out!

369
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,336
Luo Yi?
