By the way, has Gu Yi Chen arrived?

President Gu? They meet Monday mornings in the meeting room.

72

It's about the next step for Z Mobile Games.

73
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Anyway, it's quite serious.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The past week's work situation was roughly like this:

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,800
a completion rate about 70%.

76
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,900
Some departments didn't complete designated work according to the plan,

77
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,700
which caused some delay in operations.

78
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,900
I understand that sound effects and music production need time.

79
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,300
But Legend of the Mighty II's internal testing has already been set.

80
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,700
Other departments need enough preparation time.

81
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,200
Also, the main program's testing is very straightforward.

82
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,900
How about I give you one more week?

83
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,200
Okay, President Gu.

84
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,000
The market that Z Mobile Games faces is very complex now.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,400
Although we are still at the top of the industry,

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm sure you all saw UA's partnership with Hechuan Technology some time ago.

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,300
UA has experience and control over the project,

88
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
and Hechuan Technology does marketing and operations.

89
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,800
They are both our strong competitors.

90
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,600
In the next period, Z Mobile Games will face one tough battle after another.

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,100
From top to bottom, all in the company must be alert.

92
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,400
We absolutely cannot lose to Hechuan.

93
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,600
The meeting ends here today. Dismissed.

Zhao Ming Yang,

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,200
I heard you seek a work studio recently.

100
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, after finishing Legend,

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,600
I will start my own studio with my team.

102

Very ambitious.

103
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,500
President Gu, you are the same.

104
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,800
When you founded Z Mobile Games, you were very ambitious, too.

105
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Are you praising me so I invest in you?

106
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Of course not.

107
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,700
I wouldn't want my studio to have the title of another company when it's established.

108
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,800
You are indeed siblings.

109
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,600
You're both stubborn when it comes to dreams.

110

Excuse me?

111
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,200
Nothing.

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,000
I hope your studio issue won't affect Legend of the Mighty's production.

113

I look forward to your work.

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,100
Sorry, I haven't thought about it yet.

159
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,800
Is it ¥600,000 ($83,000)?

160
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,900
Three million yuan ($415,000)?

161
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Oh, my gosh.

162
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,200
Quickly answer it.

163
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,700
- Hello, Assistant Sheng.
- It's Senior Nan.

164
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,500
Why are you calling me?

165
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,200
I'll be up in a bit.

166
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
What?

167
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,800
The company also wants to buy the copyright to my project?

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,100
Assistant Sheng, for such an important cooperation,

169
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,400
shouldn't it be President Gu who personally talks to me?

170
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,200
What? She wants me to talk to her personally?

171
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
Yes.

172
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,000
She's really spoiled.

173
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
What did you say?

174
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,700
Nothing.

175
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,800
The company's project reserves have always been entrusted to you.

176
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Moreover, such a small copyright doesn't need my personal involvement.

177
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,500
Qiao Nan, I'll leave it to you.

178
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,000
What? He really said that?

179
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,300
I thought this willful CEO had changed his ways, but

180
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,200
it turns out he's still the same as before.

181
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,300
He should be the one to ask me, yet he still acts high and mighty to me.

182
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,900
Nuan Nuan, I know it wasn't easy for you to do this project.

183
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,800
Now, you also won first place in the association's competition.

184
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,000
Many companies out there must target your project.

185
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,700
However, you are a Z Mobile Games' employee after all.

186
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,900
I hope you consider our own company first.

187
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,300
So the company really needs my project, right?

188
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,900
Okay, I can consider our company first.

189
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,700
But I have conditions.

190
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,000
Go ahead.

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,100
I want Gu Yi Chen to transfer me to the concept art studio,

192
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,400
not a division in his office, but the real studio.

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,000
Secondly, I want to follow up on this project myself.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,400
The company can assign a project director,

195
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,000
but I want to be in charge of the art.

196
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,500
Thirdly, I don't want to go to his office anymore,

197
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,200
let alone be his exclusive cleaner.

198
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,600
Student Nuan Nuan, you've become arrogant.

199
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,800
You're inflated.

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,100
She wants to be transferred to the concept art studio.

201
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,400
She wants to move out of my office.

202
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,100
And she doesn't want to be my–

203
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,500
Yi Chen, I think we can make that happen.

204
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,400
After all, when Zhao Nuan Nuan came for an interview,

205
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
she aimed for the job of concept artist.

206
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,300
Although we took a big detour, now all is back on track, right?

207
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,000
Besides, the industry association's win is very impressive.

208
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,300
I guess many companies out there aim for her project.

209
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,300
We are also in a critical period with Hechuan.

210
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,400
We should keep this project.

211
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,200
I will take it as a "yes" if you don't speak.

212
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Then let's do it this way.

213
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Qiao Nan–

214
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,390
- Well…
- Slow down.

215
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,600
<i>[Concept Art Studio's Division in the President's Office]</i>

216
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,410
That...

217
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,370
<i>[Concept Art Studio's Division in the President's Office]</i>

218
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,400
<i>[Unknown number]</i>

219
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,000
Hello? This is Zhao Nuan Nuan.

220
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
May I ask who is this?

221
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,900
So it's you.

222
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,500
The doughnut.

223
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,800
What a coincidence!

224
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,100
I didn't expect to meet you so soon.

225
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,800
Oh, the doughnut last time was delicious.

226
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,500
I haven't transferred you the money yet.

227
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,000
I didn't come about the doughnut.

228
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
Then why are you here?

229
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,400
I got your phone number

230
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
from Mobile Games Recommendation Assoc.

231
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,200
So you're also here for my first-place project.

232
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes.

233
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
I didn't introduce myself yet.

234
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,500
My name is Shen Yan, Director of Operations Department at Hechuan Technology.

235
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:53,316
<i>[Shen Yan: Operations Director of Hechuan Technology]</i>

236
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,800
Sorry, I'm late. I've been too busy with work.

237
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,000
It's okay. I've arranged for us to meet the landlord upstairs.

238
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,800
It will probably take only half an hour.

239
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,200
Okay, let's go up.

240
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay, let's go.

241
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,720
<i>[C1]</i>

242
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Feel free to look around.

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
How is it?

244
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,400
How is it? Do you think it's suitable?

245
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,000
The decoration needs some work,

246
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,500
but the size of the place, the price, and the layout are all very good.

247
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,800
You're picky.

248
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,200
This is the cheapest, most spacious place in a ten-mile radius.

249
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,700
If it weren't for your girlfriend begging me sincerely,

250
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,000
I wouldn't agree to rent it to you at such a low price.

251
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,800
I-I'm not his girlfriend.

252
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
- We—
- Older woman, younger man relationship, I understand.

253
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
But you still have to thank her.

254
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,370
She has visited me more than a dozen times in the past few days.

255
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,900
No, I just happened to pass by.

256
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,000
It's just on the way.

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,800
How about you guys take a closer look?

258
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,100
I have something to do so I won't accompany you.

259
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
If you decide, give me a call.

260
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,600
- Okay.
- Thank you.

261
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,900
- Okay, bye bye.
- Thank you.

262
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,000
Now that the place is settled, you can be relieved.

263
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,700
Next is to coordinate and arrange this place's decoration and procurement.

264
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,100
I will help you set up the studio at the lowest price promptly.

265
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,400
Wu Xin Ran.

266
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,700
Zhao Ming Yang, what are you doing? Put me down quickly!

267
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,900
Be still.

268
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
If you struggle, I'll drop you.

269
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,800
Put me down now!

270
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,400
Wasn't Hechuan only interested in large-scale combat mobile games?

271
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,800
MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) and RTS (real-time strategy) games are your main focus.

272
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,600
Also, after your company and UA announced cooperation,

273
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,400
your operations and related data show you mainly target the male mobile game market.

274
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,600
It seems you're quite familiar with our company.

275
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,400
I just needed to be familiar with this industry.

276
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,600
After all, I'm in this profession.

277
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
You did thorough research on each company and market data.

278
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,300
This shows you have potential to excel in this profession.

279
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,800
Do you really think so?

280
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,500
It's not what I think. It's what everyone thinks in the Recommendation Association.

281
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,400
You won first place in the competition.

282
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,500
Since we joined hands with UA,

283
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
most projects we reserved are indeed real-time combat games,

284
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,500
RTS games, and typical male-oriented mobile games.

285
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,200
But this doesn't mean we will give up on other market types.

286
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,300
For example, entertainment games, puzzle games, and social simulation games.

287
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,500
Although these games have a smaller market share and higher investment costs,

288
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,600
it does not mean that Hechuan Technology is a single-type company.

289
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,500
But my project is a female-oriented romance mobile game.

290
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,000
That's exactly what we lack.

291
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,500
To be precise, this is currently rare in the entire industry.

292
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,200
In the past, romance mobile games were mostly imported from Japan, U.S.A, and other countries.

293
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,000
Their art style, player habits, and post-dubbing

294
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
differ and can't be fully adapted to the domestic market.

295
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Your project fills this gap.

296
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,800
That's why as soon as your project won the award,

297
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,000
so many companies called you.

298
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,500
It's the real reason why they want to buy your copyright.

299
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,800
But my project–

300
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,900
I know, you're an employee of Z Mobile Games.

301
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,000
But you can consider selling the project to us,

302
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
or you can come to our company directly.

303
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,800
I very much welcome you there, Nuan Nuan.

304
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,700
<i>This guy, Shen Yan, is really impressive.</i>

305
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,600
<i>No wonder Gu Yi Chen values Meilin's investment so much.</i>

306
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,100
<i>With a competitor like Hechuan Technology</i>

307
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,300
<i>and someone like Shen Yan in it,</i>

308
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,100
<i>it's quite an unpredictable rival for Z Mobile Games.</i>

309
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,300
<i>Although the boss of Z Mobile Games is too stubborn,</i>

310
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,000
<i>I've wanted to join Z Mobile Games since college</i>

311
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
<i>and complete my project there.</i>

312
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
I have never thought

313
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,400
of Hechuan Technology.

314
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,900
Forget it. I'll return to the company and discuss it with Assistant Sheng first.

315
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,200
If Gu Yi Chen could really agree to transfer me to the concept art studio

316
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,800
and let me complete my project myself, that would be great.

317
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
Zhao Ming Yang, put me down.

318
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
P-Put me down.

319
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,000
Hurry up.

320

♫ <i>He always quietly appears</i> ♫

♫ <i>Why is it always he who stirs my heart?</i> ♫

322
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Ming Yang, where did you go? We need to get back to the company quickly.

323
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,600
My shoes… M-Ming Yang!

324
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,300
Don't move.

325
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,200
Zhao Ming Yang, you can't do this.

326
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
I said not to move.

327
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,200
♫ <i>Why do I feel like my heart skips a beat?</i> ♫

This bipolar water (spray medication) can disinfect your wound without irritation. It won't hurt.

330
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,200
But you are pressing my ankle so hard that it hurts.

331
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,400
Then why run there more than a dozen times in such high heels?

332
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,800
Do you think you're Iron Man, who won't hurt or get injured?

333
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,000
I just wanted to help you find a place sooner.

334
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,900
I can find one myself.

335
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,700
Your feet are blistered.

336
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,800
What if they scar?

337
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Can't you be like Zhao Nuan Nuan and wear flat shoes more often?

338
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,300
You're going to work, not a beauty pageant.

339
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
Did you hear me?

340
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,800
Well, I need to rush to work now.

341
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm leaving now.

342
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,300
♫ <i>If you want me, too</i> ♫

343

♫ <i>Don't just stand there in silence</i> ♫

344
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,500
Sister Xin Ran, you were almost late.

345
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,770
<i>[Z.M.G. Tech.com]</i>

346
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
The sign-in form.

347
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,800
Sister Xin Ran, what's wrong?

348
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,500
I'm fine.

349
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,400
The project is still not settled. Why not just give in a bit?

350
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,600
She always wanted to go to the concept art studio anyway.

351
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,700
I don't think it's a big problem.

352
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,800
Or we can find an art director to guide her.

353
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,100
Maybe she could produce a great piece of work.

354
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,600
Qiao Nan, this is not about giving in or not.

355
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,200
After taking a close look at Nuan Nuan's project,

356
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,400
I've found her content is not mature enough.

357
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,900
I looked at other works from the industry association's competitions.

358
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,900
They are all very good, including our projects and Hechuan's.

359
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,200
They all made it to the final round.

360
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,100
Why do you think Zhao Nuan Nuan became the top recommendation this time?

361
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Why?

362
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,200
Because Hechuan Technology and we compete for investment,

363
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,700
whether it's cooperation with UA or Meilin's investment.

364
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,200
Everyone has seen the war between us and Hechuan Technology.

365
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,900
The industry association is no exception.

366
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,400
This time, they cleverly avoided the projects we and Hechuan selected,

367
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,500
just to avoid further competition between the two leading companies.

368
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,000
If first and second place were determined among us and Hechuan,

369
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,900
the subsequent competition

370
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,400
would become even more intense.

371
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,200
So

372
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,000
it's not that Zhao Nuan Nuan's romance mobile game

373
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
is so outstanding.

374
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
<i>But the industry association made a compromise.</i>

375
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,400
Nuan Nuan was just lucky.

376
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,400
<i>So that's how it is.</i>

377
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,900
But I–

378
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,300
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

379
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,400
What did you say? Say it again.

380
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,900
What's wrong with my project?

381
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,500
What do you mean by "lucky"?

382
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,700
What do you mean by "compromise"?

383
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,600
So in your eyes, is my project the garbage forcibly chosen by the industry association?

384
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,100
- That's not what I meant.
- You clearly meant that.

385
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,600
Your eyes have told me that's exactly what you meant.

386
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

387
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,200
It's my fault.

388
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,900
In the past few days, I've joined Z Mobile Games and interacted with you.

389
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,400
I thought we were no longer like adversaries.

390
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
You respected and approved of me.

391
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
You would even let me help you overcome your difficulties.

392
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,300
Sometimes, I thought you considered me a friend.

393
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,700
But I was wrong.

394
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,700
You're still that arrogant, conceited, willful,

395
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,300
and selfish boss who tramples on others' efforts.

396
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,600
Nuan Nuan, I have never looked down on you.

397
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,000
You have!

398
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,300
Since the day of the interview, you mocked my work and scolded my lateness.

399
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,800
You looked down on my professionalism.

400
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,900
You thought I could never produce good work.

401
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,200
You wouldn't transfer me to the concept art studio.

402
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,100
You stuffed me into your office to be your personal cleaner.

403
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
But I've drawn almost 20 years.

404
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,000
I've studied day and night.

405
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,700
I'm here to fulfill my dream, not be your exclusive cleaner.

406
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,400
No matter how high and mighty you are, no matter how many impressive works you have,

407
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,600
in my eyes, my project is the best.

408
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,300
I want to be a concept artist.

409
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,400
I want to create my own mobile game.

410
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,100
If Z Mobile Games won't give me a chance,

411
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,800
then I'll leave.

412
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,700
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

413
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,550
<i>[South Tower]</i>

414
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,280
Can you not be so impulsive?

415
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,260
Give her time to digest it.

416
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,220
Okay, then I'll go find Gu Yi Chen.

417
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,760
Could you please calm down a bit?

418
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,720
What's the use of seeing President Gu right now?

419
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,720
To teach him a lesson. I can't just stand by while he bullies my sister.

420
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,720
Don't be rash when things happen.

421
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,384
Let's discuss it tonight.

422
00:26:50,384 --> 00:26:51,920
But–

423
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,360
<i>It's not that Zhao Nuan Nuan's romance mobile game is so outstanding.</i>

424
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,220
<i>But the industry association made a compromise.</i>

425
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,740
<i>Nuan Nuan was just lucky.</i>

426
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,200
Gu Yi Chen, you big meanie!

427
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:51,008
<i>[Zhao Nuan Nuan]</i>

428
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,412
Forget it.

429
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,740
Dad, did I do something wrong?

430
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,300
When I was unlucky, I was looked down upon.

431
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,936
Now that my luck has turned, I'm still looked down upon.

432
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,004
I spent four months on the project,

433
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:06,092
and I even got first place from the industry association.

434
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:09,580
Yet in the end, he still said

435
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,340
I was just lucky.

436
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,104
If that's the kind of luck, I'd rather not have it!

437
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:22,008
Nuan Nuan, why do you draw?

438
00:29:22,612 --> 00:29:24,160
Because I enjoy it.

439
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,280
<i>Then have you ever regretted your choice to draw?</i>

440
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,480
Never.

441
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,192
<i>See? Isn't that your answer?</i>

442
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:38,164
Nuan Nuan, the most worthwhile thing in life

443
00:29:38,164 --> 00:29:41,440
is to go all out for what you love most.

444
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,700
<i>It will make you feel that life and your time are worth it.</i>

445
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,850
<i>So you shouldn't care if you're unlucky or lucky.</i>

446
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,480
You just need to care about

447
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,000
what you've gained

448
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,400
and achieved

449
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,460
in your passion.

450
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,180
- Dad.
- Yes.

451
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,180
<i>Nuan Nuan, all will encounter setbacks, failures, and hits</i>

452

in the process of pursuing their dreams.

453
00:30:05,592 --> 00:30:08,504
But when you really hold your dream in your hand,

454
00:30:08,504 --> 00:30:09,720
you'll find

455
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,360
those small failures

456
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,640
are like grains of sand

457
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,456
that are gone with the wind.

458
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:17,400
<i>Nuan Nuan, I believe in your perseverance, intelligence,</i>

459
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,780
<i>and even more in your persistence in your dream.</i>

460
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,060
So don't care about others' opinions.

461
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,020
You just need to do what you want to do and stick to it bravely.

462
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,600
<i>Your mom and I will always be the</i>

00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:35,960
<i>Thank you.</i>

466
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,620
<i>I know what I should do now.</i>

<i>Nuan Nuan, you must believe</i>

that it's the best arrangement.

470
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,440
I believe in you.

<i>Take care of your sister.

472
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,268
Oh no.

473
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:36,060
How did Dad know I was at Zhao Nuan Nuan's place?

474
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,680
But why is he always talking about Zhao Nuan Nuan?
