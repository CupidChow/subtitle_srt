Why give them all the project money you received?

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,300
Now you don't even have money for a cab.

Don't pretend to be a saint,

No way.

33

I won't be as unlucky as Zhao Nuan Nuan,

Never mind.

As long as Zhao Nuan Nuan doesn't fight with her roommate

and is free from bad luck,

43

it's worth my sleeping in a garden.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,500
Belle. Fairy. Queen.

Your sister seems to have no time to lecture you.

Mr. Dong.

56
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,300
- You may leave.
- Okay.

57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,400
Ling Mei, next time you enter, knock first.

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,300
No, I was in a hurry.

59
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,500
Two sisters just called. They both said Yi Chen has a girlfriend.

60
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,200
Why are they so worried about him?

61
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,400
Aren't you worried? Anyway, I've pondered it a long time.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,900
I think this matter is too strange.

63
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,200
Look, Yi Chen was back in China for years.

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,300
He never mentioned he had a girlfriend, did he?

65
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,800
How come he suddenly has a girlfriend,

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,100
and they seem to be very close?

67
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,200
However, their closeness is very odd.

68
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,400
<i>- How's it going?</i>
- Not very well.

69
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,100
Guess who came to talk to me today?

70
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,400
Mr. Dong from Meilin Investment.

71
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,100
"Meilin"?

72
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,800
Meilin Investment is owned by Gu Group.

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
It is controlled by your father.

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,700
Their approach to me shows your father wasn't joking with you.

75
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,000
If Meilin's big cash flow enters our market, next to UA and Hechuan,

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
there will be more trouble afterward.

<i>arrive on time with your girlfriend for the group's thirtieth anniversary party.</i>

<i>Zhao Ming Yang, you can stay here,</i>

80
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,200
<i>but you must pay a price.</i>

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,800
Excuse me, Your Ladyship. Do you need anything else?

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,700
Please bring me two bowls of high-protein, low-fat, and plant-based drinks.

83
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,400
High-protein, low-fat, and plant-based?

84
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Soy milk.

85
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,900
Wait a minute.

86
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,900
To make the soy milk I like, the beans must be fresh.

87
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't want dry ones soaked overnight.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,700
The liquid has to be freshly extracted.

89
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,400
I won't drink anything that's older than half an hour.

90
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,200
The temperature has to be 65 degrees.

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,200
If it's one degree lower or higher, I can't drink it.

92
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,100
Also, I want half sweetness,

93
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,400
and Nuan Nuan wants full sweetness.

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,200
All right, Your Ladyship.

95
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,500
Also, do not use ice to cool it down.

96
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,600
It will reduce the soy milk richness.

97
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,000
I will deduct you points for that.

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,200
All right.

99
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,700
<i>Someone should have tamed Zhao Ming Yang long ago.</i>

100
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,000
<i>See if he dares disrespect me again.</i>

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,400
I think he treats you quite well.

102
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,800
Do you?

103
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,400
That's because you haven't seen him betray me.

104
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,000
When we were small, he told me to soak all of mom's cosmetics in the bathtub.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,500
Then he blamed me, claiming I wanted to bathe them.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,300
Did your mother punish you?

107
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,900
She almost broke my legs.

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,550
So in my opinion, Zhao Ming Yang is not a puppy

109
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,900
but a wolf pup who bites.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,900
Sister Xin Ran, are you no longer angry at me?

111
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,900
Of course not. Last time, you saved me in front of the boss.

112
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,700
Okay? Each person gets one time.

No, I will not.

116

President Gu is Chairman Gu's son so he'll likely attend, right?

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,100
All right.

161
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760
You look beautiful in it.

162
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,000
I didn't expect President Gu's excellent taste.

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,500
The dress you chose fits her perfectly.

164
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,500
This is barely acceptable.

165
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Wait a second.

166
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,300
Turn around.

167
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,400
You didn't zip it up.

168
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,000
I can't reach it.

169
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,800
♫ <i>Always secretly protecting me</i> ♫

170
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,400
♫ <i>White hair slowly shows up</i> ♫

171
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,100
♫ <i>Wrinkles at the corners of the eyes</i> ♫

172
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,800
♫ <i>Now it's my turn</i> ♫

173
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,600
♫ <i>To shield you from wind and rain</i> ♫

174
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
♫ <i>And to love you</i> ♫

175
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,200
What's wrong?

176
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,100
The zipper…

177
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,600
is stuck.

178
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,200
That shouldn't happen.

179
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm not that big, am I?

180
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,700
Manager.

181
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
Take care of this.

182
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,100
All right.

183
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,600
The mended clothes will be sent directly to the venue.

184
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,400
Now come with me to buy a pair of shoes.

185
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,300
Wait a minute. President Gu, can you explain first?

186
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,600
You took me to the beauty center, then you buy me clothes and shoes.

187
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,000
What exactly are you doing?

188
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,400
Tonight is Gu Group's thirtieth anniversary party.

189
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,200
Gu Group's chairman, Gu Zheng Lin, is my father.

190
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,600
I need you to act as my girlfriend and accompany me to the party.

191
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I-Is Gu Group the super famous listed group

192
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,200
covering over a dozen industries?

193
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,700
Yes.

194
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Zhao Nuan Nuan?

195
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm sorry, President Gu. Maybe I can't fulfill your request.

196
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,000
You should find someone else.

197
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,700
Don't forget. We have a cooperation agreement.

198
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,600
Now you're a Z Mobile Games employee

199
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,200
and in a cooperation with me.

200
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,200
You should and must fulfill your obligations.

201
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,800
Even if I'm a Z Mobile Games employee,

202
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,600
I don't have to accompany you to such an event.

203
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,800
Gu Group is such a big famous company.

204
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,000
Their anniversary must be very grand.

205
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,800
Many celebrities and VIPs will be there.

206
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
You are Chairman Gu's son.

207
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,200
You're used to such events,

208
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,900
but I'm just a regular person.

209
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm an ordinary, common girl who is often unlucky.

210
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,600
I've never worn such an expensive dress

211
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
nor attended a high-profile party.

212
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,800
I don't even know how to drink wine.

213
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,100
I want to stay by your side and borrow your good luck,

214
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,900
but I never thought of accompanying you to a grand event,

215
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:07,400
much less act as your girlfriend before so many strangers.

216
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,900
What are you saying?

217
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,200
In any case, I won't go.

218
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,700
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

219
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I won't go.

220
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,800
I don't care if you fire me from Z Mobile Games or deduct my entire salary,

221
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,200
I just can't go!

222
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,300
Find someone else.

223
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,040
President Gu, your clothes.

224
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,240
Qiao Nan, come and pick me up immediately!

225
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,320
Zhao Nuan Nuan, you coward!

226
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,660
You always wanted luck and to attract good things.

227
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,620
Now a president asks you to pose as his girlfriend

228
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,400
and to be at a high-profile event,

229
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,240
yet you ran away?

230
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,640
You're such a coward!

231
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,736
But this is a big corporation.

232
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,480
I was never out all night in a nightclub.

233
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,160
How do I socialize there

234
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,680
and pose with the Chairman's only son?

235
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,020
That's too difficult.

236
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,820
Forget it. I won't go.

237
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:50,620
Where is he?

238
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,720
Over here.

239
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,340
Thank you.

240
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,708
Are you okay?

241
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,456
Yi Chen, don't worry about it.

242
00:19:04,456 --> 00:19:09,900
Maybe this event is too sudden and imposing for a young girl.

243
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,696
You should at least give her time to think it over.

244
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:13,960
Okay, don't worry.

245
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,040
I'll call her in a while and coax her again.

246
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,980
Let's go.

247
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,400
Where to?

248
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,260
We'll go like this.

249
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,356
Are you sure?

250
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:29,260
If you go alone and your father sees you, won't that verify your problem?

251
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,220
You don't relate to him well as it is.

252
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,824
If this continues, it will be irreparable.

253
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,672
I shouldn't have lied to him.

254
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:39,520
I should admit my phobia to him.

255
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,480
Gu Yi Chen.

256
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,392
Whatever the consequences,

257
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:48,680
if he turns on me,

258
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,688
humiliates me at the party

259
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:56,340
or if Z Mobile Games sinks into an irreparable crisis,

260
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,320
all this is my fault.

261
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,196
I will take full responsibility.

262
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:03,480
Yi Chen! Yi Chen!

263
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:09,516
<i>[Gu Group: 30 Years Party]</i>

264
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,160
Miss, look here, please.

265
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,708
Over here.

266
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,640
Sir, you're here.

267
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,760
- Is everything ready?
- Don't worry. They arranged everything well.

268
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,180
Chairman,

269
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,040
tonight, other than major company executives and guests,

270
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,980
will Yi Chen be coming?

271
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,900
What does it matter if he comes or not?

272
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,460
It's like this. As stated in our last investment report,

273
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,520
besides Yi Chen's Z Mobile Games

274
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,460
and his old rivals, UA and Hechuan Technology....

275
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,852
Investing is a professional trade.

276
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:47,864
Which company is worthwhile,

277
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:50,600
which company to invest in,

278
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,460
and which investment will bring profits are all issues you need to consider.

279
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,520
Yes.

280
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,980
I hired you to run Meilin,

281
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,000
not to monitor my every move.

282
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Do you understand?

283
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,580
I understand, Sir.

284
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,500
Sir, please come inside.

285
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,600
Nuan Nuan, why are you back?

286
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,100
Didn't Mi Mi say tonight is Gu Group's 30-year party?

287
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,160
She went with her grandfather.

288
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,640
Isn't President Gu going?

289
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,960
Whether he goes or not,

290
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,220
I don't know.

291
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,228
I have a headache. I'm going to my room.

292
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,060
<i>He will go, won't he?</i>

293
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,320
<i>Or maybe he won't.</i>

294
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,860
<i>He won't go alone, will he?</i>

295
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,060
<i>If he goes alone,</i>

296
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,780
<i>won't our act of posing as a couple for his relatives a few days ago</i>

297
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,160
<i> be exposed?</i>

298
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,120
<i>No, no, he surely won't go.</i>

299
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,340
<i>But what if he does go?</i>

300
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,120
<i>If he goes or not,</i>

301
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,700
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

302
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,220
How did this happen?

303
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,360
I just wanted to stay with him and share a little of his good luck.

304
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,960
I dislike being unlucky daily.

305
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,120
I just want to fulfill my dream of mobile games.

306
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,000
No, don't consider it anymore.

307
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,100
I need to focus on drawing.

308
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,420
If he's a lucky charm or Z Mobile Games' boss,

309
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,660
today I just want to draw.

310
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,590
<i>[Mi's Video Call]</i>

311
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:16,260
Hello, Mi Mi.

312
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,464
Sister Xin Ran, I'm at Gu Group's anniversary party.

313
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,060
Look!

314
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,380
So many people are here, and they are so beautiful!

315
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,300
You are the most beautiful.

316
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,960
You are so sweet.

317
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,516
By the way, Mi Mi, did President Gu and Assistant Sheng go today?

318
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,860
I don't think I saw them.

319
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,340
Will President Gu come tonight?

320
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,720
And Senior Qiao Nan?

321
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,080
I think I just saw them.

322
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,680
Chairman Gu is here.

323
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,000
- Sir.
- Sir.

324
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,640
This time, compared to other investment projects,

325
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,820
Yi Chen's Z Mobile Games has many advantages.

326
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,660
I am very optimistic about his project.

327
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,900
Zheng Lin, you're here.

328
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,600
I just saw Presidents Chen and Li.

329
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,160
- That auntie is here, too.
- They both brought their daughters.

330
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,460
I see.

331
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,480
Then I will tell them about Yi Chen.

332
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,340
Will Yi Chen come tonight?

333
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,192
Whether he comes is up to him.

334
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:29,880
Zheng Lin, after all, you are father and son.

335
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,200
Stop making your relationship so tense.

336
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,540
He said he would bring his girlfriend.

337
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,160
I'd like to see if he has the guts.

338
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,520
Zheng Lin.

339
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,380
Don't disrupt the celebration.

340
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,000
You can talk to your friends later over cocktails.

341
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,880
Okay, I understand.

342
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,240
Mr. Dong.

343
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,800
Let us continue to discuss our plan.

344
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,240
President Gu is here.

345
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,456
Mr. Gu.

346
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,912
But their relationship is not very good.

347
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,808
Really?

348
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:14,960
I heard it a long time ago.

349
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,500
Many people know about it.

350
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,180
His father's company still depends on him.

351
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,752
Exactly.

352
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,212
Currently, the mobile game project seems very competitive.

353
00:25:32,212 --> 00:25:34,280
Okay, let's try this project first.

354
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,180
Father.

355
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,520
Okay, I'll leave you.

356
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,000
Don't worry.

357
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,276
Father.

358
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,260
I arrived on time as per your request.

359
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,540
My request?

360
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,980
Did I ask you to only be on time?

361
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,440
You are my son.

362
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,080
I know exactly what you plan to do.

363
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,732
You can't even put up a pretense.

364
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:14,360
Don't think of getting anything else in the future.

365
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,540
I've never thought of getting one thing.

366
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,680
When I studied abroad alone or started a business with Qiao Nan,

367
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,400
I always relied on my own strength and hard work.

368
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,180
Since you're so ambitious,

369
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,648
why do you need Meilin's investment?

370
00:26:30,648 --> 00:26:35,040
I'd like to see how long you and your tofu-stall company

371
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,720
can remain standing!

372
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,260
I was wrong.

373
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,340
I shouldn't have come here today.

374
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,260
You can do what you want with the power you hold.

375
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,492
You'll see with your own eyes

376
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:55,292
that my company will go higher and further.

377
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,760
- Gu Yi Chen, stop there!
- Zheng Lin.

378
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,360
How can you argue with your son today on such an occasion?

379
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,920
Yi Chen! Yi Chen!

380
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,576
Don't come any closer.

381
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,520
Oh no, something happened.

382
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,840
What's wrong, Mi Mi?

383
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,200
<i>I'm not quite sure.</i>

384
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,040
It seems President Gu had a quarrel with his father's current wife.

385
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,376
<i>"His father's current wife"?</i>

386
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:17,760
Isn't that—

387
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,440
<i>President. Gu is very angry.</i>

388
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,800
<i>Senior Nan is here, too.</i>

389
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,804
I'm sorry.

390
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,020
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

391
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,720
But please don't interfere with my life anymore.

392
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,520
But Yi Chen, we are a family.

393
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,760
Since my mother died,

394
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,480
I have had no home.

395
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,960
Gu Yi Chen!

396
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,052
If you still remember how my mother died,

397
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,844
then please don't show up in front of me anymore.

398
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:57,300
I won't interfere with your and my father's life.

399
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,100
Please don't interfere with my life, either.

400
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,480
You and I were never a family.

401
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,720
Oh, no! Sister Xin Ran, something huge is about to happen.

402
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Oh gosh…

403
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,720
Nuan Nuan.

404
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,320
Nuan Nuan, are you sure you're not going?

405
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,520
If you don't go, something is bound to happen.

406
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,140
Look.

407
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,640
- Mi Mi, do you have a dress I can borrow?
- You don't have to.

408
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Just before I left work,

409
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,720
I saw Senior Qiao Nan leave the dress you tried on with Mr. Gu.

410
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,880
<i>It's at the front desk.</i>

411
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,720
<i>There was also a pair of brand-new high heels at the front desk.</i>

412
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,580
- Okay.
- Let's go.

413
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,730
<i>[South Tower]</i>

414
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:21,080
- Yi Chen!
- How did it get that physical?

415
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,520
- They don't seem to get along.
- Yes.

416
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,520
This is too inappropriate. He shouldn't have done that.

417
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,640
So many people saw it.

418
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,280
- How could he do that?
- It's a disgrace to the family.

419
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,560
With this slap from you,

420
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,160
now, we are no longer father and son.

421
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,072
From now on, I am no longer your son.

422
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:51,220

423
