00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,060
and complete my own project.

162
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:05,628
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

163
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,360
Do you know the company

164
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,580
adjusted working hours

165
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,980
during the project rush period?

166
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,300
During the project rush, you can't be late to work.

167
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,060
Didn't you see it?

168
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,580
There's this rule too?

169
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,980
Of course.

170
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,300
Ignoring the company's communication

171
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,660
doesn't mean the company didn't make the request.

172
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,740
The requests must be completed on time.

173
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,860
It seems you only care about original art studio's work.

174
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,940
You haven't heeded the company's basic requirements.

175
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:48,960
I, the highest-level special assistant to Z Mobile Games' president,

176
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,520
can only reluctantly apply to your supervisor

177
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,540
to deduct two days' wages as a warning.

178
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,340
Again?

179
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,560
Fine, Assistant Sheng.

180
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,480
<i>Boss, isn't this girl just too cute?</i>

181
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,660
When it comes to work, she actually believes everything.

182
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,540
Assistant Sheng.

183
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,520
Did you forget to give me the legend project's big data report?

184
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,500
Data from the foreign server was uploaded yesterday.

185
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,080
And I was busy with the Digital Expo yesterday.

186
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,500
I didn't put it together yet.

187
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,560
Put it on my desk today at 3 p.m.

188
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,960
A-All of it?

189
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,460
One minute late and deduct two months' salary.

190
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,440
Seriously?

191
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,440
A big data analysis report takes at least a week to complete.

192
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,820
You want me to hand it in at 3 p.m. today?

193
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,200
Boss, you aren't that cruel, right?

194
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,960
Yes, I'm just that cruel.

195
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,460
Boss!

196
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,560
Gu Yi Chen!

197
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,440
President Gu!

198
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:09,916
Come in.

199
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:14,600
Assistant Sheng, here are 39 statistics from seven projects.

200
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,380
The number of people, flow, and turnover are all sorted into categories.

201
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,940
Data from ten more major projects will be sent here this afternoon.

202
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,960
You can review this first.

203
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:26,460
I was wrong.

204
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,960
I was so wrong.

205
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,120
No matter what, I can never step on this guy's minefield again.

206
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,040
And Zhao Nuan Nuan...

207
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,400
Yes, her.

208
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,220
Don't mess with her.

209
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,620
It's okay, I got it. Thank you.

210
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,268
<i>[I like you!]</i>

211
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,460
<i>[Sheng Qiao Nan: President's Special Assistant]</i>

212
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,000
<i>[Let's have lunch together today.]</i>

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,472
<i>[Okay.]</i>

214
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,572
Nuan Nuan.

215
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm sorry, Nuan Nuan.

216
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,544
Actually, I come to this restaurant often.

217
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,920
But their lunch lacks much variety.

218
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,080
So I have to ask you to accompany me to eat simple food.

219
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,880
It's okay, Auntie. I'll eat at Z Mobile Games later.

220
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,700
Anyway, this is very close to Z Mobile Games.

221
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,040
Auntie, you like coming often?

222
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,260
Yes. Just like you said, this place is very close to Z Mobile Games.

223
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,620
I hope you don't mind . I was so presumptuous to ask you out today.

224
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,280
You also know that the relationship between Yi Chen and his father is really tense now.

225
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,080
Although they care about each other in their hearts,

226
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,460
neither is willing to yield to the other.

227
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,580
As his stepmother, I really have no choice.

228
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,740
I have no choice but to meet you secretly behind Yi Chen's back.

229
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,060
Auntie, if you have something to say, talk directly.

230
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,420
If I can help, I will.

231
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,156
What's going on? It's this late, yet she's not here?

232
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,880
<i>Hello, the number you dialed is currently busy.</i>

233
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,620
<i>Please try again later. Sorry.</i>

234
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,584
I can't believe you dare hang up on me, Zhao Nuan Nuan.

235
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,320
<i>[I have an appointment. I can't lunch with you.]</i>

236
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,980
I came to see you regarding Yi Chen and his father.

237
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,780
You saw it with your own eyes,

238
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,960
how far their father-son relationship declined.

239
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,004
I've watched them quarrel 1-2 decades.

240
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:48,040
Although I'm Yi Chen's stepmother, I hope the family remains intact.

241
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,860
I also hope Zheng Lin can enjoy old age in peace

242
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,820
and the family can be together.

243
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,300
But

244
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,280
about Yi Chen...

245
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,380
Yi Chen never comes home, let alone answers my calls.

246
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,644
So I have no opportunity to sit down and talk to him at all.

247
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:16,860
I just ask you to help me persuade him

248
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,448
and ask him to find time to go home and see his dad.

249
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:23,060
After all, his dad is older now.

250
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,108
I'm worried his child never comes home,

251
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:29,660
and what if, what if one day...

252
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,580
<i>Although Yi Chen rarely mentions his parents,</i>

253
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,380
<i>his stepmother seems to love him very much.</i>

254
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,880
Auntie, don't worry,

255
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,620
I will find a time to talk to Yi Chen.

256
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,760
But I don't know if he'll listen to me.

257
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,260
After all, his temper...

258
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,612
Actually, he's not targeting you on purpose.

259
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:16,720
You know his temper.

260
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,664
Maybe it's just a thing he can't get past

261
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,840
so he's always at odds with his father.

262
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,560
I've never blamed him.

263
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,488
But Nuan Nuan, Auntie can see it now.

264
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:30,132
Yi Chen really likes you.

265
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:32,980
He'll definitely listen to what you say.

266
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,312
Please, help me to persuade him.

267
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:38,780
Let him go home and settle down sooner.

268
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,720
But Auntie, I...

269
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,280
Yi Chen?

270
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,500
Yi Chen.

271
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,160
What are you doing here?

272
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,360
I...

273
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,280
Yi Chen, don't blame Nuan Nuan.

274
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,180
I asked her to come.

275
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,352
Come with me.

276
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:00,280
- Gu Yi Chen.
- Wait a minute, Yi Chen.

277
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,944
Stay away from me,

278
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,044
if you don't want me to faint here.

279
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:08,212
Why are you being like this? It's already been so many years.

280
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:10,844
- Can't you—
- No.

281
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,960
Gu Yi Chen, you can't be like this.

282
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,740
She's your elder, your father's wife,

283
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,304
and your...

284
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,680
What are you talking about?

285
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,720
Gu Yi Chen, don't be like this.

286
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,140
Why do you always...

287
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:38,720
Yi Chen.

288
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm sorry, Auntie.

289
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:48,836
Gu Yi Chen.

290
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,772
Gu Yi Chen!

291
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,770
<i>[Z.M.G. Tech.com]</i>

292
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,660
What are you doing?

293
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,540
This is a happy situation.

294
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,580
Can't you see?

295
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,228
I can't stand you. You're so annoying.

296
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:24,400
Aren't you the same?

297
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,080
Did you get back together with Ming Yang?

298
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,940
I heard his call asking you to go to his studio.

299
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,208
Don't talk nonsense.

300
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,752
Ming Yang and I... I am his older sister, just like Nuan Nuan.

301
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,040
Do you think I'd believe that?

302
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,204
You!

303
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,120
Nuan Nuan, you're here.

304
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,560
Nuan Nuan, should we have dinner together tonight?

305
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,080
What's wrong with her? Could it be that Ming Yang—

306
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,796
Have you seen Gu Yi Chen?

307
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,900
President Gu? Didn't you see him?

308
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,880
Did he not come to the office?

309
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,072
It's okay.

310
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:23,896
Zhao Nuan Nuan, I see you've made it all the way to the president's office.

311
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:27,180
Why don't you just beg me, to transfer you back?

312
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,992
Gu Yi Chen...

313
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:31,100
Is President Gu in there?

314
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,380
Isn't he with you?

315
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,412
Why are you looking for him here?

316
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:37,660
It's already 3 p.m. Hasn't he come back yet?

317
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,884
Wait a moment, what happened between you two at noon?

318
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:44,092
I ran into Gu Yi Chen's stepmother.

319
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:47,248
While I had lunch with her, Gu Yi Chen suddenly appeared.

320
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:48,820
"Stepmother"?

321
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,384
You mean, the current wife of Yi Chen's father?

322
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:56,972
Oh, no.

323
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:58,600
What's wrong?

324
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:02,400
Zhao Nuan Nuan, I'll go to Uncle Gu's house. You go to Yi Chen's house.

325
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,888
Remember, you must not call him.

326
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:07,240
The more you contact him, the more he'll avoid us.

327
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,740
Once we lose contact with him, it'll really be troublesome.

328
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,120
Okay.

329
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,480
Gu Yi Chen. Gu Yi Chen.

330
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,840
Gu Yi Chen, are you home?

331
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,260
Gu Yi Chen!

332
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:37,680
Gu Yi Chen.

333
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:40,430
Gu Yi Chen.

334
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,680
Gu Yi Chen.

335
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,720
Gu Yi Chen.

336
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,024
Where did he go?

337
00:22:53,024 --> 00:22:56,200
He won't answer the phone or see me.

338
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,140
Not a single word from him.

339
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,080
Gu Yi Chen.

340
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,584
<i>[Sheng Qiao Nan]</i>

341
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,520
<i>Hello, Nuan Nuan. I suddenly remembered a place.</i>

342
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,576
Yi Chen might be there.

343
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:12,320
Where? I'll go and find him.

344
00:23:37,572 --> 00:23:39,120
Don't move.

345
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,980
Gu Yi Chen, it's me.

346
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,568
I know it's you.

347
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:46,600
Don't move. Don't come near me.

348
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,380
Don't be like this.

349
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,120
I always thought you were different from others.

350
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,200
It seems there's no difference.

351
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,160
In your heart, I'm just a freak, right?

352
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,260
It's not like that.

353
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,040
So what am I in your heart?

354
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,080
The boss of Z Mobile Games? Or...

355
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,072
Gu Yi Chen,

356
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,972
I'm sorry.

357
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:22,780
I shouldn't have gone to see your stepmother without telling you.

358
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,620
But you have to believe me.

359
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,556
I really didn't mean any harm,

360
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:30,080
and it's surely not because of what she said...

361
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,220
Yi Chen,

362
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,084
don't be angry, okay?

363
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:46,860
What exactly happened back then?

364
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,968
Are... you willing to tell me?

365
00:24:57,692 --> 00:25:00,920
Okay, it's fine if you don't want to tell me.

366
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,640
I can wait until you want to speak.

367
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,960
You can tell me then.

368
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,696
Then I'll go back first.

369
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:11,944
Tell Qiao Nan and the others...

370
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:34,920
Back then, my mother didn't divorce him for emotional differences.

371
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,220
It was because she found out

372
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:43,004
that she had sent her best friend to my father's side to help his career,

373
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:45,260
and she never thought that

374
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,580
it would become the last straw to break their relationship.

375
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:55,200
That year, I turned 9 years old.

376
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,764
My father was away from home three full months.

377
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,600
I looked forward to his return on my birthday.

378
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,444
I never expected a heated argument between him and my mother,

379
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:11,888
and my mom's stubborn departure.

380
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:15,680
<i>If you still had a bit of us in your mind, you wouldn't have waited until today to return.</i>

381
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,824
<i>Am I late coming back? Today is Yi Chen's birthday.</i>

382
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:20,668
<i>Don't make a fuss, okay?</i>

383
00:26:20,668 --> 00:26:22,620
<i>I'm already having a very hard time working away from home.</i>

384
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,340
<i>"A hard time"? Are you having a hard time working there,</i>

385
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,560
<i>or being with someone else and hiding it from me and your son?</i>

386
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,120
<i>Can you stop saying this all the time?</i>

387
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,340
<i>Nothing goes on between me and Ling Mei!</i>

388
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,376
<i>"Ling Mei"? You call her so affectionately.</i>

389
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,240
<i>Gu Zheng Lin, I'll make it clear.</i>

390
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,120
<i>Ling Mei is my best friend, not yours.</i>

391
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,680
<i>Yes, I never considered her a friend.</i>

392
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,432
<i>She's a worker I supervise.</i>

393
00:26:44,432 --> 00:26:45,632
<i>What's wrong with calling her Ling Mei?</i>

394
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,832
<i>Would you be satisfied if I called her "Accountant Li" or "Director Li"?</i>

395
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:52,700
<i>You care so much how she's called, but when have you ever cared about me?</i>

396
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,680
<i>You're being unreasonable!</i>

397
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,556
<i>I don't want to argue another word.</i>

398
00:26:56,556 --> 00:26:58,620
<i>After celebrating the boy's birthday, I'll leave instantly.</i>

399
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,160
<i>We don't need you to celebrate his birthday.</i>

400
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,400
<i>He doesn't have a father like you.</i>

401
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,600
<i>What did you say? Get out of the way.</i>

402
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,520
<i>He doesn't have a father like you!</i>

403
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,060
<i>You and your dear Ling Mei will never see him again!</i>

404
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,400
<i>He's my son. I'll take him with me.</i>

405
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,260
<i>Mom, Dad.</i>

406
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,560
<i>You don't have a dad anymore. Come with me.</i>

407
00:27:18,524 --> 00:27:21,052
<i>Dad. Dad!</i>

408
00:27:21,052 --> 00:27:25,500
<i>Mom. Dad! Dad!</i>

409
00:27:28,704 --> 00:27:30,480
<i>Dad.</i>

410
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,900
<i>Dad.</i>

411
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,180
<i>- Lin Yuan, this is very dangerous.
- Dad. Dad!</i>

412
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,020
<i>Right now, I don't want another second with you.</i>

413
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,960
<i>President Gu, Sister Yuan, what's going on?</i>

414
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
<i>Sister Yuan, get out of the car.</i>

415
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,608
<i>- Let's talk outside the car.
- Dad.</i>

416
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:54,160
<i>I have nothing to say to you.</i>

417
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,860
<i>- Let's talk outside the car!
- Dad.</i>

418
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,184
<i>Get out of the car first, Sister Yuan.</i>

419
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:59,460
<i>Let's talk outside the car.</i>

420
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,180
<i>President Gu, this could lead to big trouble.</i>

421
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,780
<i>Yi Chen, always remember who pushed us to this point.</i>

422
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,960
<i>They betrayed us.</i>

423
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,180
<i>If something happens to me, never forgive him!</i>

424
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,320
<i>Dad.</i>

425
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,320
<i>- Dad.
- "Dad"? You don't have a dad!</i>

426
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,300
<i>You don't have a dad anymore.</i>

427
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,128
<i>Yi Chen, we have nothing left.</i>

428
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,320
<i>Dad.</i>

429
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,500
<i>Mom. Mom, wake up.</i>

430
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,540
<i>Mom. Mom!</i>

431
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,620
<i>Mom.</i>

432
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,320
<i>Mom, wake up!</i>

433
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,760
<i>Mom. Mom!</i>

434
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:17,040
<i>- Yi Chen.
- Mom.</i>

435
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,000
<i>Mom, don't leave me.</i>

436
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,300
<i>I might not make it.</i>

437
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,860
<i>- Mom.
- Remember what I said.</i>

438
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,220
<i>- Never rely on him.
- Mom.</i>

439
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,420
<i>Don't forgive him.</i>

440
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,740
<i>Never, ever.</i>

<i>Mom.</i>

443
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,450
<i>- Don't scare me, Mom.
- Sister Yuan! Sister Yuan, hold on.</i>

444
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,856
<i>- Mom, wake up.
- Sister Yuan, wake up.</i>

445
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:44,020
<i>- Mom.
- Sister Yuan. Sister Yuan!</i>

446
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,000
<i>- Don't leave me.
- Sister Yuan, I've already called for help.</i>

447
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,380
<i>- Yi Chen. Yi Chen.
- Mom!</i>

448
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,500
<i>Sister Yuan! Sister Yuan, wake up.</i>

<i>Sister Yuan!</i>

450

It's all in the past, Yi Chen.

451
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:11,740
It's okay now.

452
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,576
You won't get hurt again.

453
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:17,440
And no one will ever be able to hurt you again.

454
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,620
I will always be with you.

455

Yi Chen.

456
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:24,828
I'll always be by your side.

457
00:31:10,044 --> 00:31:13,320
Go back. Be careful on the road.

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,564
Why thank me?

461
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:31,828
I should apologize to you.

462
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:34,520
I went to see your family without your permission,

463
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,580
and I made you upset.

464
00:31:37,152 --> 00:31:39,612
I haven't thought of these things for years.
