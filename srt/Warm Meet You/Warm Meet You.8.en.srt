It was urgent. I didn't have time to tell you; I just...

Why did he faint? Is it hypoglycemia?

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,840
Should we do cardiac resuscitation for him? Or artificial respiration?

Are you crazy? You can't touch him now!

- Okay, see you later.

Zheng Lin, how did your talk with your son go?

67
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,324
Don't mention that unfilial son to me again.

68
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:28,180
From now on, you're not allowed to involve him!

69
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,080
What kind of angry words are those?

70
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,600
After all, he is your biological son.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,220
Just treat him like he died with his mother back then. He's dead.

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,020
Are you angry with me?

73
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,572
I know that if it weren't for me back then,

74
00:04:50,572 --> 00:04:52,828
Yi Chen's mom wouldn't have died,

75
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:55,156
and Yi Chen wouldn't have gotten this strange disease.

76
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:59,680
And if not for me, you and he wouldn't have such a rift.

77
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,180
It's all my fault.

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,212
If it weren't for my entry into this family,

79
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:08,400
it wouldn't have turned out like this, with father and son fighting.

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,580

- Of course, he's not.

One minute you want me to stay, and the next you don't want me near.

You want me to pretend to be your girlfriend,

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,992
Isn't it cute?

161
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,340
Assistant Sheng said you weren't feeling well

162
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,400
so I bought some things on the way.

163
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,680
I'll cook you porridge. Maybe it will help you feel better.

164
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,060
Can you cook porridge?

165
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,740
Of course. I'm the top chef under my mother.

166
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:34,024
What's this?

167
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:37,752
President Gu...

168
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,944
The milk is mine.

169
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:43,860
Clearly, I was the one who gave it to you.

170
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,460
It's mine.

171
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,060
You…

172
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,060
Gu Yi Chen, since this morning at the office,

173
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,240
I have been wondering what happened to you.

174
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,860
Why have you seemed a little odd

175
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,520
since the first time you saw me?

176
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,784
And why did you faint?

177
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:17,864
Could it really be because of that

178
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,576
kiss?

179
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:25,880
Was it really because that was your first kiss?

180
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:42,120
No way?

181
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,200
No.

182
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,480
Why not ask someone else?

183
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,520
<i>It's delicious.</i>

184
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,280
<i>Just make a few more phone calls and ask around.</i>

185
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,180
<i>Don't worry about the hassle.</i>

186
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm off work now, Sister Xin Ran. See you tomorrow.

187
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,280
- Bye bye.
- Mi Mi, this isn't done yet.

188
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,700
<i>[Z.M.G. Tech.com]</i>

189
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,980
- Go home and wait for my call.
- Okay.

190
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,640
<i>- I'll send it to you when I'm done.
- Okay.</i>

191
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,288
- Are you off?
- I'm working overtime.

192
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:13,344
- Have you...
- I don't have time.

193
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,260
Allergic to being touched by females?

194
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,524
What kind of strange disease is this?

195
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:37,220
So you also think it's a strange disease.

196
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,220
N-No.

197
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,340
In my father's eyes and everyone else, who hears about this disease,

198
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,244
they feel I'm a freak with a strange disease.

199
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:52,636
I got this disease after my mother passed away.

200
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:56,228
The worst was when I couldn't breathe

201
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,840
due to the allergy, and even my heart almost stopped.

202
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,940
<i>Yi Chen, surprise!</i>

203
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,040
<i>Luo Yi?</i>

204
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,640
<i>Aren't you happy? I flew back from California just to see you.</i>

205
00:15:19,456 --> 00:15:21,920
<i>Yi Chen, what's wrong? Yi Chen?</i>

206
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,000
<i>- Yi Chen, what's wrong?
- Stay away from me. Don't come near me!</i>

207
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,740
<i>- Are you all right?
- Stay away from me.</i>

208
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,672
<i>Don't come near.</i>

209
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,100
<i>Yi Chen?</i>

210
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,204
<i>Yi Chen?</i>

211
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,632
<i>Yi Chen, are you all right?</i>

212
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:44,140
<i>Yi Chen, wake up! Yi Chen!</i>

213
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,260
No way.

214
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,360
That's why my office has an unspoken rule of not allowing unknown women to come in.

215
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,460
It's not because I have any prejudice against women,

216
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,940
but because of my allergies.

217
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,320
Due to this strange disease, I was at odds with my father for more than a decade.

218
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,640
I also can't get close to those aunties who care about me.

219
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,400
When at a family gathering, I can only watch them from a distance.

220
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,700
I can't get closer.

221
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,320
Because once I get close to them, my allergy reacts.

222
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,720
Over the years,

223
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,540
I have been alone;

224
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,560
I eat alone, work alone,

225
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,760
and live alone.

226
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,380
For everything, I have only myself.

227
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,556
But why did I...

228
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,220
<i>Oh my.</i>

229
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,860
<i>I even wanted to share his good luck,</i>

230
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,280
<i>and I...</i>

231
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,200
You're the exception. I'm not allergic to you.

232
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:54,264
Why?

233
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,760
The last time we met in the hotel, you put a sticky note on my face.

234
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,380
But it didn't trigger my allergy.

235
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,500
That time at the hotel?

236
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,624
My psychologist said you may have some kind of feature

237
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:14,300
or lack a feature so you don't trigger my allergies.

238
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,920
Lacking?

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,720
So am I lacking something?

240
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,496
Is it that you're not feminine enough?

241
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,944
Thank you for the compliment, President Gu.

242
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:38,320
What are you doing?

243
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,240
Bringing you the porridge, CEO Gu.

244
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,520
Boss, why don't you just rent it to us?

245
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,900
That's really not possible.

246
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,720
Why isn't she here yet?

247
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,920
Boss, can we rent your studio for ¥50,000?

248
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,480
But ¥50,000 won't do. I'm sorry.

249
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,736
Haven't you eaten? Why are you eating this?

250
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,040
It's good.

251
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,140
I passed a very good dumpling shop on my way home.

252
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,720
I won't eat that..

253
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,000
This place is famous. Try the dumplings.

254
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,804
I won't.

255
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,220
All right then.

256
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:57,080
Are they delicious?

257
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,380
Here, here.

258
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:07,800
Choking on your food?

259
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,940
You're like a child.

260
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:19,720
What's wrong?

261
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,260
It's all because you walked in silently. You startled me.

262
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,640
Who just said he didn't want to eat these?

263
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,372
Then you ate them.

264
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:32,260
You're just like a child.

265
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,480
Who is a child? I'm a man.

266
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,860
You're not even as old as Zhao Nuan Nuan,

267
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,084
and you dare call yourself a man?

268
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:42,380
I'm only a minute younger than her.

269
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,300
It doesn't matter how many minutes younger you are.

270
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,712
Nuan Nuan calls me "Senior Sister."

271
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:49,280
And you?

272
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:52,324
I'd like to hear that from you.

273
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:10,960
♫ <i>The road to your heart is so long</i> ♫

274
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,120
What were you just look... looking at?

275
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,320
Recently, I've been searching for a workspace.

276
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,208
The project for Z Mobile Games is about to end.

277
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:26,540
I plan to lead my own team and start our own studio.

278
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,320
Is this how you look for a place?

279
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,444
These are all pictures posted by agents.

280
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:37,236
Many are fake listings.

281
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:41,860
You won't see the huge difference between this and the actual location until you get there.

282
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,740
You're absolutely right.

283
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,116
I've been running around all day, and my legs are sore,

284
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:49,540
but I didn't find one suitable place.

285
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,280
Do you need my help?

286
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
Can you help me find a suitable place?

287
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,020
If you can help us establish our studio,

288
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,660
I…

289
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,040
I will continue to give you 24-hour service,

290
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,784
the personal kind.

291
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,340
<i>Thank you, Sir.</i>

292
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:31,800
<i>Sir, Sir. Please stop.</i>

293
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,964
Hello. I've arrived.

294
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:37,440
It will take me a few minutes to walk in.

295
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,160
See you soon.

296
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:51,880
You!

297
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,100
Come here.

298
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,760
What a coincidence, Senior Qiao Nan.

299
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,280
How many times have I told you not to follow me?

300
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,124
Didn't I make it clear to you that time in the garage?

301
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:26,780
But, Senior Qiao Nan, you're not keeping your word.

302
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,080
How am I not keeping my word?

303
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,820
Last time, you clearly said that if I solved that astrophysics problem,

304
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,100
you would let me confess to you.

305
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,660
You reneged.

306
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,504
Did you solve that problem on your own?

307
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:42,200
It was friends, seniors, and even your dad who helped you.

308
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,040
And does it make any difference if you confess or not?

309
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,120
Even if you confess once or ten times,

310
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,092
I will never accept you.

311
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,612
Then I'll confess a hundred more times.

312
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,120
Senior Qiao Nan, I like you!

313
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,540
I like you! I like you.

314
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Okay, enough. Stop causing trouble.

315
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,240
I tell you. I have something very important to do today.

316
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,952
So I cannot leave until very late.

317
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:18,020
Right now, immediately, you need to go home.

318
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,820
What kind of porridge is this?

319
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,456
It's a healthy porridge recipe from my family.

320
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:49,800
It's made out of 18 ingredients.

321
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,420
It has very nutritious Chongcao (caterpillar fungus) powder,

322
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,120
donkey-hide gelatin, and brown sugar.

323
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,080
Whenever I was sick as a child,

324
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,480
my mother cooked this all-round nutritious porridge for me.

325
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,832
Just eat a bowl while it's still hot, and you'll feel better.

326
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,620
Don't scorn it.

327
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,040
Although it looks ordinary on the outside,

328
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,800
the taste is really good.

329
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,340
Have a taste.

330
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:31,320
Okay.

331
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,592
How is it? Isn't it delicious?

332
00:25:42,592 --> 00:25:45,388
Aren't all your illnesses cured?

333
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,940
It... it's okay.

334
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,960
Really? It's really good?

335
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,160
Then I'll also have a bowl.

336
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,960
You'd better not have any.

337
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,380
Why?

338
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,800
I am my mother's top disciple, you know.

339
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:08,580
What's going on?

340
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:12,140
The power is out.

341
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,180
No way.

342
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,420
Even your home can have a power outage?

343
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,620
My home is also on Earth.

344
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,540
That's true.

345
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,560
Sit tight. I'll go get the toolbox.

346
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,160
What are you getting the toolbox for?

347
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,516
To repair the circuit.

348
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,340
No way. Me?

349
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,920
Usually, if Qiao Nan is here, he would do this.

350
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,080
Or do you want me to do it?

351
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,960
Zhao Nuan Nuan, I am your boss.

352
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,100
<i>Yes, you are my boss,</i>

353
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,480
<i>but you're a man!</i>

354
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,844
<i>Making a girl fix the circuit?</i>

355
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:29,368
<i>Are you even human?</i>

356
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:31,072
<i>Have you any humanity?</i>

357
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:34,696
<i>Won't you uphold your status as a boss?</i>

358
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,076
Here.

359
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:47,624
Hurry. Go.

360
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:01,260
Sister...

361
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:04,680
I do like older women.

362
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,564
Senior Nan,

363
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:02,224
I like you.

364
00:30:02,224 --> 00:30:04,232
Do you know that?

365
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,744
Gu Yi Chen, I really misjudged you.

366
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:27,928
I thought you had changed recently,

367
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:29,520
and that your temper wasn't as bad.

368
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,340
Yet you're still an inhumane CEO.

369
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,760
You're actually asking me, a fragile girl, to fix the circuit.

370
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,800
You're still the same capricious boss who bullies me,

371
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,580
won't trust me, and bosses me around ever since we met.

372
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,340
Although I'm just your hired girlfriend,

373
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,560
who would ask his girlfriend to fix the circuit?

374
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,360
You are a man unmatched in the universe for a one-track mind.

375
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,720
You're destined to be alone.

376
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,000
Can you see clearly?

377
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,860
No… Yes, I can see.

378
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,880
Do you know how to fix it?

379
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,200
I don't.

380
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,820
Let me do it.
