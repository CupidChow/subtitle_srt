how could I make my female protagonist look more beautiful?

Ming Yang, you wait at the elevator doors.

161
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,200
I'll check their room number at the front desk.

162
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Do we need to tell Mr. Gu?

163
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,440
Some problems can only be resolved by the people involved.

164

I really look forward to tonight's performance.

168
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,900
Many comedians have come, and it must be very interesting.

169

I'm also excited for the concert tonight.

170
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,360
I heard there are several famous bands.

171

Nuan Nuan, what are you looking forward to?

172

177

182
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:54,160
Sweet and funny?

183
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,660
Really looking forward to it?

184
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,380
Oh, no.

185
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,344

My super stand-up comedy.

188
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,620
Just forget it.

189
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:23,720
Had I known, I wouldn't have taken Senior Nan's call.

190
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,840
Men are such a hassle!

191
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,400
But if they won't let us join the themed party, I have other fun stuff.

192
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,380
Mi Mi, you're like a Doraemon (robot cat's gadgets).

193
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,860
Of course,

194
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,100
coming for a vacation and still being bossed is so annoying.

195
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,800
Without a party or stand-up comedy,

196
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,856
let's drink as much as desired.

197
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:54,100
This alcohol is very strong.

198
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,980
What's there to fear? We have bodyguards.

199
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,100
Here, the first drink is to celebrate our happy vacation.

200
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,520
Nuan Nuan, you really can drink without getting drunk.

201
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,840
Nuan Nuan, this drink can get you drunk easily.

202
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,556
Take it slow.

203
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:28,056
Okay.

204
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,700
Second round: here's to Nuan Nuan's recent lucky streak.

205

You can drink for me.

You girls will easily get drunk like this.

208

I'll order some juice for you.
