Listen to my explanation!

162
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,620
President Gu, how about a duel of "Legend of the Mighty"?

163
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,700
The loser washes dishes.

164
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,500
Let's do it; I'm not scared.

165
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,964
Start.

166
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,360
Really?

167
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,620
The big boss of Z Mobile Games is only at Level 5?

168
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,160
That's because as mobile game company boss,

169
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,400
I'm upright, and my account is legitimate.

170
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,260
I never take shortcuts to add HP (hit points) and XP (experience).

171
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,020
Today, I finally understand.

172
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,980
- What?
- What it means to speak nonsense with a straight face.

173
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,840
Hurry up.

174
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,800
I fear someone will say I'm bullying the newbie.

175
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
I'll give you two pieces of equipment.

176
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
No need.

177
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,400
My fault. One more round.

178
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,400
Don't use the blade!

179
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,520
Don't cut there!

180
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,600
Do you know how to play it? Have you ever played this?

181
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,080
I said don't use the blade. It won't even scratch.

182
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,840
Right.

183
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,280
I almost fought you barehanded, and you still lost.

184
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,660
With your skills, you might as well say goodbye to mobile games.

185
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,260
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

186
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,060
What?

187
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,880
This mobile game is produced by my company,

188
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,500
and unfortunately, I seem to be the biggest boss of this company.

189
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,040
And even more unfortunately,

190
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,940
I seem to be the boyfriend you've just gotten together with.

191
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,100
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

192
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,260
<i>Whose opening invitation card is all pink?</i>

193
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,280
<i>I just broke up with my girlfriend,</i>

194
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,560
and I have to send cards to former colleagues.

195
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
Zhao Ming Yang, you're heartless!

196
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,920
Sorry, I didn't see you just now.

197
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,960
You are…

198
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,520
No, it's okay. Goodbye.

199
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,400
Hey, don't go!

200
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,960
- Nuan Nuan.
- Yes?

201
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,360
Many are hand-drawn scenes.

202
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,300
Do you plan to do them all by yourself?

203
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,520
Yes, half of the initial plan is already done.

204
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,100
Two-thirds of the later plan are left.

205
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,360
It seems it will take a few months, or even a year, to complete.

206
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,080
Do you need me to find you help or set up a team?

207
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,400
There's no need.

208
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,640
I can still finish the current hand-drawn scenes myself.

209
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,600
I'll need help in the later modeling program.

210
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,540
Although there are still thousands of them,

211
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,280
this is my dream project, after all.

212
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,360
I hope it can keep the same style

213
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,260
with unified character images done by myself.

214
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,760
Aren't you tired with so much work?

215
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,340
Yes, but I'm on the road to pursue my dream.

216
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,020
Even if it's hard, I'm still happy.

217
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,120
Is it a little too hard to be with me?

218
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,420
I can't be like a normal boyfriend,

219
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,040
who will shop, watch movies, and dine out with you.

220
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,680
I can have you accompany me only at home or work.

221
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,260
Then are you tired to be with me?

222
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,200
After all, I used to be a super-unlucky person.

223
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,380
I would tumble while walking, and drop my phone while riding in a car.

224
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,040
I would even fall and get wet when riding a shared bike.

225
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,600
So for me, going out or not is no difference.

226
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,940
Working and playing games with you at home is safe and warm.

227
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,000
Isn't that good?

228
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,080
I'm not with you for dining out or movies.

229
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,920
I am with you because...

230
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,260
I want to be with you.

231
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,960
Thank you.

232
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,360
And you're still formal with me.

233
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,500
But I forgot to ask,

234
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,060
Has your strange allergy gotten better?

235
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,160
I don't know. It hasn't flared a long time.

236
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,960
Also, I didn't need allergy medication.

237
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,020
The psychiatrist hasn't contacted me for a long time.

238
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,820
Does that mean it's improving?

239
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Although I didn't study medicine, and I'm not a psychiatrist,

240
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,580
I've read many psychology books and online cases.

241
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,560
In fact, special allergies like yours

242
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,200
are caused by psychological reasons.

243
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,940
We can't diagnose the exact cause of your symptoms.

244
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,480
Yi Chen, only you can break through all obstacles.

245
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,680
Nuan Nuan.

246
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,440
I sincerely hope you bravely open your heart,

247
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,320
get closer to the rest of the world and return to the crowd,

248
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,240
like you encourage me to chase my dreams.

249
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,620
You can overcome difficulties and this disease with your own efforts.

250
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,820
I'll always be by your side to keep you company.

251
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,320
I believe you'll surely get better.

252
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,100
So promise me

253
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,040
to work hard together, okay?

254
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,944
Okay.

273
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,560
And I hoped he could return to the crowd.

274
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,100
There seems no hope.

275
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,600
Could it be psychology books are wrong?

276
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,020
If it's a psychological illness,

277
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,040
can't it be treated by gradual desensitization?

278

<i>[Big Sister Xin Ran]</i>

279
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,600
Hello, Big Sister Xin Ran.

280
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,860
Hello, Nuan Nuan.
<i>[Z.M.G. Tech.com]</i>

281
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,420
Are you with President Gu?
<i>[Z.M.G. Tech.com]</i>

282
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,920
I'm not with Yi Chen.

283
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,260
He just went out for a work call.

284
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,100
What's the matter?

285
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,980
Didn't Ming Yang tell you?

286
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,960
His studio opens tonight.

287
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,760
He invited us all to celebrate at his studio.

288
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,000
"Studio"?

289
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,580
That child didn't say a word to me.

290
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,660
<i>Zhao Ming Yang, that brat.</i>

291
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,400
He's getting bolder,

292
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,280
even daring to hide from his own sister.

293
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,180
It's not like that.

294
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,040
Maybe it's really too tough to find a house plus renovate.

295
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,060
<i>Bring President Gu with you later.</i>

296
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,220
Let's celebrate together.

297
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,760
Bring... Yi Chen?

298
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,600
But…

299
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,920
<i>Don't worry.</i>

300
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,820
Ming Yang also invited Assistant Sheng and Mi Mi. Just come together.

301
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,100
- Assistant Sheng, too?
- <i>Yes.</i>

302
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,240
- And Mi Mi, too?
- <i>Yes.</i>

303
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,200
Then there should be no problem.

304
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,840
Big Sister Xin Ran, we'll go.

- It's so beautiful.

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,864
- How do you like it?
- Congratulations.

312
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,720
Yi Chen, don't leave.

313
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,140
I'm not ready yet.

314
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,880
There's nothing to prepare for.

315
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,280
This is Ming Yang's studio.

316
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,020
I know, but...

317
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,220
There's no "but."

318
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,300
We know all the people Ming Yang invited today.

319
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,600
His team members, Assistant Sheng,

320
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,620
and my best friends, Xin Ran and Mi Mi.

321
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,800
You know everyone.

322
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,440
Why do you still want to hide?

323
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,600
I don't want to, but…

324
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,340
There's no "but."

325
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,160
Yi Chen, if you're not allergic to me,

326
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,560
then I believe your allergy can really be cured.

327
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,780
But all these years you have lived in your own circle with Qiao Nan.

328
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,460
Why don't you try to step out a little?

329
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,740
Perhaps, if you interact with more people, everything will get better.

330
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,800
Don't worry, I will be with you.

331
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,360
I'm not afraid of them.

332
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,980
I'm worried if my allergies come back, it will scare them.

333
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,960
Then there's no need to worry.

334
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,000
Everyone inside is our good friend.

335
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,540
There won't be a problem getting along with them, right?

336
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,170
And...

337
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,640
I want to formally introduce you to Ming Yang.

338
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,596
Let's go.

339
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,540
Welcome. Please come in.

340
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,700
- Surprise! Look whom I brought.
- President Gu.

341
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,820
You're really something, Nuan Nuan. You actually brought President Gu.

342
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,260
President Gu of Z Mobile Games.

343
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,200
You came to celebrate our studio's opening, President Gu?

344
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,080
Congratulations, Zhao Ming Yang.

345
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,220
You have finally fulfilled your dream.

346
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,040
You are as amazing as your sister.

347
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,620
What are you waiting for, Brat?

348
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,180
He talks to you; do you ignore him?

349
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,760
Where are your manners?

350
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,980
Did I teach you like this?

351
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,240
You, follow me.

352
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,256
You are being rude!

353
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,360
Yi Chen.

354
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,780
What's going on, Nuan Nuan?

355
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,000
It's okay, Nuan Nuan.

356
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,300
Ming Yang likely just asked President Gu for a few words.

357
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,320
Don't worry.

358
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,220
But... Assistant Sheng.

359
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,660
It's okay. Leave it to me.

360
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,160
Gu Yi Chen.

361
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,920
Say it.

362
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,940
I don't speak as a member of the Z Mobile Games team now.

363
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:28,380
I am speaking to you as Zhao Nuan Nuan's family and protector.

364
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,240
Good.

365
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,000
What is going on between you and Zhao Nuan Nuan?

366
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,220
When did you guys get together?

367
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,280
Who made the first move, who confessed first, and who agreed first?

368
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,920
I'm right next to you.

369
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,180
Why did you two hide it from me?

370
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,460
I got together with Zhao Nuan Nuan last week.

371
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,940
I pursued her first, and I confessed first.

372
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,540
She agreed only the day before yesterday.

373
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,200
Why you have no idea,

374
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,580
you are with Nuan Nuan daily, but you don't know her love-life.

375
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,640
It seems her brother doesn't really care about her.

376
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,680
Now I ask you as the boss of Z Mobile Games,

377
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,280
do you like our company's Wu Xin Ran?

378
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,640
When did it start?

379
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,120
Was it during the collaboration?

380
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,540
Do you know our company's biggest new rule?

381
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,960
What is that?

382
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,260
Office romance is prohibited in the company.

383
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,080
Now, it's your turn.

384
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,840
Ming Yang, if you're a man, you have to drink.

385
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,640
So you like your sister's best friend.

386
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,540
When do you plan to tell her?

387
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,820
Or I can help you.

388
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,940
No, you mustn't tell my sister!

389
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,976
Brother-in-law.

390
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,220
Brother Qiao Nan, Brother-in-law, if you tell my sister now

391
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,060
before I confess my love, I'll be dead.

392
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,640
If you don't tell my sister, I'll do anything.

393
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,740
You want to date my sister, right? She's all yours.

394
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,380
You want me to drink? I'll drink. I'll drink it all.

395
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,880
Don't drink it all; save some for us.

396
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,040
Come on.

397
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,680
Come, let's drink together.

398
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:54,200
Let's drink. No one can leave tonight.

399
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,080
Why is it so quiet?

400
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,160
They didn't start fighting, did they?

401
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,460
<i>Hurry, Old Jin! Bring the keys!</i>

402
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,800
Where are they? How come all three men are gone?

403
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,880
They're so doomed.

404
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,784
<i>What's wrong?</i>

405
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,000
I'll head east.

406
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,240
I'll head west.

407
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,212
I live this way.

408
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,350
