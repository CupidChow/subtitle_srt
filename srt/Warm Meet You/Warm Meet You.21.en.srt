<i>[Episode 21]</i>

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,980
Hello.

28
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,320
<i>Do you want to meet me?</i>

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,380
No.

30
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,260
Not for personal matters, for your Z Mobile Games.

31
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,840
What else do you want?

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,600
I want to be your guiding light.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,320
Sign a cooperation agreement with me.

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,600
I can have UA give you the best treatment.

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,280
<i>I can promise you all the conditions you want,</i>

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,020
as long as you and your Z Mobile Games

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,540
join me.

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,980
<i>Yi Chen, stop being so stubborn.</i>

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,180
Z Mobile Games has developed very well under your authority,

40
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,580
but without strong backing,

41
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,420
and the experience of veteran mobile game manufacturers, you can't continue on.

42
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,760
If your so-called experience is to do everything possible to ruin competitors,

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,300
and take away all their projects and resources,

44
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,500
then sorry, I'm not interested in such a shameless experience!

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,960
Gu Yi Chen.

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,200
<i>Although your cooperation agreement has long expired,</i>

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,940
I tell you that I cooperate with only those who respect the project and the industry.

48
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,320
<i>Yi Chen, think it over.</i>

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,540
Now, only UA and I can save your company.

50
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:21,460
Yi Chen! Ming Yang, what did you do?

51
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,280
Let go of me. Today I want to teach President Gu a lesson.

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,980
He bullied my sister, Zhao Nuan Nuan.

53
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,500
Do you remember what I told you?

54
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,020
I will never let this go.

55
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,840
Ming Yang, use your words.

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,640
My sister was sent away by him. What can I say to such a person?

57
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,580
Your sister left? Where did she go?

58
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,160
Are you asking me? I want to ask you!

59
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,840
Are you happy now? Are you satisfied?

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,460
I tell you. Never let me see you again!

61
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,620

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,300
Dear, this one.

101
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,600
Let me tell you. His family is so rich that two generations can enjoy the wealth.

102
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,820
What's so great about having money?

103
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,920
Our Nuan Nuan doesn't lack money.

104
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,120
<i>Then this one, born to a family of doctors and has a doctorate degree.</i>

105
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,380
Right, a family of doctors and nurses.

106
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,900
Future medical treatments and injections can be guaranteed.

107
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,320
Right.

108
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,840
My daughter isn't marrying to get medical treatment!

109
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,720
Dear, what do you think of that young man outside?

110
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,800
I don't think much of him.

111
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,060
He's so handsome, and you're still picky.

112
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,120
Our Nuan Nuan doesn't just value looks.

113
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,540
I'll tell you something.

114
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,680
When choosing a son-in-law, you must value his character.

115
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,780
He has to be good to my daughter, truly love my daughter,

116
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,960
<i>and not hide anything from her.</i>

117
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,580
He must be sincere to my daughter.

118
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,440
In short, if he sincerely loves my daughter,

119
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,180
I can be a satisfied mother-in-law.

120
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,480
If he openly or secretly bullies my daughter,

121
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,340
I will teach him a lesson as Mother-in-law.

122
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,720
What does he do?

123
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,500
He runs a seafood business at home.

124
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,300
Here's your water. Are you from out of town?

125
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,600
Uncle.

126
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,140
If you don't mind, would you join me for a drink later?

127
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,300
But I drove here.

128
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,920
What does it matter? If you get drunk, stay here.

129
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
Wait, I'll get the wine.

130
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
I prepared in a rush.

131
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,860
I haven't made any good dishes to serve you.

132
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,200
It's already very good.

133
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,900
No problem, there's more.

134
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,500
Children's mother (Dear).

135
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,560
I'm coming, coming.

136
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,040
What are you shouting for?

137
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,800
It's so cold, yet you're making him drink. So silly.

138
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
Drink if you want. Why do I have to serve you?

139
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,040
Here's your squirrel-shaped mandarin fish and salted duck.

140
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,620
My wife is the best. My wife is the best.

141
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,140
You dare to drink.

142
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,740
You're even drinking cold wine on a cold day.

143
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,980
Wait, I'll warm it for you.

144
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,100
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Okay, okay.

145
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,720
Don't mind what she said.

146
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,720
She's always like this. Her words are harsh, but her heart is soft.

147
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,540
She doesn't display affection,

148
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,240
but just keeps it in her heart for a lifetime.

149
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,400
Auntie is so nice.

150
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,080
Is that so?

151
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,760
Actually, let me tell you; all parents are the same.

152
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,160
At first, they hope their children will be successful.

153
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,820
Later on, they hope their children can have a better life.

154
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,320
In the end, they all hope their children can be happy.

155
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,140
Sometimes, when they blame you or don't understand you,

156
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,040
their love for you makes them emotional.

157
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,480
They're afraid that you'll make the same mistakes

158
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,768
that they did before.

159
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,200
So from the moment you were born,

160
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,060
they've been carefully protecting you.

161
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,020
When you grow up,

162
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,420
they hope you can have a better life than they did.

163
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,480
In this world, parents love their child.

164
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,360
No parents want to become enemies with their child.

165
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,460
When they hit or scold you,

166
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,040
the ones who hurt most are the parents.

167
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,500
I have two children about your age.

168
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,040
I won't discuss my son. That rascal does whatever he wants.

169
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,040
He would dare to do anything.

170
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,200
But my daughter…

171
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,260
Do you want to hear about my daughter?

172
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,960
I want to hear.

173
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,200
My daughter has been a very lovely child since childhood.

174
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,260
She was chubby, fair and charming.

175
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,980
But she always had bad luck.

176
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,560
However, no matter what misfortunes occur,

177
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,920
she is always optimistic and kind.

178
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,940
Actually, I never thought my daughter was unlucky.

179
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,020
Even though some setbacks and difficulties are in her life,

180
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,100
I believe she can use her wisdom, kindness, and innocence

181
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,260
to resolve these issues one by one.

182
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,700
In fact, no one in this world has everything go well.

183
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,740
Likewise, no one is always at the bottom of the heap.

184
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,340
What distinguishes people is how you respond to issues.

185
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,340
Some people pull themselves together

186
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,600
to have a better life.

187
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,820
But some people crumble.

188
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,200
For such people, none of us can help them, right?

189
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,310
So

190
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,000
I hope you can be like her. Pull yourself together and start over.

191
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,836
Here.

192
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Here, eat.

193

Don't just chat.

No.

After your fight,

220
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:01,394
you haven't talked to him or called him?

221
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:06,034
This won't do. You should talk to each other.

222

I know what he's thinking.

223
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:14,214
He must think that I did it on purpose,

224
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:16,334
and he must blame me.

225
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:20,754
He thought that I deliberately took him to the porridge shop to see his mother.

226
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:25,254
But I really didn't know about it.

227
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:33,372
I also didn't know he had so much pain in his past.

00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:35,774
In fact, I don't blame him.

229

It's all my fault.

230
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:41,554
I've never tried to understand him.

231
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:47,614
I've never known what he truly wants.

232
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:52,934
All I knew was to pursue him desperately, forcing him to accept me.

233
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:59,234
If I had known our relationship was doomed to end,

234
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:02,614
then it would have been better not to start.

00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:59,774
After leaving home once, she's become fearless.

323
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:02,154
When she gets back…

324
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:14,334
Oh, no. I forgot my key.

325
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:17,214
I wonder if Big Sister Xin Ran and Ming Yang are home.

326
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,934
What do I do if they're not?

327
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,684
Nuan Nuan.

328
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:38,794
<i>I want to turn you into a tiny pocket cat</i>

329
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:40,636
<i>and carry you in my pocket daily.</i>

330
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:44,234
<i>So anytime, anywhere,</i>

331
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:48,274
<i>I can see you whenever I want to.</i>

332
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:49,784
<i>Meow.</i>

333
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:55,254
<i>Yi Chen, I like you</i>

334
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:59,394
<i>very, very, very much.</i>

335
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:02,094
Nuan Nuan.

336
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:05,994
Nuan Nuan.

337
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:11,114
No way.

338
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:14,390
Dior's

339
00:26:15,014 --> 00:26:17,354
999 lipstick.

340
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,588
Is Nuan Nuan still not back? Give her a call.

341
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:24,314
S-Still not back.

342
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:33,574
What kind of posture is this?

343
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:36,234
Nothing.

344
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,654
What are you holding?

345
00:26:41,654 --> 00:26:45,094
I'm holding nothing. There's nothing.

346
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:49,374
All right, go to bed early.

347
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:26,454
My face masks!

348
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:42,534
What on Earth is this?

349
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:46,634
What's that under your foot? And what are you hiding in your hand?

350
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:50,994
Hurry up. Take it out!

351
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,774
My 999 lipstick (most iconic).

352
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:04,714
Xin Ran, don't get upset. Isn't it just a lipstick?

353
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,394
I will buy lots of them for you.

354
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,814
I'll get you another 999 of them, okay?

355
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,440
This is a limited edition. You can't buy it even with money.

356
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,394
Who needs you to buy 999 of them? Get out of here!

357
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,580
Get out!

358
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,304
Go away!

359
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,894
Xin Ran, Xin Ran, open the door.

360
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:25,280
I really didn't do it on purpose. It really wasn't!

361
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,368
Let me explain!

362
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:28,194
<i>Go far away!</i>

363
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:30,974
Xin Ran, Xin Ran.

364
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:32,704
Nuan Nuan, wait a moment.

365
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:35,094
Can you stop following me?

366
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:39,374
- Nuan Nuan, let me explain.
- I don't want to listen.

367
00:28:41,014 --> 00:28:42,576
Nuan Nuan.

368
00:28:56,864 --> 00:28:57,914
- Nuan Nuan!
- Xin Ran!

369
00:28:57,914 --> 00:28:59,674
- Xin Ran!
- Nuan Nuan!

370
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:01,454
- Xin Ran!
- Nuan Nuan!

371
00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:05,256
Open the door. I really didn't do it on purpose. Let me explain.

372
00:29:06,154 --> 00:29:08,614
I don't want to hear your explanation.

373
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,914
Get lost. Don't come back.

374
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:26,774
Nuan Nuan, give me a chance. I can explain clearly.

375
00:29:28,094 --> 00:29:30,768
I can explain about Luo Yi. I–

376
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:34,274
I don't want to listen. Go away. Don't bother me.

377
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,714
- Xin Ran!
- Nuan Nuan!

378
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:52,254
- Nuan Nuan.
- Xin Ran.

379
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,974
<i>Go away!</i>

380
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:21,494
What happened?

381
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:24,154
Was there a thief?

382
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:27,234
How could a thief cook breakfast for us?

383
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:29,534
This is clearly…

384
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,528
Tastes good, right?

385
00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:37,934
My queens.

386
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,334
I'm willing to serve you.

387
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,028
Nuan Nuan.

388
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:52,028
Wait a moment, Nuan Nuan.

389
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:53,614
Nuan Nuan.

390
00:30:54,314 --> 00:30:56,874
Gu Yi Chen, are you crazy or am I?

391
00:30:56,874 --> 00:30:58,914
Zhao Ming Yang is so unreliable.

392
00:30:58,914 --> 00:31:00,834
You actually followed him and made a fuss.

393
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:03,912
You want to stay at my house and live with Ming Yang?

394
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:06,534
Gu Yi Chen, are you all right?

395
00:31:07,154 --> 00:31:09,074
Yes.

396
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:11,154
I want to stay by your side.

397
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:13,734
I want to be with you.

398
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:15,794
I am sorry for what happened before.

399
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:17,440
I was wrong to hurt you.

400
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,374
Thus, I want to return to your side.

401
00:31:20,874 --> 00:31:22,554
I want to be with you.

402
00:31:23,894 --> 00:31:27,134
- We've already broken up.
- Then let's start over.

403
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:29,654
Gu Yi Chen, you're crazy.

404
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,574
You can think I'm crazy.

405
00:31:32,714 --> 00:31:34,254
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

406
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,974
I want to be with you.

407
00:31:36,974 --> 00:31:40,934
No matter how you push me away, I want to be with you.

408
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:44,594
No matter what, I want to be by your side.

409
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:49,714
It's impossible.

410
00:31:50,514 --> 00:31:51,954
Impossible.

411
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:54,694
We can't return to the past.

412
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:04,012
Nuan Nuan.
