Stay away.

41
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:35,180
- Calm down first. I can explain, President Gu—
- I told you to stay away.

42
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,576
- But—
- Shut up.

43

Why were you under my desk? How long were you here?

What are you up to? What are you trying to do?

00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,980
President Gu, please calm down first and listen to my explanation.

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,160
I really didn't mean to hide under the desk.

I-I was asked to do a favor. I really–

Don't move.

No matter what you just did, or what you plan to do,

54
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,080
you actually even...

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,460
Qiao Nan! Sheng Qiao Nan!

56
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,120

What happened? What's going on?

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,400
Find someone to seal off my office at once.

59
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,160
Don't let her leave without my permission.

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,760
Also, take me to the hospital…

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,040
Yi Chen? Yi Chen! Yi Chen!

62
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,440
Yi Chen! Yi Chen, wake up! We're almost there.

63
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,680
Doctor Chen, you're finally here.

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,720
Check Yi Chen now. His condition is very serious today.

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,248
- He fainted and lost consciousness.
- Okay, I understand.

66
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,188
Yi Chen?

67
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:56,220
Prepare the adrenaline first. Bring the respirator. Hurry!

68
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,272
Yi Chen, Yi Chen.

69
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,920
Yi Chen! Yi Chen!

70
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,540
Why did you stop, Doctor Chen? Keep saving him!

71
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:42,080
Nuan Nuan! Zhao Nuan Nuan!

72
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,040
Sister Xin Ran, help!

73
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,920
Okay, stop here.

74
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,820
Remove the equipment first.

75
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,580
Doctor Chen, keep saving him. You can't just watch him die!

76
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,880
Okay, the rescue fee is ¥600, not a yuan less.

77
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,748
Wait, Doctor—

78
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,192
- Doctor Chen. But I clearly—
- Clearly what?

79
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:15,680
Your heartbeat is more normal than mine. The respirator also works well.

80
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,660
Your skin shows no stress response. It's not an allergic reaction.

81
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,460
You are absolutely fine.

82
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:28,660
Enough. Stop checking.

83
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,100
Your allergy to females' touch hasn't happened today at all.

84
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,504
Yi Chen, it's been more than ten years

85
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:50,940
since this haphephobia (fear of touch) was discovered, right?

86
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,096
Because of this,

87
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:58,060
you and your father have been at odds for over ten years, right?

88
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:09,384
<i>Dad, you told me to come back. What's the matter?</i>

89
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,930
<i>The group will hold a meeting for all investors tomorrow.</i>

90
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,436
<i>Don't be late.</i>

91
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,850
<i>I have my mobile game beta test tomorrow. Maybe I can't get away.</i>

92
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,570
<i>What mobile game? What project?</i>

93
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,290
<i>You dare to call it a project with your tofu-stall company!</i>

94
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,550
<i>My Z Mobile was rated top newcomer in the industry association this year.</i>

95
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,750
<i>My project has estimated daily traffic of over 100 million.</i>

96
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,690
<i>It's not a "tofu food stand" you described.</i>

97
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,870
<i>Industry rating? "Daily traffic"?</i>

98
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,228
<i>One Gu Group investment project can devour ten of your companies!</i>

99
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:45,176
<i>And you talk to me about traffic?</i>

100
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:46,904
<i>You're my son.</i>

101
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:50,498
<i>All of the group will be handed over to you in the future.</i>

102
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:54,538
<i>Either you sell your tofu company</i>

103
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:59,518
<i>or obediently move back home. Get married right away and have children.</i>

104
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:01,216
<i>Dad.</i>

105
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:05,384
<i>Why do you two always fight?</i>

106
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:10,178
<i>Zheng Lin, can't you talk nicely to your son?</i>

107
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,960
<i>Why is she here?</i>

108
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:15,860
<i>How can you talk like that?</i>

109
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,658
<i>Is this how I taught you when I raised you? This is the Gu's home.</i>

110
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:23,938
<i>Why can't she be here? She's your mother.</i>

111
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,798
<i>My mom died fifteen years ago.</i>

112
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,252
<i>You!</i>

113
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,778
<i>I dare you to say that again.</i>

114
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:35,004
<i>Whether it's 10 or 100 times, I'll still say the same thing.</i>

115
00:08:35,004 --> 00:08:36,928
<i>No matter how many times you marry,</i>

116
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,018
<i>I have only one mother.</i>

117
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:41,628
<i>You!</i>

118
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:52,418
<i>Zheng Lin, how could you splash hot water on your son?</i>

119
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:56,858
<i>Yi Chen, are you scalded? Should we go to the hospital now?</i>

120
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:07,118
<i>Yi Chen, are you scalded? Should we go to the hospital now?</i>

121
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,152
<i>Stay away from me!</i>

122
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:16,998
<i>I said it a hundred times.</i>

123
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:18,648
<i>Don't touch me.</i>

124
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:22,060
<i>I don't need your care or your concern,</i>

125
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,800
<i>and I certainly don't need any arranged marriages.</i>

126
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:27,492
<i>Yi Chen.</i>

127
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:31,218
<i>I told you not to touch me.</i>

128
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:34,208
<i>I'll have trouble breathing and an allergic reaction.</i>

129
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,378
<i>- Rotten Brat, you—
- Yi Chen, leave now.</i>

130
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:40,798
<i>All right, don't be angry. Don't be angry.</i>

131
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:43,078
<i>Yi Chen got a burn.</i>

132
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:48,508
<i>Yi Chen?</i>

133
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,298
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

134
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:53,658
<i>Help me...</i>

135
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:55,578
<i>Gu Yi Chen, are you okay?</i>

136
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:57,618
<i>Yi Chen! Yi Chen!</i>

137
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:01,258
Your illness got worse recently.

138
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,078
Although it's a false alarm today, regardless,

139
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:10,778
your unique haphephobia of the opposite sex is a psychogenic illness.

140
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:17,336
The drugs and injections here can't fundamentally cure you.

141
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:19,200
Your illness

142
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:22,138
originates from your heart.

143
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:32,758
Hence, I still advise seeing a psychologist for systematic treatments.

144
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,658
This is the contact information of my senior brother who's overseas.

145
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:43,158
He has done very thorough research of psychogenic illnesses.

146
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:46,118
If you're willing,

147
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:53,078
Yi Chen, I hope you can live normally like everyone else.

<i>[Dr. S]</i>

149
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:00,578
What?

150
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:03,712
Only men can enter his office?

151
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:06,886
- <i>What kind of weird rule is that?
- I didn't know, either.</i>

152
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:10,036
<i>But Director Jiang said that since the company was founded,</i>

153
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,446
<i>this special rule has always been there.</i>

154
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,546
<i>That's too strange.</i>

155
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:18,486
Could it be that he

156
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,906
values men more than women?

157
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:27,466
<i>Not at all.</i>

158
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:32,026
Female employees like me in the company enjoy quite good salaries and benefits.

159
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:36,706
But how did such a guy, who seems to have so many quirks,

160
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:39,940
create such a great company like Z Mobile Games?

161
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,184
- Based on luck.
- What?

162
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:43,766
Just joking.

163
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:45,106
<i>But everyone says</i>

164
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:47,266
President Gu is exceptionally lucky.

165
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,146
He always leads our projects to the top in the industry.

166
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:53,646
<i>But if you interact with him more, you'll see he's very serious in work.</i>

167
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,306
<i>He's strict, resolute and a man of his word.</i>

168
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,466
Only someone who takes work that seriously

169
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:03,286
<i>can lead our company to the top.</i>

170
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:07,872
What he said that day was also correct.

171
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:12,246
Without capability, don't even mention luck.

172
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:15,226
Our president said that?

173
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:17,016
<i>It's nothing.</i>

174
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,626
<i>So what should we do now?</i>

175
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:21,386
<i>With that guy's strange temper</i>

176
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:24,366
and the weird rule only men are allowed in his office...

177
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:26,468
Besides, I…

178
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,866
Sister Xin Ran, where is the nearest police station?

179
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:38,024
Why do you ask this?

180
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:43,086
Can I run away before he comes back?

181
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:53,186
Nuan Nuan, this is the twenty-fifth floor.

182
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:12,446
There is no other room in the president's office. He doesn't rest in the work studio.

183
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:19,466
Is he even human? He is too hardworking!

184
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:27,226
- Sister Xin Ran, help!
- Nuan Nuan.

185
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:54,808
Yi Chen, that girl actually…

186
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,284
Let's go up.

187
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:00,866
I haven't finished talking yet.

188
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,240
<i>[President Gu Yi Chen]</i>

189
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,906
Like I said,

190
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:11,026
not inviting me to be Z Mobile Games' concept artist is your biggest loss.

191
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:37,056
You two, come here.

192
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:54,826
President Gu, this is all my fault.

193
00:15:54,826 --> 00:15:58,626
I accidentally lost the contact information of the exclusive cleaner.

194
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:03,126
As I was under time pressure, I asked my friend to fill in temporarily.

195
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:04,832
It's all my fault.

196
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:05,984
Just punish me if you want.

197
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:08,136
I will bear the responsibility.

198
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:11,372
Wu Xin Ran.

199
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,760
Yes.

200
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:16,786
You joined our logistics department two years ago.

201
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:18,964
Y-Yes, President Gu.

202
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:21,906
You've been diligent in the company since then,

203
00:16:21,906 --> 00:16:24,126
and your performance has also been good.

204
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:28,326
You also get along well with our colleagues and do well in year-end reviews.

205
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:31,026
But you know the company rules.

206
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:35,686
After losing the document, you didn't report to your supervisor and ask for opinions.

207
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:37,986
You found someone to impersonate instead.

208
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:41,726
Do you know what this means?

209
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:45,246
I know. It's my fault, President Gu.

210
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:49,326
I know I've lost my right to remain at Z Mobile Games.

211
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:52,416
Tomorrow morning, I will…

212
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,040
Wait a moment!

213
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:57,786
It's not Sister Xin Ran's fault. I-It's mine.

214
00:16:57,786 --> 00:17:02,526
I wanted to work at Z Mobile Games so I begged her to force me in.

215
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:06,526
President Gu, you know I've always wanted to join your company,

216
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,624
but I failed the interview.

217
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:14,626
There was also a dispute between us.

218
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:18,306
But being a concept artist has always been my dream.

219
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:22,686
Hence, I begged Sister Xin Ran, who has been working here two years,

220
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:24,676
to force my way in.

221
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:28,820
All this was my idea. It's my fault.

222
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,486
If you want to punish anyone, that person should be me.

223
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,104
Nuan Nuan.

224
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:38,640
I know I had many misunderstandings with you,

225
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,616
but I really like Z Mobile Games.

226
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:44,086
And I'm really unlucky.

227
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:48,586
I keep repeatedly messing up this matter.

228
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,828
But

229
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,586
Sister Xin Ran and I are just ordinary girls working hard in this city.

230
00:17:57,586 --> 00:18:01,446
No matter what setbacks we had or mistakes we made,

231
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,406
we are passionate about work.

232
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:07,826
Even if you don't recognize my dream, please don't punish Sister Xin Ran.

233
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:13,106
She has worked hard here for two years,

234
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:14,886
and she also loves the company.

235
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,908
I'm willing to bear this mistake by myself.

236
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:19,946
I sincerely apologize to you.

237
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:24,286
Please forgive me and keep Sister Xin Ran.

238
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,500
<i>[South Tower]</i>

239
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:46,444
Nuan Nuan,

240
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:48,216
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,384
What do you mean?

242
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:55,066
There's no need for apologies between us.

243
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,668
It was I who forced you.

244
00:18:57,668 --> 00:19:02,166
You suffered the consequences and got scolded due to me.

245
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,046
I didn't get scolded.

246
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:07,986
Anyway, isn't Gu Yi Chen always

247
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:11,336
that aloof and indifferent?

248
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:17,548
Besides, you were transferred from the office to the front desk.

249
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:20,594
Give me another minute.

250
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:23,514
I'm sure I can persuade him not to transfer you.

251
00:19:24,014 --> 00:19:28,134
He's already very merciful not to fire me.

252
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,076
You're right.

253
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:37,054
Don't be like this.

254
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:40,834
If I make a mistake in the future, you can forgive me once, okay?

255
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,274
Absolutely and definitely.

256
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:47,234
All right, go back to work.

257
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:50,994
Didn't you say you need to work overtime after the handover?

258
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:54,734
Don't pull all-nighters every day. Your complexion is not good.

259
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,274
The company is hiring now.

260
00:19:57,274 --> 00:19:59,634
My work is not finished,

261
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:01,234
and now I'm suddenly being transferred.

262
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,394
I can't go home for a few days.

263
00:20:04,394 --> 00:20:08,554
But don't worry. Once I finish my handover, I'll go home.

264
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:12,454
No need to hurry.

265
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,336
Just focus on your work and remember to eat on time.

266
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:18,234
See you later.

267
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:33,228
<i>Zhao Nuan Nuan, you still insist on protecting your friend.</i>

268
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:39,054
<i>Now both your life and your work are all over.</i>

269
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:57,634
- What a wonderful day, Zhao Nuan Nuan.
- Wh-What do you mean?

270
00:20:57,634 --> 00:21:02,914
How does it feel hiding under the boss' desk at Z Mobile Games?

271
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:06,714
Zhao Ming Yang, you forget that you stood by and did nothing.

272
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,994
Yet now you mock me?

273
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:13,234
I'll tell you what, Xin Ran will be back tomorrow morning. You'd better move out quickly.

274
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:14,514
I will move out.

275
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:17,054
But before I move out, I have to say

276
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,294
that offending the Z Mobile Games' president

277
00:21:21,294 --> 00:21:23,914
means you're doomed, Zhao Nuan Nuan.

278
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:28,054
Get out! Don't ever return forever!

279
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:38,674
This time, my life is truly over.

280
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:49,764
Yi Chen, I must tell you about what happened.

281
00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:53,594
On the day of the interview, when our car passed a puddle,

282
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:58,314
the driver didn't brake so the car splashed Zhao Nuan Nuan.

283
00:21:58,314 --> 00:22:00,174
She fell by the side of the road,

284
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:03,594
and her drawings were hit by the car.

285
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:07,274
It was our car that damaged them.

286
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:08,672
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

287
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:11,412
You were so fierce with her that day. I didn't dare speak.

288
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:14,974
In the company, you're my boss. I have to keep my job, too.

289
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:19,234
But I can see that she didn't keep resenting it today,

290
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:22,114
and she even took the blame for her friend.

291
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:26,604
So I think she isn't the kind of girl who lacks quality.

292
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:31,354
Maybe just as she said, she's naturally unlucky.

293
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:35,034
Being unlucky and doing wrong are unrelated.

294
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:37,284
Yi Chen, don't be too harsh.

295
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:39,648
I think she really likes our company.

296
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:42,394
Why don't you give her another chance?

297
00:22:46,134 --> 00:22:48,354
Then think it over carefully!

00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:34,194
<i>often fail to achieve good cure rates.</i>

318
00:24:34,194 --> 00:24:37,234
<i>However, when you stated your case just now,</i>

319
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:40,974
<i>you said you've met a girl who doesn't trigger your allergy.</i>

320
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:44,734
<i>Yes.</i>

321
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:48,754
<i>If you really met someone who doesn't trigger your allergy, don't miss out on her.</i>

322
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:52,624
<i>A person like her may be the key to cure your psychogenic (mind) disease.</i>

323
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:56,934
<i>By being with her a long time, you may find how to be normal.</i>

324
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:58,354
<i>Can you find her again?</i>

325
00:24:58,354 --> 00:25:00,974
<i>If you find her, you must keep her.</i>

00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:40,994
Hello, we have opening discounts.

331
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:15,148
Zhao Nuan Nuan, I'm opening a dessert shop.

332
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:17,560
What are you doing here?

333
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,834
Sorry, Boss. I was too excited to draw and forgot.

334
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:24,694
I'll change it right away.

335
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,614
Zhao Nuan Nuan!

336
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,734
I'll clean it up, Boss. I'll clean it up.

337
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:39,674
You have ten minutes to clean this up.

338
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:42,632
Or else you won't get paid today!

339
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:48,548
This girl's bad luck is too incredible.

340
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:51,114
It seems she told the truth at the interview.

341
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:53,348
She's just an extremely, extremely,

342
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:56,894
extremely unlucky girl.

343
00:27:08,314 --> 00:27:12,134
No way. Not again.

344
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:20,354
Yi Chen, why don't we…

<i>His luck is too—</i>

359
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:53,560
- Zhao Nuan Nuan.
- Yes?

360
00:28:54,554 --> 00:28:56,934
Wait, we are not at Z Mobile Games now.

361
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:59,264
What's the matter? What do you want?

362
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,514
You took my pen yesterday.

363
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:04,354
What are you saying? Who took your pen?

364
00:29:04,354 --> 00:29:08,314
Don't talk nonsense. How can you slander an innocent person?

365
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:15,334
I can explain this. I didn't mean to take it yesterday.

366
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:17,134
I was just drawing.

367
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:21,034
And now, somehow it accidentally broke.

368
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:23,374
But it's okay. How much is it? I'll pay.

369
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:25,828
- It's priceless.
- What?

370
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:27,794
It's a handmade pen by a master.

371
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:31,874
The nib is made of gold. It's limited worldwide.

372
00:29:31,874 --> 00:29:34,674
What kind of pen is made of gold?

373
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:38,194
And limited worldwide? Isn't a regular pen good enough?

374
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:41,494
Isn't a mass-production pen adequate?

375
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:43,728
What are you muttering?

376
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:45,514
Nothing.

377
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:53,434
President Gu, can we discuss this?

378
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:56,454
How?

379
00:29:56,454 --> 00:30:00,064
I… I…

380
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,780
If you really want to compensate me,

381
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,128
then work for me at Z Mobile Games for 100 days.

382
00:30:04,128 --> 00:30:05,874
Such a limited-edition pen.

383
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:07,636
If I join Z Mobile Games…

384
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:09,194
Do I join Z Mobile Games?

385
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:12,514
Did you say I could work at Z Mobile Games?

386
00:30:12,514 --> 00:30:17,434
But you rejected me at the interview and said never in this life that—

387
00:30:17,434 --> 00:30:20,254
Don't overthink. It's just your compensation.

388
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:25,156
Report at 3 p.m. If you're late, the work will double.

389
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,774
<i>What's going on?</i>

390
00:30:30,774 --> 00:30:33,354
<i>He wants me to work at Z Mobile Games now.</i>

391
00:30:33,354 --> 00:30:36,994
<i>I-I thought he didn't want me.</i>

392
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:39,874
<i>And how do I owe him again?</i>

393
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:41,534
<i>I wish I owed nothing!</i>

394
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:44,914
<i>Oh my gosh, what can I do?</i>

395
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:49,274
<i>Sister Xin Ran, help me.</i>

396
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:05,234
Zhao Nuan Nuan is so messy.

397
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:09,034
I didn't expect her roommate to be even messier.

398
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,914
Mom always wants to arrange blind dates for her.

399
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:16,156
With them like this, it's rare if they find husbands.

400
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:27,054
Zhao Nuan Nuan, how could you?
