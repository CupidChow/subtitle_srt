<i>[Episode 2]</i>

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,600
- Hello?
- Hello, Zhao Ming Yang.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,100
I don't have time to pick you up now. Come to the Plaza Hotel on your own.

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,900
- What are you going to do?
- What will I do?

30
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,700
I'm going to take revenge!

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,000
Boss, did negotiation fail?

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,700
They are not here for cooperation,

33
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,200
but to control copyright and carve up the Chinese market.

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
I've already rejected them.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,700
If nothing else, they will join forces with Hechuan Technology to jointly block us.

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,400
Then... we need to make arrangements immediately.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,700
Qiao Nan, contact all operations directors, planning,

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
and the art concept studio now.

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,000
We'll meet in the conference room this afternoon.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,300
Also, we need to further push "Legend of the Mighty II"

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,000
and prepare more projects.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Okay, I'll arrange those right away.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The world is small indeed. We meet again, President Gu.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,600
What do you want?

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,200
<i>After our deep dialogue about life,</i>

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,600
<i>I fully experienced President Gu's intelligence and wisdom.</i>

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,200
I also profoundly reflected on my being late, lying, and being unlucky.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,800
- However, President Gu, don't you need some self-reflection?
- Me?

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
The interview notice clearly said 10 a.m.

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,200
President Gu, why did you start early just when you arrived?

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,500
Company procedure is written in black and white.

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,600
Why did you change it arbitrarily due to your personal desire?
<i>[Lobby, Lounge]</i>

<i>Qiao Nan! Qiao Nan! Qiao Nan!</i>

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Are you okay?

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,200
Also, you casually accused others of being late and irresponsible,

56
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
but did you take your own responsibility?

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
Your car splashed filthy water on me. President Gu, did you apologize?

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,700
Just as cops ignore things now, don't assume an apology is not needed.

59
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,900
Lastly, what do you mean by "only talking of dreams"?

60
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,400
I've been drawing almost 20 years. I've held a brush since a toddler.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
I won't reply to your other comments.

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,500
Today, I'll show you what professionalism means.

63
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,040
<i>[Lobby, Lounge]</i>

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Boss!

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yi Chen, it's just a sticky note.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Her hand probably didn't touch you.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,400
- Let me help you–
- Don't touch me!

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,900
That's hilarious. Did you see the look on that guy's face?

69
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,500
My drawing almost served as a seal.

70
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,200
Next time, if he dares to lecture me again,

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,200
I'll draw another one and slap it on him.

72
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,700
I haven't seen you in three years. I can't bear to look at you now.

73
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,400
Zhao Nuan Nuan, are you normal?

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,100
What do you mean?

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,200
You don't even know who he is or what he has done.

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm enforcing justice for Heaven

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,400
and eliminating harm to people, okay?

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,900
Besides, I am your big sister. How can you talk like that?

79
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,400
You were born only a minute earlier than me,

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,500
and you claimed that big sister role for 20 years.

81
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,400
- It hurt!
- I dare you to say it again.

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I didn't say anything.

83
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,300
What's going on with you?

84
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,500
Last week, Mom said you had a job in Shanghai.

85
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,400
Why did you suddenly come here?

86
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,800
You didn't do anything bad, did you?

87
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
What kind of bad things would I do?

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,400
Even if someone did bad things, I'd be the victim, right?

89
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
- Zhao Ming Yang!
- Th-That hurts!

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,100
You'd better confess honestly now!

91
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
I'll tell... tell you now.

92
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,200
I lost my job in Shanghai. Now, I'm living hand-to-mouth (scarcely).

93
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,600
After buying the train ticket, I don't even have a yuan on me.

94
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,100
I didn't dare tell Mom and Dad

95
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,100
so I had to come to you, my dearest kin.

96
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,000
Zhao Nuan Nuan, please take me in.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Enough of that.

98
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,600
I know you made much money in the last two years with voice-over work online.

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm telling the truth. Otherwise, you can search me.

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,900
If I have any money on me, I'll take your surname.

101
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,300
Are you silly? We have the same surname.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
I can feed you,

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,700
but I share a place with a senior sister (close friend).

104
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,900
There's no way I can shelter you.

105
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,400
It won't be too long, just 3-5 days.

106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Once I get the project and find a studio, I'll move out then. I absolutely won't bother you.

107
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,000
- Did you get a job?
- A short-term one.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Once I make money, I'll pay you rent.

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,400
One month?

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,300
Three months?

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,000
Please help me, Big Sis!

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Stop. Don't call me like that.

113
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,000
I got goosebumps.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,900
Give me a minute. I'll check first.

115
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,500
Big Sister Xin Ran seems to work overtime lately.

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,900
If she doesn't return, you can stay for a few days.

117
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,200
<i>[Big Sister Xin Ran, are you coming home tonight?]</i>

118
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,700
<i>[I'm organizing company files today. It may take all night.]</i>

119
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,800
<i>[Be good and don't miss me at home.]</i>

120
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,000
You're lucky. Big Sis Xin Ran works overtime these days

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
so you can stay a few days.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,600
As soon as you find a place, move out quickly.

123
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
I promise!

124
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,300
Yi Chen, isn't it a bit exaggerated?

125
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,400
It's just a sticky note.

126
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,200
<i>"Just"?</i>

127
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,600
To be honest, the drawing is quite good.

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,400
It looks like you.

129
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
<i>Shut up!</i>

130
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,400
<i>Don't come over!</i>

131
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,900
<i>All of you, stay away!</i>

132
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,000
<i>Yi Chen, what are you doing?</i>

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,700
<i>They can't touch me!</i>

134
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,600
<i>I can't let them touch me!</i>

135
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,100
<i>I-I-I will… I will…</i>

136
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,800
<i>Get him out of there quickly!</i>

137
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,500
<i>D-Don't touch me!</i>

138
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
<i>Gu Yi Chen!</i>

139
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,456
<i>Come.</i>

140
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:59,580
<i>Tactile (touch) hypersensitivity?</i>

141
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,960
<i>If the opposite sex touches him, he'll have an allergic reaction,</i>

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,600
<i>and even stop breathing?</i>

143
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
<i>What strange disease is this?</i>

144
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,800
<i>Zhao Ming Yang, behave yourself.</i>

145
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,480
When I'm not at home, don't run around.

146
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,320
If Senior Sister comes home, just hide.

147
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,080
If she finds out that I secretly kept you at home,

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,020
we both will…

149
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,680
Is Senior Sister's last name Ma or Wang?

150
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,740
Her surname is Wu.

151
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,220
I mean, she should be called Wang Chao or Ma Han, right?

152
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,640
The two famous executioners.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,620
All right, all right. I know all of your silly rules.

154
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,000
Besides, my voice-acting work will take all night.

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,680
When you're at home, I'm not.

156
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,840
When you go to work, I'll return to sleep.

157
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,920
Don't worry about me.

159
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,688
What's wrong with me?

160
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:36,080
No job, no income, and no boyfriend.

161
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,040
Zhao Nuan Nuan, you really are a person with nothing.

162
00:10:41,284 --> 00:10:43,208
Shut up!

165
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,656
<i>why should others give you a chance?</i>

166

168

<i>Remember, without real skills, all else is empty talk.</i>

169

171
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,708
<i>who said they could help me find the other lucky half of my life?</i>

172
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,380
<i>Can meeting him lead to anything good? He infuriated me.</i>

173
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,360
I should sleep now!

174
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,292
Zhao Nuan Nuan, turn off your phone!

175
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,780
Keeping early hours is good for health. I won't turn it off.

176
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,404
Who is it?

177
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,530

Why is the landlord here?

00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:26,760
Wasn't the rent due next week?

181
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:34,408
Could it be a sudden inspection?

182
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,280
Or is he going to raise the rent again?

183
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,680
He's not going to kick us out, is he?

Young Lady, I'm sorry to interrupt your beauty sleep.

187
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,060
No problem.

188
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,512
As long as you come, Sir, I'm here through the storms, rain,

189
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,940
morning dew and evening sunset.

190
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,100
Young Lady, you know exactly what to say.

191
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,920
Sir, you came so early.

192
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,740
Do you need something?

193
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,200
Actually, I came to tell you some good news.

194
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,960
In our community, the property management hasn't raised any fees.

195
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,620
- Really?
- Of course!

196
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,540
As long as you live comfortably, I will rent this place to you again next year!

197
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,196
Thank you, Sir!

198
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,260
You don't need to replace your screen.

199
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,320
But it's shattered.

200
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,116
It's the protector that's broken. The inner screen is fine.

201
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,580
Look.

202
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,524
How about replacing the protector? It's the store's anniversary. Protector replacement is 20% off today.

203
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,444
I just came back from abroad. I don't know how to do it.

204
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:36,300
Why don't you draw a circle?

205
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,576
"A circle"? I don't know how to draw a circle, either.

206
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:40,132
- Do you know how?
- I don't know, either.

207
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:42,244
Don't you know, either?

208
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,140
Are you idle or just too idle?

209
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,760
What are you doing during work hours? I'll tell your supervisor!

210
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,440
Miss, are you also sending documents?

211
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,640
Yes, these all need to be sent out.

212
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,920
I have already attached the addresses on the first page. The courier will come this afternoon.

213
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,540
So many files. I'll send them out this afternoon.

214

All right.

215

You just started working here?

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,300
I'm the new receptionist. My name is Fang Mi.

217

Welcome.

218

I'm so happy today.

219
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,120
The rent is reduced, the phone isn't broken, and I got 20% off just now.

Oh, my gosh!

225
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,172
I was an unlucky person, who would trip while walking yesterday.

226
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:44,184
How did I suddenly become super lucky today?

227
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:46,620
Today, how did I become a magical koi (good luck)?

228
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,820
Could it be

229
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,680
from that guy?

230
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,120
So will good things happen when I meet him?

231
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,820
Hello, Nuan Nuan, you're here?

Big Sister Xin Ran,

233
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,260
I have a big secret to tell you.

234
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,700
What secret could you have?

235
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,472
Did your mom set up your blind date again?

236
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:32,900
Did your dad secretly give you money again?

237
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,040
Hey, stop the mocking.

238
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,432
Am I that pathetic?

239
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:39,232
Yes, you are.

240
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,516

<i>Big Sister Xin Ran, I'll tell only you.</i>

244
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,260
You must not tell anyone else.

245
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:57,380
I got a pair of magical glasses that can help people find their other half.

246

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:14,020
By the way, there's a person who has a golden aura,

252
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,120
the sparkling kind!

253
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,120
<i>I think he's just like</i>

<i>His true aura and fortune</i>

00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,920
If I could be around such a person,

258
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,964
perhaps after a while, my own fortune would improve greatly.

Your name is not important.

two days ago for the president's office.

285

Did the janitor report to duty?

286
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,300
Don't tell me you haven't arranged it yet.

Just now, Assistant Sheng from the president's office called me.

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,500
So I need to pretend to be the missing janitor

319
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,900
and clean Gu Yi Chen's office?

320
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,900
I'm not going. I won't clean his office.

321
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,800
I have only less than an hour.

322
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,900
You know how much I need this job.

323
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,800
Do you know how scary it would be if we both lost our jobs?

324
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,600
What about our rent?

325
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,800
And our food expenses?

326
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,800
Nuan Nuan, we were in the same college for four years

327
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,600
and roomed together since graduation.

328
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,300
Please save your Senior Sister!

329
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,400
Nuan Nuan.

330
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,600
Nuan Nuan.

331
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,800
But…

332
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
Let's go!

333
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,820
Big Sister Xin Ran!

I'm just changing my clothes. Why the music?

336
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,700
Life needs a sense of ceremony, after all.

337
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,000
I came here to have lunch with you, not to cover for you.

338
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,800
Big Sister Xin Ran, is this necessary?

339
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
All these are this year's mobile games.

340
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,100
End of the World, Legend, and Battle of the Divine Sea!

341
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,200
They are all Z Mobile Games' most classic works,

342
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,000
and there are so many limited-edition comics

343
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,200
and books on mobile game operations.

344
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Don't tell me he has OCD.

345
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,000
And this office looks very clean.

346
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,200
Why does he need thorough disinfection and cleaning for it?

347

<i>[President Gu Yi Chen]</i>

This guy…

349
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,000
Other than being foul-mouthed,

350
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,100
does he have some psychological issues?

351
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,300
Never mind.

352
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,600
After all, I'm not his psychologist.

353
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
I'm clearly here

354
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,700
to do Big Sister Xin Ran a favor.

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,500
No!

358
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,000
Is it settled?

359
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,200
Well done, Wu Xin Xin.

360
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,300
I thought after today's work end bell,

361
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,900
I would have to go downstairs and mourn my endless youth

362

spent for Z Mobile Games.

Wait.

365
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
The cleaner you sent to the president's office

366
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,800
is a man, right?

367
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,000
Why does it matter if it's a man or woman?

368
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,500
"Why does it matter"?

369
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,900
The matter is huge!

370
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,380
Don't you know the president's office has a rule

371
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,740
that only men are allowed?

372
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,980
Whoever dares to break it will be punished severely.

373
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,100
Put "Legend of the Mighty's" operation plan on my desk this afternoon.

374
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,540
List all companies that want to collaborate.

375
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,020
Postpone the 3 p.m. meeting by half an hour.

376
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,680
- Notify all studio directors not to be late.
- Understood, Boss.

377
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,280
Is the cleaning in my office done?

378
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,980
I notified them before the meeting.

379
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,660
Today, a new exclusive janitor will come.

380
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,160
The cleaning should be done by now.

381
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,220
I told them to absolutely not disrupt your work.

382
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,280
Very good.

383
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,220
Helping others requires payment,

384
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,040
