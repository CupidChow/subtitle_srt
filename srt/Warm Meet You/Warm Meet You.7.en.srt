00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,840
The convenience store ran out of ice. I bought ice water for you.

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,680
Just try it.

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,280
Use it like this so the bruise won't swell up tomorrow.

30
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,660
That hurts!

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,856
So you can feel pain, too?

32
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,120
I'm a normal person.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,940
I thought you were a cold, arrogant,

34
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,480
pain-immune and overbearing boss.

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,820
Where did you learn these adjectives?

36
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,620
From a novel called "My Cute Boss Falls in Love with Me."

37
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,432
Read other novels. How can you be a concept artist like this?

38
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,900
I just helped you, and is this how you talk to me?

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,160
Were you and your father always on such bad terms?

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,140
My mother and father separated when I was nine.

41
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,620
It's been like this ever since.

42
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,020
So the lady just now—

43
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,480
She is my father's second wife.

44
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,640
And your mother?

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,880
She passed away that same year.

46
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,680
<i>Mom! Mom, wake up!</i>

47
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

48
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,860

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,040
<i>Mom. Mom.</i>

<i>Sister Yuan! Sister Yuan!</i>

52
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,280
<i>- Sister Yuan, hold on!
- Mom!</i>

53
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,800
<i>- Sister Yuan!
- Mom!</i>

54
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,960
<i>Wake up, Sister Yuan! Yuan!</i>

55
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,420
Don't look so sympathetically at me.

56
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,096
I don't need family or friends.

57
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:40,276
I have work and Z Mobile Games.

58
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:45,520
You are certainly the best when it comes to insincerity.

59
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,880
This is my favorite milk.

60
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,460
Whenever I'm unlucky, lost, or homesick,

61
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,320
I buy it to drink.

62
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,020
Every time I finish it, it seems all my worries,

63
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,520
sadness, and despair disappear.

64
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,540
Before, you lent me good luck.

65
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,180
Today, I'm sharing good luck with you.

66
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,080
Drink it, and all your worries will be gone.

67
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,940
Are you trying to scare me by appearing abruptly at midnight?

68
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,500
Aren't you happy to see me?

69
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,420
Don't go. I have something to say.

70
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,400
If you're saying those useless words again,

71
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,280
you might as well save your energy.

72
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,940
You said last time if I solve that physics problem,

73
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,060
you will give me a chance.

74
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,340
Does that still count?

75
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:34,640
- Did you solve it?
- Just tell me whether it counts or not.

76
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,980
- Yes, it does.
- Good.

77
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,220
This is the equation result of a senior brother in your department.

78
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,140
Here's the calculation of your department's math professor.

79
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:06,100
This is the final process of your former department head.

80
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,108
And this was personally calculated by my dad.

81
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:14,100
If you think it's still not enough, I can immediately call Silicon Valley

82
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,000
to ask the Ph.D. who designs the best algorithms.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,820
- Fang Mi.
- Here—

84
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:28,760
Senior Qiao Nan, I really, really like you.

Aren't you exiting the car?

87
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
Thank you, President Gu. Good night.

88
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,520
Don't be late tomorrow. Also, remember to clean your dress and shoes.

89
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,100
Understood.

90
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,440
I thought he was being generous.

91
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,296
It turns out he's still that heartless man.

No, no! I need to take that back! How do I take it back?

- Awesome.

Let's go and conquer Z Mobile Games.

Let's go.

Crazy, they are both crazy.

148
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,640
Boss, you've been in a good mood these past two days.

149
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,120
I guess so.

150
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,700
Indeed, that night's damsel-saving-hero event

151
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,712
really boosted you, right?

152
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,824
It must feel really good to have someone back you up.

153
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:46,620
What are you saying?

154
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,020
But honestly, you held her hand that day.

155
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,968
Are you really okay?

156
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,300
I'm fine. Nothing happened.

157
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,780
So what we can confirm is that you're not allergic to her at all.

158
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,856
But why?

159
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:05,020
I don't know. I've told the doctor about my recent experiences.

160
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,240
He is still analyzing and hasn't told me the result.

161
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,480
But he told me to keep interacting with her

162
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,600
and paying attention to her obvious features.

163
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,160
Like what?

164
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,200
Like scent, habits, and small features.

165
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,240
"Small features"?

166
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,200
Her perfume? Height?

167
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,640
It can't possibly be her figure, right?

168
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,380
Well, she has no waist, no legs, no…

169
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,720
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

170
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,468
How could I possibly have such a precious thing like a girlfriend?

171
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:39,540
You're number one in the mobile game industry and my special assistant,

172
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,880
yet you don't have a girlfriend?

173
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,860
All these years, I've been shielding you from wind and rain around the clock.

174
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,860
How could I possibly have time to date another "girlfriend"?

175
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:54,920
You're afraid to.

176
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,040
President Gu, wait for me!

177
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,284
Good morning, President Gu.

178
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,700
You came quite early today.

179
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,920
I'm here early to do the cleaning for you

180
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,380
so you can have a good mood at work.

181
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,780
President Gu, please have some tea.

182
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,240
President Gu, please use the pen.

183
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:44,120
What are you doing here instead of your real job?

184
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,800
- I'm waiting for you to finish so I can say goodbye to you.
- What?

185
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,440
Didn't you promise to transfer me to the concept art studio today?

186
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,780
You haven't forgotten, right?

187
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,180
So it's about this.

188
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,940
Yes, I promised you. I'll take care of it.

189
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,060
Qiao Nan, bring the thing in.

190

<i>[Concept Art Studio's Division in the President's Office]</i>

191
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,100
President Gu, didn't you promise to transfer me to the concept art studio?

then sign and register by the department number.

All delivered?

202
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,320
Mi Mi, what's wrong?

203
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,780
Sister Xin Ran,

204
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm not in love anymore.

205
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,516
That fast?

206
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:37,220
Didn't you just confess to Assistant Sheng?

207
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,140
He rejected me.

208
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,220
And it seems...

209
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,196
he has someone he likes.

210
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,860
Sister Xin Ran, I have a love rival.

211
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,040
Don't cry.

212
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,160
Our voice-acting studio is fine, right?

213
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,360
Yes. Don't worry.

214
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,560
- It's okay.
- Don't cry.

215
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,780
What's wrong, Boss? Aren't you going?

216
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,280
- If I go out in these clothes,
- Stop crying.

217
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,900
I definitely won't make it out of the company's gate.

218
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,960
What do you mean?

219
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,780
Old Jin, do you have any clothes, hats, glasses, or masks?

220
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,872
No.

221
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:27,988
I brought some clothes for my girlfriend's cosplay convention this afternoon.

222
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:38,000
- I will take them.
- Wait, Boss!

223
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:41,412
<i>[Office of the President]</i>

224
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,120
Yao Yao, have you seen President Gu and Assistant Sheng?

225
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,500
They should both be in the meeting room this afternoon.

226
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,700
There's a big investor coming to discuss cooperation.

227
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,280
I see.

228
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,572
<i>[Office of the President]</i>

229
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:04,440
<i>[Legend of the Mighty]</i>

230
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,340
This is the next part of "Legend of the Mighty II" that our company currently produces.

231
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,740
We scheduled its launch for midnight on the weekend two weeks from now.

232
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,260
As is well known, the traffic data from "Legend of the Mighty I"

233
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,680
gave our company very good ratings.

234
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,700
And the pre-order volume for the next part achieved very high value across major platforms.

235
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,140
The figures on the table look good enough.

236
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,500
But for investment, it's not just about these numbers.

237
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,900
So what would you like to see, Mr. Dong?

238
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,960
Mobile game projects have high liquidity and high risk.

239
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,880
Before it's officially launched on the market,

240
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,660
the only things we investors can rely on is experience and technology.

241
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,300
Money doesn't recognize people, much less relatives.

242
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,920
I think you should understand what I'm saying, President Gu.

243
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,360
Of course, I understand.

244
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,140
You must have seen UA and Hechuan Technology, right?

245
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,140
UA and Hechuan Technology…

246
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,880
One has top technology, and the other has its own market and experience.

247
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,000
They make a perfect team when they join hands.

248
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,964
Their cooperation is also the best choice in every investor's mind.

249
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:14,280
- You're right.
- Boss.

250
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,880
Then may I ask why you are sitting in our conference room today?

251
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,120
You're sitting here because, firstly, you have confidence in our technology.

252
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,760
Secondly, you value our control of the project.

253
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,840
And thirdly, besides Legend of the Mighty,

254
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,200
our company has created more than a dozen well-known mobile games,

255
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,600
which are definitely not just luck as rumored.

256
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,640
You're right that money doesn't recognize people, much less relatives.

257
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,060
If you're investing, you'll certainly choose the most promising, top-notch company.

258
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,296
I believe a smart person like you

259
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:49,260
would never choose a newly-established, patched company

260
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,560
over a top-tier company like ours with independence

261
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,020
and control over projects.

262
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,620
As boss of Z Mobile Games, you are as aggressive as you were in the old days.

263
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,760
Let's see what flaws Meilin Investment can pick up this time.

264
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,560
We can prepare the cooperation agreement.

265
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,340
So soon?

266
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,624
<i>Boss, right here.</i>

267
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:29,996
<i>Look, this part can be our copywriting center.</i>

268
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,320
<i>And a sound tuner can be set over there.</i>

269
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,340
Come on. Look here.

270
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,140
We'll make this part into our recording studio.

271
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,520
Boss, how about it? Not bad, right?

272
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,120
Not bad. How did you find this place?

273
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,456
I ran to several cultural parks, but I couldn't find a suitable studio.

274
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:50,940
Then at the cultural park's gate, I met an agent.

275
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,040
He said he had a large flat that could be renovated, and it only cost ¥20,000 ($2,800) a month.

276
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,984
So I came over to take a look. I felt this place was quite suitable.

277
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:02,432
So I signed a contract with him that day and paid three months' rent.

278
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:06,220
It costs ¥20,000 a month, and you paid three months' rent?

279
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,140
Aren't the project funds we reserved basically all spent?

280
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,200
There's still money left for the opening feast.

281
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,720
Why didn't you discuss it with me before spending so much money?

282
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,892
What if something goes wrong?

283
00:23:17,892 --> 00:23:20,700
Don't worry. What could go wrong? The place is right here.

284
00:23:21,288 --> 00:23:24,772
Who are you guys? Why are you in our studio?

285
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:29,000
Your studio? This is the recording studio we just rented.

286
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,176
You must be mistaken.

287
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,500
I am the real owner of this place, with a property certificate.

288
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,060
Wait. How come I don't know I rented my place to you?

289
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,440
That's impossible. When I rented the place, the agent also had a property certificate,

290
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,962
saying the landlord fully authorized him.

291
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,762
He even showed me the keys, the landlord's ID, and everything else.

292
00:23:44,762 --> 00:23:46,942
You must have been deceived by a rogue agent.

293
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:50,422
I worked with them once on consignment,

294
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:52,662
then I took back my property certificate and ID.

295
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:56,642
I didn't expect them to deceive people with fake certificates now.

296
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:58,324
Did you pay them?

297
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:02,622
I paid three months' rent.

298
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:07,642
Bro, I fear your money went down the drain.

299
00:24:10,402 --> 00:24:13,244
All right, enough chitchat. Get out of here now.

300
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,462
Move. Move.

301
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:21,062
- Are you okay?
- I say, I didn't take your money.

302
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:24,482
I didn't rent you the place, and you have no right to stay in my studio.

303
00:24:24,482 --> 00:24:26,762
I warn you, you'd better leave soon.

304
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:29,272
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

305
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:31,342
Your words are unreasonable.

306
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:35,980
Although you didn't rent us the place, the agent must be related to you.

307
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,402
Otherwise, they wouldn't have your property certificate and ID.

308
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:41,762
I'll call them now to come over so we can confront each other.

309
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:44,682
Confront what? You rented from them so go find them.

310
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:46,256
Old Jin, make the call.

311
00:24:46,256 --> 00:24:48,082
Wait. Who let you make the call?

312
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:50,582
Put down the phone. Put it down!

313
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:53,882
Don't move. Put down the phone!

314
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:56,922
- Don't touch me.
- Put it down! Did you hear me?

315
00:24:57,942 --> 00:25:00,162
Look, someone is fighting.

316
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:02,068
Put down the phone, I'm telling you!

317
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,682
You go first. I still have a document to deliver.

318
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:06,662
- <i>Let go of me. Let go!</i>
- Okay.

319
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:11,582
You won't get away with this if you make that call today. Let go of me!

320
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,102
Don't move!

321
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:15,928
I recorded all your actions just now.

322
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:17,920
Now I can use WeChat to call the police.

323
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,702
As long as I press the button,

324
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:23,162
the evidence of you hurting people will be instantly sent to the police.

325
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:26,368
Let go.

326
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:30,622
- And who are you?
- I'm his sister.

327
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,360
<i>[Congratulations!]</i>

328
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,262
<i>[Your submission to Good Luck Cup mobile game selection passed the first round.]</i>

329
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:46,082
- My project actually made it to the second round!
<i>- It has entered the second round.</i>

330
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:51,062
I saw the contest at the industry association and signed up to try.

331
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:54,470
I didn't expect to make it to the second round!

332
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:59,140
My bad luck is really going to change.

333
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:03,342
President Gu.

334
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:09,382
You said you had nothing to do with the rogue agent.

335
00:26:09,382 --> 00:26:14,236
Then I wonder how your property certificate and ID ended up in their hands.

336
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:16,482
I just did a rental consignment once.

337
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:18,042
"Rental consignment"?

338
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:21,722
So you needed to give both your property certificate and ID to the agent?

339
00:26:21,722 --> 00:26:23,924
Weren't you afraid the agent would sell your place?

340
00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:27,822
After all, with your ID, they could change the ownership of your place.

341
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:29,782
I-I didn't think that far.

342
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:31,540
You didn't think that much?

343
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,884
Even if you gave the agent the consignment,

344
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:37,322
after the consignment ended, how many times has your place been rented?

345
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:39,732
Just once.

346
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,432
Twice maybe.

347
00:26:42,082 --> 00:26:44,664
You rented this place out twice after the consignment ceased?

348
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:47,042
- Do you dare say you didn't take the money?
- I didn't.

349
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:49,202
Then why didn't you call the police or change the lock?

350
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:50,882
Why did you let them keep renting this place out?

351
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,762
I just didn't want the hassle.

352
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:54,522
You didn't want hassle?

353
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:56,962
Isn't it a hassle by extra tenants

354
00:26:56,962 --> 00:27:00,148
and being accused of colluding with the agent?

355
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:03,762
Your fear of hassle is a bit questionable.

356
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:07,322
Or do you also get a share of money the agent cheated?

357
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:09,542
D-Don't talk nonsense!

358
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:11,882
My place can rent for ¥30,000-¥40,000 a month.

359
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:15,002
I wouldn't cheat them for just ¥20,000.

360
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:19,122
How do you know they paid ¥20,000?

361
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:21,622
Well…

362
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:23,548
- Ming Yang.
- Yes.

363
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:26,242
- Call the police!
- Okay.

364
00:27:26,242 --> 00:27:28,982
Don't call the police. Let's talk it over.

365
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,022
Don't call the police. How about I refund the money?

366
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:34,042
Let's not call the police. Okay?

367
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:55,042
We've gotten all the money back. Thanks for your help... Teacher.

368
00:27:56,402 --> 00:27:59,282
Are you stupid or naive? Renting a studio is a big thing.

369
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:02,076
How could you just sign and pay without seeing the landlord in person?

370
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:05,692
Old Jin saw the landlord's ID and property certificate.

371
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:11,016
Who knew the agent and landlord were conmen?

372
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:13,222
Do you still joke around?

373
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:18,082
If your sister knew that you nearly lost so much money not long after starting work,

374
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:19,582
she would be very worried.

375
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:22,122
Don't tell my sister, please.

376
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:25,582
You do care about Nuan Nuan.

377
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:29,662
That's because she has been silly and unlucky since childhood.

378
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:33,402
Although I was born only a minute after her, I am a boy, after all.

379
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:35,096
Since I came to her this time,

380
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:37,876
I wasn't any help. I also caused her a lot of trouble.

381
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:41,862
So before a new unlucky boy accepts Zhao Nuan Nuan, I must look after her.

382
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:44,202
You'll look after her? You can't even care for yourself.

383
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:47,122
That was just an accident.

384
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:50,482
Sister, never tell Zhao Nuan Nuan about this.

385
00:28:50,482 --> 00:28:52,442
From now on, you are my real sister.

386
00:28:52,442 --> 00:28:55,842
I-I will be your loyal servant through wind and rain.

387
00:28:56,882 --> 00:29:00,142
All right. Let's go. I still have a document to deliver.

388
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,244
Father.

389
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,542
It won't happen!

390
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:35,142
I won't agree to Meilin's investment in your company.

391
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:39,122
<i>No matter what means you used or how you bribed Dong,</i>

392
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:42,072
<i>I will not sign the investment consent.</i>

393
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:46,982
Meilin's investment will be given to Hechuan Technology as planned.

394
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:49,162
You can give up on this!

395
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:52,282
Is this your so-called fairness and justice?

396
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:55,202
Is this also your so-called professional investment without interference?

397
00:29:55,202 --> 00:29:58,402
- What did you say?
- I got the investment through my own strength and ability.

398
00:29:58,402 --> 00:29:59,982
Why do you reject me?

399
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:02,556
<i>Why do you deny our company's qualifications?</i>

400
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:04,240
Why?

401
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:07,572
You even have the nerve to ask me why?

402
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:12,052
It's because this company has a psychologically abnormal president like you,

403
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:15,822
who can't possibly lead the company in the right direction!

404
00:30:15,822 --> 00:30:20,000
It's also because you lied in front of your parents.

405
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,202
- There is not a word of truth in you!
- When did I…

406
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:26,908
Did you really think I would believe your illness was all better

407
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,904
since you brought that girl to the anniversary party?

408
00:30:29,904 --> 00:30:34,282
<i>Did you also think I would believe that girl was your girlfriend</i>

409
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:37,822
since you two walked around hand in hand?

410
00:30:37,822 --> 00:30:41,062
<i>You can deceive others, but you can't deceive me!</i>

411
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:42,982
