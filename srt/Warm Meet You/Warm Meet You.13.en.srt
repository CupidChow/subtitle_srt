is the biennial digital expo.

You can drink any other drinks in the fridge, but this is mine.

Why?

42
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,800
Is this milk made of gold,

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,000
or was it air-shipped from some African savanna?

- Because it's expired.
- What?

I bought this during Spring Festival shopping this year.

It's been in the fridge for almost half a year now.

It might be 4-8 months expired.

If you drink it today, you might end up in the hospital.

Oh, when our studio officially opens, come visit.

162
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,892
Okay.

163
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,930
If you don't speak, no one will think you're mute.

164
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:33,436
Don't mind him. He's likely having an early mid-life crisis.

165
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,700
<i>Gu Yi Chen! Are you a devil, Gu Yi Chen?</i>

166
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,940
<i>Gu Yi Chen.</i>

167
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,400
<i>I'm really miserable, and you're really mean.</i>

168
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,696
<i>President Gu.</i>

169
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:56,252
Come in.

170
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,840
President Gu, Assistant Sheng asked me to bring you lunch.

171
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,488
Just put it there.

172
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,320
It's already 1:30 in the afternoon.

173
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,660
Indeed, I'm a bit hungry.

174
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,020
These steaming soup dumplings,

175
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,340
fragrant crab roe shumai (dumpling).

176
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,080
braised pork ribs, stewed beef with potatoes,

177
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,860
<i>scrambled eggs with tomatoes, and stir-fried vegetables...</i>

178
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,524
<i>Braised pork ribs,</i>

179
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,240
<i>stewed beef,</i>

180
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,240
<i>and scrambled eggs with tomatoes?</i>

181
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,220
<i>I'm not hungry, not hungry.</i>

182
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,152
<i>I really…</i>

183
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,980
This tastes amazing.

184
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,000
These braised pork ribs are so good.

185
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
I should have asked Qiao Nan to bring more just now.

186
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,912
<i>Gu Yi Chen, you are a devil.</i>

187
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:36,120
<i>I'm not eating. I don't want to eat at all.</i>

188
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,400
<i>I'm not hungry; I'm not hungry. I really…</i>

189
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,640
<i>I'm so hungry.</i>

190
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,720
Have you had enough?

191
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,340
Do you really want to avoid me that much?

192
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,220
But even if you dress like this daily,

193
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,492
I still want to see you every day.

194
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,760
Just joking.

195
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,112
If you dare to dress like this in the company again,

196
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:16,940
don't come to work tomorrow,

197
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,640
Zhao Nuan Nuan.

198
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,060
Gu Yi Chen, don't hit people on the head. It makes them stupid.

199
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,680
You stood in this outfit for over two hours.

200
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,004
That doesn't seem very smart to me.

201
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,240
Come here.

202
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,480
I can't finish so much food alone.

203
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,040
I-I… No, thanks.

204
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,520
I'll go back and have instant noodles.

205
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,528
President Gu, good night, good day, safe travels, and bye.

206
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,040
Wait a minute.

207
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,160
I won't discuss personal issues with you at the company.

208
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,900
I have something important to tell you. Come here.

209
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,700
<i>[Z.M.G. Tech.com]</i>

210
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,200
Is this for me?

211
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,900
Big Sister Xin Ran.

212
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,000
Didn't you have lunch yet?

213
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,800
I'll order takeout for you right away.

214
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,400
What would you like to eat? I'll cover it.

215
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
Is this for Assistant Sheng?

216
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,500
You ran back home midday just to prepare him a lavish dinner.

217
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,800
Are you sure he will eat it?

218
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,200
Of course.

219
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,300
This is my fully-dedicated

220
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
sweet love meal.

221
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,100
If Senior Nan eats it, he will surely fall deeply in love with me.

222
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,900
Is this really a sweet love meal?

223
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,000
It's clearly a witch's meal.

224
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,200
How about I taste it for Senior Nan first?

225
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,100
Big Sister Xin Ran.

226
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Just joking.

227
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,600
I hope that after Assistant Sheng eats your sweet love meal,

228
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,300
he will change his mind and fall in love with our beautiful, cute Little Mi Mi.

229
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,700
Big Sister Xin Ran, I want a hug.

230
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,100
What is it? Go ahead; I'm listening.

231
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,140
Next week, the convention center will host the biennial digital expo.

232
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,080
All mobile game companies will participate, including Z Mobile Games.

233
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,300
As usual, the company's annual key project promotion

234
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,900
will also be launched at the digital expo.

235
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,700
Today, Qiao Nan submitted four key projects of our company,

236
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,200
and your project was listed among them.

237
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,900
Really?

238
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,300
So you must prepare a 15-20 minutes roadshow sample for your project.

239
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,400
You should give a full description of the project,

240
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,300
and you must include relevant audiovisual materials.

241
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,500
If this roadshow sample is recognized by the outside world,

242
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,900
we will start your mobile game project based on this.

243
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Really? Will you start my project's production?

244
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
Certainly.

245
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,900
But it depends on a good roadshow preview.

246
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,600
I can do it well, President Gu.

247
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,500
If it's a roadshow, press conference, or a speech, I can do it!

248
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,900
As long as my project can be released, I can do anything.

249
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,400
Okay, show us your roadshow preview.

250
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,500
I promise to complete it.

251
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,200
Why did the net income increase but the sum of sales decrease?

252
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Did I do something wrong, or is the data itself wrong?

253
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:46,108
<i>[Sheng Qiao Nan: President's Special Assistant]</i>

254
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,600
What are you doing?

255
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,700
Have you eyes in the back of your head?

256
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,200
How did you know it's me?

257
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,600
I don't need to hear or see to know it's you.

258
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Without hearing or seeing,

259
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
how do you know it's me?

260
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,100
Because of your…

261
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,100
Because of my "what"?

262
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,100
What did you just say?

263
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,100
I said, "I'm very busy. You should go."

264
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't have time to play with you.

265
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,100
I didn't come to play with you today.

266
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,600
Next week, I'll go to the roadshow with Nuan Nuan and others.

267
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,900
I may not see you for awhile.

268
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,800
Can't you let me keep you company?

269
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,500
Just for one night, okay?

270
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,400
No.

271
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000

Qiao Nan,

297
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,500
get Fang Mi and Wu Xin Ran from the front desk to join Zhao Nuan Nuan's roadshow team.

298
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,600
Additionally, find two colleagues with rich roadshow experience

299
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,000
to assist them.

300
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,800
We must ensure the roadshow's success.

301
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:38,480
This is our mobile game's main scene.

302
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
- Nuan Nuan.
- Nuan Nuan.

303
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,800
- I'm joining you.
- Come on.

304
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,400
That should be it.

305
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,000
- Let's hurry over.
- All right.

306
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,300
Look, this is the main scene of our mobile game.

307
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Hello, everyone, I'm back.

308
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,840
- Sister Xin Ran.
- Welcome back.

309
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,180
<i>Welcome, welcome.</i>

310
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,280
You've all worked hard, thank you.

311
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,040
From now on, let's work hard together!

312
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,988
Let's go.

313
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,900
I never thought a 20-minute project requires so much preparation.

314
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,700
<i>But... who could have imagined?</i>

315
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,200
<i>Four months ago, I was still an unlucky loser,</i>

316
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,500
<i>failing every interview I had.</i>

317
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,700
<i>Now I actually start my own project sample</i>

318
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
<i>to stand on a press conference stage.</i>

319
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,800
<i>Life really is like a dream.</i>

322
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,500
<i>Jerk, you terrible guy!</i>

323
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,600
Wait, why am I thinking of him again?

324
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,700
Right now, my mind should focus on work, nothing else.

325
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,400
Is this what you want?

326
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,000
Your matters, do it yourself.

327
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,400
Gu Yi Chen!

328
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,500
Are you even human?

329
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,900
Aren't you a devil?

330
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,400
I knew it.

331
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,300
I thought he had really changed.

332
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,700
Turns out he didn't.

333
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,200
That Gu Yi Chen always bullies me.

334
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,800
Big Sister Xin Ran even said he likes me.

335
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,400
More like a demon ghost.

336
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,500
No, only demons would like him.

337
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,100
No, no.

338
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm not sleepy. I must complete this today.

339
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,700
I must.
