<i>[Episode 19]</i>

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,520
It's so late already. Hasn't Yi Chen returned yet?

28
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,620
<i>The number you called is currently not available.</i>

29
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,220
<i>Please call again later.</i>

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,060
<i>Sorry, the subscriber you called does not answer.</i>

31
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,688
He didn't answer.

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,840
Senior Nan! Senior Nan, wait for me.

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,520
- Senior Nan...
- Have you done enough?

34
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,780
Are you happy for what you did?

35
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,320
Are you glad to put me in that situation?

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,540
I told you many times not to get close to me.

37
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,340
Why do you keep following me?

38
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,060
What are you trying to do to me?

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,600
I want to like you.

40
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,560
I don't need you to like me!

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,320
So much happened today; do you still not get it?

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,480
I won't. I can't. I can never be with you!

43
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,860
From today, stop following me.

44
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,040
Don't talk to me again or stay at Z Mobile Games!

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,120
Go back to where you came from.

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,180
I won't!

47
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,680
What do you want?

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,560
I just want to stay with you. I just want to be there for you.

49
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,760
I'm sorry. I didn't know about your past,

50
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,840
but I know it now.

51
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,700
Hence, I won't leave you.

52
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,100
I will be there for you.

53
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,840
I'm sure I can give you the happiness you seek.

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,520
The happiness I want…

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,260
I want a simple, normal happy family. Can you give it to me?

56
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,260
Can you never go to America, stay with me and live without your parents?

57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,300
You can't.

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,528
I know you're the only daughter of your parents.

59
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:28,720
Their greatest wish is for your beloved to live with them, but I can't!

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,380
Why force it if we can't do this?

61
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,580
Do you know why I had no love relationship

62
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,960
or a girlfriend since returning from America?

63
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,140
It's because I don't want to feel abandoned and hurt anymore!

64
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,520
Senior Nan...

65
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,860
If you know that two people's relationship is doomed to end,

66
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,180
why let it begin?

67
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,760
I don't want another person in this world

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,640
to suffer the same separation and hurt like when I was a child.

69
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,080
I'm the one who knows how it feels!

70
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,640
If our starting point is also the ending point,

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,280
are you okay with that?

72
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Can you do it?

73
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,260
Don't tell me you can.

74
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,260
Or you will hurt

75
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,960
your family,

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,680
those who love you most.

77
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,784
Fang Mi,

78
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,120
since it's impossible for us to have a

79
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,000
happy ending,

80
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,920
let's not hurt each other,

81
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,200
but spare each other.

82
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,760
Let's stop here, us two.

83
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,440
Senior Nan!

84
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,700
Senior Nan.

85
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,020
Assistant Sheng, you're back. Yi Chen…

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,500
What's wrong with him?

87
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,620
Why does he look so weird?

88
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,920
Mi Mi, why are you here alone?

89
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,420
Why are you crying?

90
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
Nuan Nuan.

91
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,740
Don't cry; stop crying.

92
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,140
I just saw Qiao Nan go in. Did you two have a fight?

93
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,580
Nuan Nuan, it's over between us.

94
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:11,752
<i>[I like you.]</i>

95
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:47,212
<i>[I like you.]</i>

96
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,820
So Assistant Sheng was abandoned by his parents while young

97
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,200
and had to live with his grandparents.

98
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,840
His grandparents passed away later.

99
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,200
When they passed away, Assistant Sheng was still studying overseas.

100
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,540
Yi Chen returned with him to help handle the funeral.

101
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
By the time they rushed back,

102
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,920
his grandparents had lain in their ice coffins for a week.

103
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,820
Thus, you can imagine how sad and desperate Sheng Qiao Nan was then.

104
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,240
His only family in the world passed away,

105
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,264
while he couldn't do anything from far away.

106
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:09,400
I didn't expect Assistant Sheng's really tough life.

107
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,480
That's why he won't be with Mi Mi for fear of a breakup later.

108
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,560
He would be upset, but Mi Mi would also be hurt.

109
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,760
No wonder he wasn't in a love relationship for so long; he fears hurt.

110
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,100
Assistant Sheng is truly a nice person.

111
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,140
Unfortunately, he and Mi Mi can't have a happy ending.

112
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,880
You can't say that, too.

113
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,280
I think their relationship depends on Mi Mi's choice.

114
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,460
If Mi Mi persists, things could still turn around.

115
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,920
If Mi Mi gives up,

116
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,680
well, there is no other way.

117
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,540
Assistant Sheng and President Gu are similar.

118
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,780
Outwardly, they appear cool and indifferent.

119
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,960
In fact, they are fragile in relationships and were hurt too.

120
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,880
By the way, Nuan Nuan,

121
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,540
what if President Gu messes up in the future?

122
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,800
You must handle it well and be tolerant.

123
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,100
Aren't we discussing Mi Mi?

124
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,420
Why do you suddenly mention me and President Gu?

125
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,660
But Yi Chen is quite nice.

126
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,480
He treats me well and won't intentionally wrong me.

127
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,140
That's good.

128
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,080
But in relationships, all kinds of unpredictable things occur.

129
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,920
I hope during moments of crisis,

130
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,420
you both can be sincere and tolerate each other.

131
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,844
Let's go.

132
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,340
The meeting would have ended long ago.

133
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,960
Why didn't he call me?

134
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,360
Yi Chen, where are you?

135
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
What do you want to drink? The coffee here is not bad.

136
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,720
No need. I have an appointment. I'll leave soon.

137
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,080
All right.

138
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,440
When did you return?

139
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Why didn't you tell me?

140
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,200
Are you with Hechuan now?

141
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,400
I just heard of your position at the meeting.

142
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,660
You're UA's Vice President of Operations collaborating with Hechuan Technology.

143
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,820
I recall you weren't like this in the past.

144
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,580
What?

145
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,840
You disliked mixing business and personal matters.

146
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,800
Who changed you?

147
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,280
Don't be nervous.

148
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,260
Since you asked, I'll answer you separately.

149
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,180
I joined Hechuan Technology

150
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,620
as VP of Operations on a posting from UA United States.

151
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,360
If I remember correctly,

152
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,820
six months ago, we sent someone to Z Mobile Games to invite you for a talk,

153
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,600
but you rejected us.

154
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,820
<i>As a Chinese mobile game company, what qualifies you to monitor?</i>

155
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,360
<i>To succeed, you must hand over this project over to UA.</i>

156
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,940
<i>Even if it's a lone fight, we make only products that belong to us.</i>

157
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,080
So he was your staff.

158
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,960
Are you surprised? I'm not.

159
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,020
You've always rejected me, whether for a relationship or work.

160
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now that business is over, let's discuss a private matter.

161
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,720
Yi Chen, you know why I came back.

162
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,700
I thought I cleared up such things years ago.

163
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,820
In your heart, it's clear, but not in mine.

164
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,320
- Luo Yi...
- I know you've recovered from your allergy.

165
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,540
So your rejection of me years ago doesn't stand now.

166
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:11,160
- Luo Yi...
- I came back to start over with you,

167
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,760
not just us two, but also Z Mobile Games and UA.

168
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,760
UA's current partner is Hechuan Technology.

169
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,140
So what?

170
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,780
I can tell you directly.

171
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,980
UA's goal has never been Hechuan, but your Z Mobile Games.

172
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,660
Only your company deserves UA's technology.

173
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,500
Only you deserve to stand with me.

174
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,360
Don't you fear I'll tell your partners what you've said?

175
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,520
You won't,

176
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,100
just as I don't care about the girl you're with.

177
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,872
You investigated me.

178
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
I care about you.

179
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,420
I don't want your care.

180
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,920
So stop doing things that make me disdain you.

181
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Yi Chen, I like you.

182
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,120
<i>I returned for you.</i>

183
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,960
<i>So I won't give up.</i>

184
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,680
You're finally here.

185
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,080
Why did you come down dressed like this?

186
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,640
I didn't want you to wait long.

187
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,120
Am I cute?

188
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,200
Yes, but aren't you cold?

189
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,444
Yes.

190
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,620
You had a meeting until now?

191
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,956
Did you miss me?

192
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,100
N-No way. I was busy today.

193
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,740
I had many important team matters to deal with.

194
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,480
I had two meetings.

195
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,420
I also went to Mi Mi's home in the evening.

196
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,068
- When I came back, I...
- I missed you.

197
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,660
I missed you a lot.

198
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,060
What? Why did you suddenly kiss me?

199
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,880
I thought you couldn't touch girls.

200
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,920
Why do you keep touching me now?

201
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,220
You're the only one I want to touch.

202
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,640
Yi Chen,

203
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,480
you seem to act weird today.

204
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,780
No, it's because I didn't see you for a while.

205
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,040
It was only an afternoon.

206
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,940
Was your meeting good this afternoon?

207
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,820
Did you meet anyone?

208
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,400
Right, much media was at the industry association.

209
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,720
Did your allergy relapse?

210
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,860
No, I'm fine, very fine.

211
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,180
That's good. I worried about you.

212
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,380
Nuan Nuan, in the future, we'll never separate.

213
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,080
No matter what happens, let's never part.

214
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,700
Whatever we encounter, we must trust each other

215
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,380
and never break up, okay?

216
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,660
Okay, in the future, no matter what happens,

217
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,920
we must trust, forgive and understand.

218
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,020
We'll never mention breaking up.

219
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,720
We'll never separate.

220
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,820
We'll always be together.

221
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,680
I need to go back.

222
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,620
Ming Yang texted me.

223
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,800
But I can't bear to leave.

224
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,540
I don't want you to go back.

225
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,940
Why don't you move in and live with me?

226
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,560
I want to turn you into a tiny pocket cat

227
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,360
and carry you in my pocket daily.

228
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,880
So anytime, anywhere,

229
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,900
I can see you whenever I want to.

230
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,536
Meow.

231
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,660
Go home now. Don't let Ming Yang worry.

Does he still remember he has parents?

253
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,880
He really thinks he jumped out from a cracked stone.

254
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,020
If you miss your son, just call him.

255
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Want me to call that ungrateful person first? Dream on.

256
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,920
And you, stop thinking of finding him.

257
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,200
Let him fend for himself. Pretend I never had a son.

258
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,852
You two are similar: stubborn and in denial.

259
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:25,980
- What did you say?
- Would l dare to say anything?

260
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,340
I don't care about him anyway.

261
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,240
Stop telling me to call him.

262
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,080
All right, here's your snail mail (postal).

263
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,160
I brought it up for you.

264
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,500
Why did someone send snail mail to our home?

265
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,080
Mi Mi still hasn't come to work?

266
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,400
She applied for seven days' leave.

267
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,080
Okay, let her have a good rest during this period.

What's wrong with you?

271
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,580
Didn't you rest well last night?

272
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,064
I didn't sleep.

273
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,880

Team Leader, the meeting is ready.

276
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,700
Okay, I'm coming.

277
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,580
Bad news, President Gu, Assistant Sheng.

278
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,500
- Something bad happened.
- What is it?

279
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,800
Several company servers were suddenly infected with malware since late last night.

280
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,180
Several online games are affected.

281
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,600
Among them, "Legend of the Mighty" is the worst affected.

282
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,360
Most online players' URL (web address) was tampered with and made an illegal link.

283
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,380
All media platforms are currently reporting this.

284
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,220
The whole industry talks about it.

285
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,060
How could this happen?

286
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:26,905

Qiao Nan,

290
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,920
get leaders of Program Center, Security Center and Operations Center here now. Hurry!

291
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,440
Before 11:30 p.m. last night, all servers operated normally.

292
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,180
Our testers checked all ports.

293
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,360
Many online players had crashes, lag, and inability to play the game.

294
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,120
We instantly activated the highest level of firewall and searched for malware.

295
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,660
We discovered the malware wasn't an external intrusion.

296
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,440
It was directly from our company's internal computer,

297
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,180
bypassing all firewalls and infecting the server port.

298
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,480
Are you saying that last night, someone used our internal computer

299
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,320
to load malware into the server?

300
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,260
Yes, our department does its best to trace the IP address.

301
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,380
- Check all of last night's surveillance footage.
- Okay.

302
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,280
- Director Jiang.
- Yes.

303
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,380
Qiao Nan, go and personally check it.

304
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,920

Why isn't Xiao Yu here yet?

311
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,320
He distinctly reminded everyone about the morning meeting.

312
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,800
Program Center just called everyone to meet. Perhaps Xiao Yu is there, too.

What happened?

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,380
Hechuan just launched a new project this morning. It's online for beta testing.

317
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,240
But this project is too similar to ours.

318
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
From the poster and characters

319
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,800
to the game format, it's a similar version.

323
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,140
Team Leader Zhao, President Gu wants to see you.

324
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,736
- Now?
- Immediately.

325
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,200
President Gu, Assistant Sheng, and department heads.

326
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,600
Team Leader Zhao, when you worked overtime last night,

327
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,560
did you bring your portable hard drive?

328
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,380
Yes, but I have another very important matter.

329
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,956
Give it to me first.

330
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,350
<i>[President Gu Yi Chen]</i>

331
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,080
President Gu, although I don't know what's going on,

332
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,660
I just received a message...

333
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:19,580
Last night, you used the hard drive in the Original Art Studio around 11 p.m., right?

334
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,400
It was around 10 p.m.

335
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,820
I worked overtime at the studio yesterday.

336
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,440
After finishing the plan, I wanted to save it in my computer.

337
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,240
Hence, I went back to Original Art Studio to plug the hard drive into my old computer.

338
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,736
Take a look.

339
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,900
What's wrong? What happened?

340
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,600
There are several key servers in the company

341
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,280
that were infected by malware that bypassed the firewall.

342
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,900
Several major online projects were seriously affected.

343
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,580
Infected by malware and bypassed the firewall?

344
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,000
We now suspect someone used a company computer

345
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,920
to bypass protection security of vulnerable ports

346
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,300
in the intranet hotlinks and loaded the malware.

347
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,360
You—

348
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,060
You aren't suspecting me, right?

349
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,900
No, I wouldn't do such a thing.

350
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,800
Found it. This is the hard drive.

351
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,680
This hard drive has been loaded with an automatic program.

352
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,800
Once connected to the intranet, it will automatically find vulnerable ports.

353
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,620
On the surface, it runs a small vulnerability test,

354
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,440
but it directly hacks several servers.

355
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,040
No! President Gu,

356
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,540
I wouldn't do such a thing.

357
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,280
I have no reason to do this.

358
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,380
"Reason"?

359
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:43,000
The producer of a company's new project will have her own reason to undermine company interests.

360
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,440
Is this reason sufficient?

361
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,460
<i>[Produced by UA and Hechuan]</i>

362
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,820
We wouldn't have believed it yesterday,

363
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,420
but Hechuan Technology launched this new project today.

364
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,920
It's about 90% similar to the project you are working on, right?

365
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,420
What are you trying to say?

366
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,940
Team Leader Zhao, have you contacts with people from Hechuan Technology?

367
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,560
Did you possibly sell your project to our rival?

368
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,920
Are you saying that in order to sell my project,

369
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,740
I hacked the company server and my own online mobile game?

370
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,060
Anything is possible for money.

371
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,740
You're defaming me. Show me proof.

372
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,560
President Gu, I didn't do it. Trust me.

373
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,960
I have no reason or motive to do this.

374
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,260
I came to report Hechuan's new project launch to you.

375
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,180
I guarantee my team and I just learned of it.

376
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,540
About my hard drive, I really don't know how this happened

377
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,120
and I don't know why such an invasive program is on my hard drive.

378
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,448
But...

379
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,560
please trust me.

380
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,988
Assistant Sheng.

381
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,060
Boss, this is bad.

382
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,980
UA and Hechuan Technology filed a lawsuit with the Industry Assocation and Intellectual Property Court

383
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,560
on the grounds that

384
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,900
our company's new project "Meeting You" infringed copyrights of their "Meeting Romance."

385
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,060
You can leave first.

386
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,160
Boss, how could this happen?
