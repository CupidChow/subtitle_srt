00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,576
But I still couldn't beat this overwhelming bad luck.

159
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:10,200
First, I got left by the bus.

160
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,320
Then an old man suddenly appeared while I was biking.

161
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,120
The most outrageous is that when I fell, a super luxurious car—

162
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,176
The car?

163
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:20,584
What about the car?

164
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:21,960
Why does it seem

165
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
it's this car?

166
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,220
It is this car! I recognize it.

167
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,240
What?

168
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,940
This is the one! When passing the puddle near me,

169
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,920
it didn't even brake and just drove straight past.

170
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,460
That's why I ended up a mess

171
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,680
and missed my vital interview!

172
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,740
"This car"?

173
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,540
Are you sure?

174
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,280
I'm sure. It's the one.

175
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,900
Enemies certainly meet on a narrow road.

176
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,420
I didn't expect to run into you here.

177
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,536
All thanks to your owner's lack of civility, I missed the interview.

178
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:06,544
All thanks to your owner's inhumanity,

179
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:10,520
I was kicked out. It's all your fault!

180
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,108
I didn't even start yelling, and you yelled first.

181
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:18,280
All of my bad luck today was due to you.

182
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:51,308

183

♫ <i>Flashes colorful rays of light</i> ♫

184
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,900
Is this your car?

185
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,800
- Who is this?
- I don't know.

186
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
- Who is it?
- Maybe an interview applicant.

187
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,200
Are you the car owner?

188
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,860
I think there's a dispute between me and your car.

189
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,340
If you're the owner, you should apologize to me at once.

190
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,780
Boss. This…

191
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,676
Wait a moment.

192
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:24,740
What do you mean by this? Do you look down on me?

193
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,800
You'd better apologize before I get angry

194
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,500
and call the police.

195
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,400
Nuan Nuan, stop.

196
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,220
- Don't.
- Wait, Sister Xin Ran.

197
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,260
Let me settle it with this selfish, arrogant, rich man first.

198
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,420
Apologize immediately.

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,980
Nuan Nuan, he is our president.

200
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,200
I don't care who he is.

201
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:54,936
What? Y-Y-Your...

202
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,928
Your president?

203
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:08,480
I'll give you another chance to interview.

204
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,360
Do you dare?

205
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,024
Of course…

206
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,744
I dare to.

207
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,040
<i>What kind of interview is this?</i>

208
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,610
<i>Can he hear me from so far away?</i>

209
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,840
<i>[Z.M.G. Tech.com]</i>

210
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,800
- Zhao Nuan Nuan.
- Yes.

211
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,680
You're a Zhejiang University animation graduate.

212
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,760
You have no work experience or internship experience.

213
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,240
You've never worked in any projects.

214
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,260
You have nothing, yet you dare to interview for Z Mobile Games?

215
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:46,580
Although I lack work experience and wasn't on any projects,

216
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,880
I loved mobile games and comics since a child.

217
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,440
I have an account in all mobile games on the market.

218
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,840
I am very familiar with all famous comics.

219
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,360
I don't have work experience since I focused on studying.

220
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,560
I didn't do an internship, but I always drew

221
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,840
my own projects before graduation.

222
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,544
Where is your artwork?

223
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:07,700
- Show me.
- I have it. Of course, I have my artwork.

224
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,780
This artwork I specially prepared for this interview.

225
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,624
It is also the most important scene in my project.

226
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,340
I drew it for four weeks.

227
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,344
It's entirely according to…

228
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,440
No, please don't misunderstand.

229
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,412
I didn't purposely bring a bad piece.

230
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:30,492
I was too unlucky on the way here and had an accident.

231
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:31,960
That's enough.

232
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,192
President Gu,

233
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,260
I didn't intend to bring a bad piece, and I didn't mean to be late.

234
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,740
I really value this job, and I truly like Z Mobile Games.

235
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,520
Please give me another chance. I will—

236
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,044
Enough.

237
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,040
If you really value this job,

238
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,360
you should arrive ahead of the time on the notice.

239
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,832
If you really like this job, you should protect your work as your life.

240
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,772
No matter what occurred on your way here,

241
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:03,240
it's no reason to turn your work into this.

242
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,680
Z Mobile Games needs passionate artists who respect their profession.

243
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,400
And you... do not qualify.

244
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,200
<i>Great. It's all over now.</i>

245
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,380
<i>And I wanted to become the best concept artist.</i>

246
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,120

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,560
I've called you more than a dozen times. You didn't answer my calls.

249
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,220
<i>Didn't you go for an interview today?</i>

250
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,096
How did it go?

251
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,748
Mom…

252
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:46,320
What's wrong?

253
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,900
Why are you crying?

254
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,144
Nuan Nuan, what's the matter? Why are you sad?

255
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:54,340
Did you have a hard time out there?

256
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,960
Or... are you out of money?

257
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,948
No, Mom.

258
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:00,956
I have money.

259
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,716
I'm glad you're not asking for money.

260
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,872

<i>Nuan Nuan,</i>

262
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,400
it's not easy for a girl to be away from home alone.

263
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,640
Your dad and I are always worried.

<i>We just hope you can find a nice boy</i>

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,276
Mom, you're at it again.

267
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:25,520
Sweetie, just listen to me.

268
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,324
Okay, Mom. I...

269
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:29,340
My car is here. My colleague invited me for a meal.

270
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,740
- Nuan Nuan, how do you have a colleague if you're jobless?
- Goodbye. Have a safe trip.

271
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,340
<i>You! Zhao Nuan Nuan!</i>

272
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,200
She never talks of important things except arranging blind dates.

273
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,120
I'm only 22, Mom.

274
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,220
<i>Nuan Nuan, are you out of money?</i>

275
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,440
<i>Tell me if you need money. My secret stash is all for you.</i>

276
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,080
Dad.

277
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,240
I only have a few hundred left for living expenses.

278
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,420
My job interview also failed.

279
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,940
What should I do next?

280
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,220
Do I really have to do part-time jobs?

281
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,964
Deliver takeout?

282
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:38,400
No way. If I have to deliver takeout, I will have no time to draw.

283
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,140
Hello, your special value meal is here.

I'm really unlucky.

286
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,220
- Unlucky job.
- Unlucky collaboration.

287
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,400
Annoying president.

288
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,480
Stubborn president.

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,320
Unfair Z Mobile Games!

290
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,580
Z Mobile Games gives no chance at all.

291
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:16,412
Sir, were you also rejected by Z Mobile Games?

292
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:18,480
Were you kicked out by Z Mobile Games?

293
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,512
I was.

294
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:25,260
I was kicked out by arrogant, annoying President Gu of Z Mobile Games.

295
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,060
He didn't listen to my explanations. He fully disregarded others' feelings.

296
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,000
He is ruthless, conceited, and irksome!

297
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,760
Sir, you should never work with him. You'd better not see him again.

298
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,180
D-Don't cry.

299
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,580

The other lucky half of your life.

307

The other half of my life?

Glasses?

309
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,400
Implement all these by tomorrow.

Also, start working on "Legend of the Mighty II."

Okay, rest assured. I'll handle it.

- Has there been a reply from UA?
- Yes.

313
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,880
We scheduled a meeting with their technical director at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

314
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,440
Okay, I'll go in person.

315
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,460
I think I can handle their technical director.

316

Qiao Nan, thank you.

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,840
I'll be satisfied.

320
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,860
I'll leave first. Finish your work early and go home.

321
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,480
I'm leaving now.

322
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,440
Hello?

323
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,660
The user you dialed is temporarily out of the service area.

324
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,040
Zhao Nuan Nuan, you have one hour to pick me up at the station.

325
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,500
Otherwise, I'll take a taxi using your account, and you'll pay the fare.

326
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,800
- Zhao Ming Yang!
<i>- You don't have to shout at me.</i>

327
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,720
Let me think whether

328
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,480
I should use your account to call a luxury business car

329
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,920
or a high-end exclusive one?

330
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,124
If you dare use my account to call a luxury car, I'll instantly cut off our sibling relationship.

331
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,400
Hello, a high-end service?

332
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,380
Zhao Ming Yang, where are you?

333
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,108
<i>High speed train station.</i>

334
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:27,268
Wait for me there!

335
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:14,800
That scared me! I thought I was seeing things.

336
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,508
Wh-What's going on?

337
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:30,120
What... what odd glasses are these?

338
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,640
What did I see?

339
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,420
Oh my gosh. I almost had a heart attack.

340
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,600
What exactly do I see?

341
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,420
Could it be

342
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:54,700
that grateful man?

343
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,520
<i>The other lucky half of your life.</i>

344
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,480
"These can help you find the other lucky half of your life."

345
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,320
"You can see everyone's aura and color,"

"That one brings you good luck."

349
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,300
Really?

350
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,540
You think I'm still a kindergartner?

351
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,180
It must be a joke.

352
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,860
<i>No way. Is it true?</i>

353

<i>"The most compatible, destined life partner"?</i>

<i>Then I—</i>

355
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,460
So my other half

356
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,744
is also a super unlucky person?

357
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,680
Isn't it enough that the world has such an unlucky person like me?

358

Okay.

365

What?

392
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,424
You are not punctual and lack professionalism. You only talk of dreams.

And now, you are even lying.

Stop blaming your failures on bad luck to get pity and trust.

All the copyrights, research, and in-depth studies of the project

must follow our company's procedures.

If it's a collaboration, it must be jointly monitored.

As a Chinese mobile game company, what qualifies you to monitor?

I think it's pointless to continue this conversation.

I advise you to think it over. Your company's current data is indeed good.
