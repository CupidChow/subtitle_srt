Now that everyone is here, Qiao Nan, please begin.

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,780
Today, we have convened a meeting

196
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,300
with colleagues from the Original Art Studio and Programming Center.

197
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,200
There are mainly two things to announce.

198
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,440
The first is that we've already received ample feedback

199
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,040
from the Digital Expo hosted a few weeks ago.

200
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,540
Our Z Mobile Games achieved very good results at the Digital Expo.

201
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:39,060
So both the company and President Gu are very satisfied with everyone's performance.

202
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,600
With the expo performance, upper management decided directly on the second matter.

203
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,640
The four projects promoted at the expo will all have their production teams started up.

204
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,840
Full production begins.

205
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,660
Really? Does it include mine as well?

206
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,180
What, did I not make myself clear?

207
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,580
I clearly said all projects.

208
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,920
It seems you're not very satisfied.

209
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,540
Qiao Nan, about the "Meeting You" project…

210
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm willing. I'm willing.

211
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm 10,000 times willing.

<i>I hope when that time comes in the future, you will also reply, "I do."</i>

- Over there. Thank you for your hard work.
- Okay.

214
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,164
Slow down.

215
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,500
Be careful; just put it over there.

216
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,040
Slow down. It's pushed in.

He forces Senior Nan to work overtime daily but doesn't give him a raise.

319
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,240
It's our super busy Producer Zhao.

320
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,000
How could I dare to interfere with your work, interrupt your rest time,

321
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,880
or affect your work condition the next day?

322
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,080
So you were angry.

323
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,640
What do you mean?

324
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,120
I thought that a big boss like you

325
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,080
would only give orders every day and never get angry.

326
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,700
Yes, I am that kind of big boss who gets very, very angry.

327
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,420
Yi Chen, do you recall how many times you told me

328
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,320
that you were an unconventional boss?

329
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
What do you mean by unconventional?

330
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,120
You said you were a boss with many relatives,

331
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,900
a boss whose home has power outages,

332
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,840
and a boss who loves to drink milk.

333
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,080
Now you're an innocent boss who gets angry.

334
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,920
You're really cute.

335
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,020
"Cute"?

336
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,200
All right, all right, I was wrong.

337
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,760
I know that this time I neglected you for work.

338
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,880
Will you forgive me?

339
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,660
I promise I won't stand you up again in the future.

340
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,300
I will surely not be late again, okay?

341
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,940
- You still want a next time?
- No, no, there won't be a next time.

342
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,320
Others will see.

343
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,900
Then I'm leaving.

344
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,060
No, don't.

345
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,112
Gu Yi Chen!
