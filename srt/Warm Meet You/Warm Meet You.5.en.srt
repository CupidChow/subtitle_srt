I-I-I'm sorry.

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
I dropped my glasses. I can't see where I'm going.

I...

30
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,316
- Zhao Nuan Nuan,
- I apologize for disturbing you.

G-G-Gu…

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm sorry. I really walked in by accident.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,980
I'll leave immediately.

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,516
Zhao Nuan Nuan,

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,116
let's get married.

42

Don't get the wrong idea. I don't have any fetishes.

43
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:11,200
This is my high school uniform.

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,076
I need a fake girlfriend right now.

45
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:20,500
If you don't have a boyfriend, you should consider it.

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,516
"A fake girlfriend"?

47
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:23,800
That's right.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,940
Someone who can accompany me on any occasion and meet my parents.

49
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,620
Are you joking, President Gu?

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,460
Someone like you can't find a girlfriend

51
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,824
and needs to find someone to pretend?

52
00:03:37,824 --> 00:03:41,980
If you agree, you won't need to compensate me for the broken pen.

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,820
I don't understand.

54
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,880
I'll increase your salary for this month by 100%.

55
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:51,260
- I'm not that kind of person.
- Then 200%.

56
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,420
- Wait a minute.
- By 300%.

57
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,476
I can do it.

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,800
Since you've agreed, let our cooperation begin.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,400
Starting tomorrow, you must be on standby 24 hours a day

60
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,960
and maintain a working state.

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,420
Tomorrow, I'll have Qiao Nan draft a new job contract for you.

62
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,620
The moment you sign it, you will receive this month's salary.

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,340
Must I sign a contract, too?

64
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,172
Happy cooperation.

65
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,280
<i>Why does he need a fake girlfriend?</i>

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,600
<i>He's so handsome, lucky, and rich.</i>

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,560
<i>Countless girls will swarm at him if he just waves.</i>

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,340
<i>But why me?</i>

69
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,948
<i>Hasn't he always disliked and tormented me?</i>

70
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,564
<i>Why?</i>

71
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,576
Never mind.

72
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,192
<i>Cheers!</i>

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,760
- Welcome home!
- Welcome home!

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,400
How come you two are here?

75
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,380
I brought this pretty girl back

76
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,680
to throw a girls' night for you.

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,496
You look so pretty.

78
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,152
Thank you.

79
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:26,200
Everyone says that.

80
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,960
Children can't drink.

81
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,320
I'm already 22.

82
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,060
You're 22 with no face (dignity), bosom, or butt.

83
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,560
People will think you're still in elementary school.

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,060
I get the "no bosom and butt" part. But what's with the "no face"?

85
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,000
Big Sister Xin Ran, I didn't see you awhile since you worked overtime,

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,240
and you forget how powerful I am?

87
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,340
Nuan Nuan! Nuan Nuan, stop!

88
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,060
Nuan Nuan, no! Spare me!

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,720
Isn't that Assistant Sheng?

90
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,740
Yes, he's my Senior Nan.

91
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,616
"Senior Nan"?

92
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:13,320
There's a story here.

93
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,900
Senior Nan and I went to the same school, but different departments.

94
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,920
He started college two years earlier than I

95
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,240
and was a top student in advanced physics and astrophysics.

96
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,720
"Physics"? "Astrophysics"?

97
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,440
When Senior Nan was in school,

98
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
he was a famous straight-A student

99
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
and the most popular male student in Science and Technology Dept.

100
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,980
Every Valentine's Day,

101
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,524
he received more chocolates than all the other boys in both departments combined.

102
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,820
I've always liked him a lot.

103
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,140
But he has always treated me like a little sister who knows nothing.

104
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,520
No matter how many times I confessed to him,

105
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,840
he just told me,

106
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,252
"I'll surely return to China after graduation. I won't stay abroad."

107
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:08,920
So there was no chance for us to be together.

108
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,540
I didn't know Assistant Sheng was so outstanding.

109
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,860
However, I found out later that he met President Gu in college.

110
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,440
After graduation, they returned to China together, founded Z Mobile Games,

111
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,840
and made the company top-notch.

112
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,360
They're really amazing.

113
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,888
I've always missed Senior Nan a lot

114
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:31,120
so I returned to China as soon as I graduated.

115
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,680
I want to bravely pursue the person I like.

116
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,080
I want to be with Senior Nan for the rest of my life.

117
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,460
Mi Mi, you're so amazing.

118
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,880
You're so brave for pursuing and confessing to the guy you like.

119
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,760
It must be great to find your true love.

120
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,740
However,

121
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:59,580
do you two know what he said to me after my last brave confession?

122
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,360
What?

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,888
<i>You like me?</i>

124
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,560
<i>If you want to like me,</i>

125
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,720
<i>solve this astrophysics math problem.</i>

126
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,656
<i>Then we can discuss that.</i>

127
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,250
<i>[Astrophysics Math Problem]</i>

128
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,320
I didn't expect Assistant Sheng to be like this.

129
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,360
He really lacks a sense of romance!

130
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,720
With a pretty girl like you confessing to him,

131
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,800
instead of being touched, he actually gave you a math problem to solve.

132
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,080
Is he a fool?

133
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,900
Assistant Sheng is the definition

134
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,820
of "I'm single on my own merit."

135
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,560
Actually, it's not like that.

136
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,280
Senior Nan is actually very nice.

137
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,460
Big Sister Xin Ran, do you have a boyfriend?

138
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,160
What kind of person is he?

139
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,720
Big Sister Xin Ran is amazing.

140
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,900
I've done some calculations, and her romance history dates back to kindergarten.

141
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,660
Really? What about you, Nuan Nuan?

142
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,000
Do you have someone you like?

143
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,480
Someone I like…

144
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,100
About this, I have something to tell you, Big Sister Xin Ran.

145
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,320
- Our boss is crazy.
- Why?

146
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,580
He actually told me today to pretend to be his girlfriend.

147
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,660
He also said, as long as I agree,

148
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,220
not only will our grudges be cleared,

149
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,720
he'll give me a raise.

150
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,300
Big Sister Xin Ran, you were at Z Mobile Games for years.

151
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,760
Was he always this strange?

152
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,260
Mi Mi, has Assistant Sheng ever told you

153
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,000
that their boss is actually such an eccentric guy?

154
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,120
What should I do, Guys?

155
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,760
<i>What else can you do?</i>

156
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,520
<i>Say yes!</i>

157
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,040
What? Do you want me to say yes?

158
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,360
No.

159
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
We can't let you be so sloppy and casual every day, Nuan Nuan.

160
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,960
Where is my silk dress?

161
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,380
And my four-inch-combat boots?

162
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,476
You can pick any of my secret weapons.

163
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:17,360
You must dress up beautifully.

164
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Why just "pretend to be his girlfriend"? Win him over!

165
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:25,744
Come on.

166
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,300
Stop.

167
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,400
You two, just give me a break.

168
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,020
Marry a rich, handsome man

169
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,060
and become a general manager.

170
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,160
Gu Yi Chen…

171
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,484
Zheng Lin, come and look.

172
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:57,980
Which one of these girls do you like better?

173
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,360
See this one, the Zhou Family's second daughter, who just returned from abroad.

174
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,500
And this one is the Sun Family's youngest daughter, who just turned 22.

175
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,000
I think all of them are pretty.

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,380
Are you so bored that you view other people's children?

177
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm doing this for Yi Chen.

178
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,060
Yi Chen is almost 26, right?

179
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,360
He can't be single forever, right?

180
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,420
Don't you also hope he finds a suitable girl,

181
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,840
gets married, has children, and settles down

182
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,776
so he can take over at the Group?

183
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:30,270
In fact, I think Yi Chen is not a disobedient child.

184
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,180
He is mostly rebellious against you.

185
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,780
Besides, he hasn't met a girl he likes in years.

186
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,620
So I thought maybe you should call Yi Chen to the Group's anniversary in three days.

187
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,820
And I will invite all these girls over to meet him.

188
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,200
He might find someone he likes, right?

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,132
Just stay out of this.

190
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:58,160
Given his personality, who knows what trouble he'll cause you?

191
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,536
He…

192
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:02,640
He might have some misunderstandings about me.

193
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,612
But in my opinion, we are married after all,

194
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,360
and he's my stepson.

195
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,152
I want the best for him.

196
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,272
Take a look.

197
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,108
You should not interfere.

198
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,380
He told me he has a girlfriend.

199
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,300
What?

200
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,340
Has he a girlfriend?

201
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,440
<i>I've received your email.</i>

202
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,280
<i>You said you had further contact with that girl.</i>

203
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,460
<i>Did you get any severe allergic reactions?</i>

204
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,752
None.

205
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,200
<i>This is a very important signal.</i>

206
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,800
<i>It shows she may cure your haphephobia.</i>

207
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,200
<i>Next, you should have deeper contact with her</i>

208
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
<i>and find the cause.</i>

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,040
What do you mean by "deeper"?

210
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,320
<i>For example, morning hugs, goodnight kisses–</i>

211
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,300
I'm sorry, Doctor. What you said may not be possible in China.

212
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,320
<i>If not goodnight kisses, how about morning kisses?</i>

213
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,620
- Well–
<i>- All right, I'm busy now.</i>

214
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,620
<i>Let's talk about this later. Bye.</i>

215
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,380
<i>For example, morning hugs, goodnight kisses…</i>

<i>If not goodnight kisses, how about morning kisses?</i>

217

- Yi Chen, when did you get a girlfriend?

221
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,016
<i>Why didn't you tell me? I was thinking of you.</i>

222
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,680
<i>I'll come see you. I worry about you.

223
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,420
<i>- Is your girlfriend at your place? I'm coming over.

<i>You brat, what were you thinking?</i>

228
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,560
The blind date was all set last night.

229
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,160
The boy waited there for you two hours!

230
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,440
Why did you stand him up?

231
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,676
Oh no, I completely forgot about that.

232
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:30,200
<i>Don't try to lie to me.</i>

233
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,860
You didn't want to go at all!

234
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,480
<i>You even lied that you were there.</i>

235
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,960
<i>You brat, do you know</i>

236
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,220
how embarrassed I was in front of my friends yesterday?

237
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,040
And how many times must I apologize to Auntie Shen on your behalf?

238
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,960
Sorry, Mom, but I really forgot.

239
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,580
Yesterday, my boss…

240

<i>Mom, my boss is calling.</i>

244
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,536
I can't talk with you now. Bye. Have a nice trip.

245
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:02,810
Zhao Nuan Nuan!

246
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,620
That child is simply outrageous!

247
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,924
No.

248
00:16:12,924 --> 00:16:17,940
It seems that I, the Empress Mother, must take action myself.

249
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,920
Can't you stop interfering in their lives and let them be?

250
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,320
What are you saying?

251
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,780
You spoiled both of our children!

252
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,700
It's not just Zhao Nuan Nuan. Your precious son, Zhao Ming Yang, has problems.

253
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,220
He hasn't called over two weeks.

254
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,100
Are they going to fly into the sky?

255
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,380
N-No, they just want to stand with the sun.

256
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,136
"Stand with the sun"?

257
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:49,660
I tell you. Once I deal with these two little brats,

258
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,040
I'll handle you.

259
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm so angry.

Yes.

263
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,840
I think I caught a cold yesterday.

264
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,020
Now I have a headache, a stomachache, and a backache.

265
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,080
So can I take a break today?

Do you do housework at home?

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,944
As long as she's around, she will surely take good care of me, right?

321
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,952
Will she?

322
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,080
Let's eat.

323
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,400
Eat more.

324
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,280
Yi Chen doesn't eat carrots.

325
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,480
I...

326
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,592
do eat them.

327
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:48,100
I'll eat anything she gives me.

328
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:29,784
Nuan Nuan, you should eat more, too.

329
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,360
No need.

330
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,440
You don't have to do this.

331
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,220
Eat more.

332
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,268
Is it delicious?

333
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,120
It's my usual day off.

334
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,360
But I had to work until now.

335
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,980
How many more relatives do you have?

336
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,300
Three older male cousins, four older female cousins, several uncles,

337
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,220
and some younger male cousins.

338
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:42,612
No way.

339
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:46,880
Don't other company's bosses have just a few family members

340
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,520
and hardly any relatives?

341
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,920
Unfortunately, I am a boss

342
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,232
with a big family.

343
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,120
But, President Gu, could you please not make me act with you at night anymore?

344
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,060
I'll miss the last bus.

345
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,140
What if my relatives come at night?

346
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,660
Don't forget that your work hours are 24 hours a day.

347
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,040
No way. Nights should be overtime with double pay.

356
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,376
Zhao Nuan Nuan, you were actually swayed by that annoying guy.

357
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:59,160
What did he just say?

358
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,860
He would give me whatever I…

359
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Isn't he too good at this?

360
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,980
Who told me he's a cold CEO?

361
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,320
The way he acted just now…

362
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,280
No, no! Zhao Nuan Nuan, wake up!

363
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,260
He's your boss.

364
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,600
And you're just a janitor in his office.

365
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,360
Wake up. Wake up.

366
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,420
I went upstairs with the west wind

367
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,240
and looked back… looked back…

368
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,972
What's the matter?

369
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:36,156
Sorry, Director, I choked.

370
00:26:36,156 --> 00:26:38,044
I'll try again in a bit.

371
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,320
Boss, are you okay?

372
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,700
You looked bad when you came here the other day.

373
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,580
And your voice is hoarse today.

374
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,920
Garlic, chili, and vinegar.

375
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,160
I'm already a legend as a voice-actor for still being alive.

376
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,640
It's okay. I'll be fine after I rest a moment.

377
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,560
I'll move today, no matter what.

378
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,768
Otherwise, I'll surely die by her hands.

379
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,520
There should be no one here.

380
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,680
Good. I'll take my luggage and leave.

381
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,472
What's that noise?

382
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,220
Did I mishear?

383
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,320
I heard it. I heard it again!

384
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,400
It's not a hallucination this time.

385
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,240
It's next door, in Nuan Nuan's room.

386
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,736
Who's there? What are you doing?

387
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:02,800
Why are you…

388
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,680
Big Sister Xin Ran, are you watching a horror movie again?

389
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,704
If you're scared, don't watch scary movies every day.

390
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,600
Sorry, I went in the wrong room.

391
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,360
I can't see without my glasses.

392
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,880
I'll leave first. Have a nice weekend. Good night!

393
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,960
Zhao Nuan Nuan!

394
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,580
Big Sister Xin Ran…

395
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,200
What's going on? Tell me!

396
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,400
- It's not my fault. He insisted on staying.
- It's not my fault. She told me to stay.

397
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,088
- I didn't stay for long.
- You weren't staying long.

398
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,592
Whoever confesses will get leniency.

399
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:14,600
Big Sister Xin Ran, this tactless guy is not a bad person.

400
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,760
He's my...

401
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,780
He's my younger twin brother.

402
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,120
I showed you his photo before.

403
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,560
He recently graduated.

404
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,460
He had a job in Shanghai,

405
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,420
but for some reason, he quit.

406
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,260
He insisted that he had a project here and wanted to stay with me.

407
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,760
You know my situation.

408
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,640
I lack money to rent him a place or pay his hotel.

409
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,960
So I had to let him stay a few days.

410
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,000
But I clearly told him to move out soon.

411
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,352
I didn't know he would sneak back and give you such a scare.

412
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:50,400
Who sneaked back?

413
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,560
I came to pack my luggage and move out.

414
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,600
And you told me to come back when your roommate wasn't around.

415
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,960
- When did I ever say that?
- You did.

416
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,280
Whose idea was it?

417
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,240
- It's his.
- It's hers.

418
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,360
- It's definitely his.
- It's definitely hers.

419
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,080
Enough, you two!

420
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,360
One brought your brother here and didn't tell me for such a long time.

421
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,920
One hid under the bed and sneaked around,

422
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,040
almost giving me a heart attack.

423
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,120
You really are siblings.

424
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,980
I beg you to get along forever

425
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,960
and never separate!

426
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,380
Big Sister Xin Ran, don't be angry.

427
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,404
You're right. It's all his fault.

428
00:31:36,404 --> 00:31:38,060
He came back without telling me.

429
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,580
See what he did to Big Sister.

430
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,320
You're no better. Sit down.

431
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,216
Fine, I won't hold a grudge.

432
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:55,640
Our fate as roommates ends here.

433
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,840
Let's pack up

434
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,800
and go our separate ways.

435
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,380
Stop, Big Sister Xin Ran.

436
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,680
You can't give up this lush forest like me

437
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,180
just for one bad leaf like him.

438
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,140
Big Sister Xin Ran, please forgive me this time.

439
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,220
I promise I won't do this again.

440
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,680
In the future, I won't hide anything from you.

441
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:33,180
Big Sister Xin Ran.

442
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,260
Fine, you don't need to leave.

443
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,032
I'll leave.

444
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,200
This is my advance payment for the project.

445
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,980
It was originally meant for Zhao Nuan Nuan.

446
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,280
But I'll give it all to you two as my rent for my stay.

447
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,760
Don't be angry anymore.

448
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,400
Although she's careless and unlucky,

449
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,360
my sister is a kind friend and a good roommate.

450
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,820
Zhao Ming Yang, you big fool!

451
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,760
Why give them all the project money you received?

452
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,780
Now you don't even have money for a cab.

453
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,120
Don't pretend to be a saint,

454
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,960
or you'll get struck by lightning.

455
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,220
No way.

456
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,260
I won't be as unlucky as Zhao Nuan Nuan,

457
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,280
who encounters rain on a clear night, right?

458
00:33:44,744 --> 00:33:46,232
Never mind.

459
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,220
I'll go stay with Old Jin for the night.

460
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,892
<i>[Old Jin: Boss, my girlfriend is here today.]</i>

461
00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:56,940
- I can't hang out with you tonight.
- Oh no!

462
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,500
Now you're all about your girlfriend.

463
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,900
Forget it.

464
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,260
As long as Zhao Nuan Nuan doesn't fight with her roommate

465
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,000
and is free from bad luck,

466
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,590
it's worth my sleeping in a garden.

467
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:20,952
Besides, I really don't want to see her roommate,

468
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:24,280
the she-devil!
