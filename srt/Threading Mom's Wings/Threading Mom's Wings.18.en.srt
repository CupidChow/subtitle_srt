1
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,399
Yinyin,

2
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,040
tonight is your Grandma Mu's birthday banquet.

3
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,599
Are you ready?

4
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,239
Mom,

5
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,239
do you think I look good in this dress?

6
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,159
You look great.

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,599
Our Yinyin looks good in anything.

8
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,280
But after all, it's your Grandma Mu's birthday banquet.

9
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,319
We can't steal the spotlight from the birthday lady.

10
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,000
That would be impolite.

11
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,560
Steal the spotlight?

12
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,959
I should be the main character of this banquet anyway.

13
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,920
If Lin Han hadn't suddenly appeared,

14
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,519
my childhood engagement with Huiming wouldn't have been called off.

15
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,879
Yinyin, are you crazy?

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,040
You absolutely can't do this.

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,480
What if someone finds out?

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,159
Your reputation will be completely ruined.

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,359
What reputation?

20
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,799
She's a woman who's been married twice,

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,480
yet she still took my place as Mrs. Ying.

22
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,879
You always talk about being a proper lady,

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
but I don't think it helps at all.

24
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,000
Yinyin.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,400
Mom.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
Aren't you happy that I want to marry the person I love?

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,239
Or are you, just like Grandma Mu and Brother Huiming,

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,400
all fooled by her?

29
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,280
If that's the case,

30
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,680
why don't you just let her be your daughter instead?

31
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,360
Oh, Yinyin.

32
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,400
That's not what I meant.

33
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,639
Alright, I'll help you.

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,879
But who will be wronged then?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,960
I can't let my precious darling be wronged.

36
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,199
No matter what happens tonight,

37
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,120
I must be the one engaged to Brother Ying.

38
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,360
Lin Han, you'd better know your place.

39
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,639
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,080
Mom.

41
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,879
You look so beautiful today.

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,879
When Uncle Ying sees you later,

43
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,960
he'll definitely be dazzled by you.

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,759
This is my first time wearing clothes like this.

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,319
You're making me feel shy with your compliments.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Mom, when I grow up,

47
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,159
I'll buy you even more beautiful clothes.

48
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,000
Even when my mom is eighty,

49
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,800
she'll still be the most beautiful old lady.

50
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,159
Am I really that beautiful?

51
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,000
Of course!

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,800
Mom, do a twirl for me.

53
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,479
I want to see.

54
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,639
Be careful.

55
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,680
Why are you here?

56
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,439
Didn't we say Xiaowan and I could go by ourselves?

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,520
I couldn't wait.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
I just wanted to see you as soon as possible.

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Han, dear

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,439
You look so beautiful today.

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,639
Thank you, Grandma.

62
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,680
Grandma

63
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,639
Look at Han's dress.

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,439
I picked it out for her myself.

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,720
So, what do you think? Does your grandson have good taste?

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,959
You little rascal.

67
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,319
I’ll admit, you have good taste.

68
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,519
In Grandma’s eyes,

69
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,120
I can’t see anything anymore.

70
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,759
Great-grandma

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,680
You can’t even see us anymore?

72
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,720
I can, I can.

73
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,120
Great-grandma

74
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,879
I spend all day hoping you’ll come visit me.

75
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,720
Huiming

76
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:55,519
Grandma

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,560
Why don’t we go inside first?

78
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,399
Mom, I just did a fortune reading.

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,800
In a little while,

80
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,839
someone’s going to have bad luck.

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,199
Everyone, just relax.

82
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,199
As long as I have close contact with Huiming in front of everyone,

83
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,920
even if it’s just for the sake of the Han and Liu families’ reputation,

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,759
Huiming won’t be able to refuse to marry me.

85
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,360
Huiming won’t be able to refuse to marry me.

86
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
Huiming

87
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,000
Huiming, it really hurts.

88
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,079
Huiming.

89
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,639
Yinyin.

90
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,720
How about getting up quickly?

91
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,720
Did you hurt yourself when you fell?

92
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,360
Miss Liu, it's great to be young.

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,240
You can sleep anywhere you go.

94
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,439
I don't even know why lately,

95
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,879
every time someone sees me,

96
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,160
I twist my ankle.

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,680
It's not like I do it on purpose.

98
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,519
If it were you,

99
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,959
I'd be happy to.

100
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,120
Lin Han.

101
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,720
Did you push my daughter?

102
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,800
Aunt Lu.

103
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,759
Lately, your daughter

104
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,439
is either falling or twisting her ankle.

105
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,879
I think it might be a bone issue.

106
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,439
If you have time, I can give you an acupuncture treatment.

107
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,240
I guarantee it'll cure you right away.

108
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,560
Let's go, there's nothing more to see.

109
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,759
You think you can become a spirit after just a few years as a fox?

110
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,160
Trying to seduce my grandson right under my nose.

111
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,439
Keep dreaming.

112
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,600
You all should eat more.

113
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,399
Enjoy your meal.

114
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,360
Come on, let's go over there.

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,959
Are you hurt at all?

116
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,319
Let's go rest in the lounge.

117
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,079
I'm not going anywhere.

118
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,000
If it doesn't work this time, there will be another chance.

119
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,079
If I leave,

120
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,560
Huiming will really belong to someone else.

121
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,240
Yinyin, you saw it all.

122
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,120
Huiming doesn't have any feelings for you at all.

123
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Do you still want to keep going?

124
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:37,920
Mom.

125
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,120
I'm just pursuing my own happiness.

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,600
Are you going to help me or not?

127
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,560
Okay.

128
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,800
Thank you, everyone.

129
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,040
For taking time out of your busy schedules to attend my birthday banquet.

130
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,920
Today,

131
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,800
I have another very important announcement to make.

132
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
Starting today,

133
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,519
all business matters of the Ying family

134
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,879
will be handled by Huiming.

135
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,480
At the same time, I would like to formally introduce

136
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,800
my future granddaughter-in-law,

137
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,800
Lin Han.

138
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Aunt Mu, my daughter is missing.

139
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,360
Madam.

140
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,720
Madam.

141
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,639
Miss Liu and Young Master Ying seem to be trapped in the lounge.

142
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,519
Huiming,

143
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,679
today is Grandma's birthday.

144
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,960
I specially prepared a good bottle of wine.

145
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I just want to share it with you.

146
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,480
Look at the dress I bought just for today.

147
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,200
Is it pretty?

148
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,360
Cheers.

149
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,639
Cheers.

150
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,799
Huiming,

151
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,919
how are you feeling?

152
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,559
It's so hot in this room.

153
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,360
This air conditioner...

154
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,600
Why is it so hot even with the AC on?

155
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,159
Huiming,

156
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,639
Yinyin,

157
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,279
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

158
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,799
I'm going to the bathroom.

159
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,759
Then hurry back.

160
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,799
I'll wait for you.

161
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,159
Huiming,

162
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,039
why did you take so long to come back?

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,399
Huiming,
