1
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,959
I'm not dead.

2
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,959
I've come back.

3
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,359
Jin Hanliang.

4
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,760
That's right.

5
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,120
It's 1992 now.

6
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,000
Today is my wedding day.

7
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,480
My daughter Xiaowan

8
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,200
has not been born yet.

9
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,079
What exactly is going on?

10
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,760
It's her obsession

11
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,040
that brought you back.

12
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,560
Lin Han.

13
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,400
The chance to choose again is right in front of you.

14
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,680
How will you choose?

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Choose again...

16
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,840
I can still choose again?

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,159
Open the door.

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,680
Time to welcome the bride!

19
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,120
Jin Hanliang.

20
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,800
He's just a jerk.

21
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,120
But Xiaowan...

22
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,159
If I don't marry him,

23
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,800
what about Xiaowan?

24
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,319
Will she still come into this world?

25
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,479
I know

26
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,680
I married the wrong person.

27
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,919
But I don't regret it.

28
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,039
Because for a mother,

29
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,080
heaven has already given me

30
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,120
the best,

31
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,560
most precious gift.

32
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,439
Having Xiaowan as my daughter,

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,639
I'd trade anything for that.

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,120
I can't believe I didn't notice

35
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,080
that in my previous life, I didn't even have a hair ornament.

36
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,560
It was Mom.

37
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,680
Mom had already come back long ago.

38
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,360
You took so long.

39
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
I thought you weren't going to get married.

40
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:13,520
Get married?

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,439
Of course I'm getting married.

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,040
Mom.

43
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,040
Xiaowan.

44
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,639
Don't be afraid.

45
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,920
Mom is back.

46
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,439
In this life,

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,720
I will definitely protect you well.

48
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,720
Mom.

49
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,199
You came back a long time ago, didn't you?

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,519
You clearly came back even earlier than I did.

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,519
You could have changed all of this.

52
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,160
Why did you still repeat the same mistakes?

53
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:50,959
Child.

54
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,800
I'm not repeating the same mistakes.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm choosing to keep

56
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,720
the happiest part of my life.

57
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,639
Lin Han, you're already married,

58
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,680
yet you're still so restless.

59
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,319
Why are you studying traditional Chinese medicine?

60
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,839
Do you think just because you

61
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,759
attend a few classes

62
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,600
and read a few books,

63
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,120
you can really become a miracle doctor?

64
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,560
How ridiculous.

65
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,480
I've never wanted to be a miracle doctor.

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,439
I just want to save my daughter.

67
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,759
So she can avoid the fate of being deaf and lame in this life.

68
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,680
Let her live peacefully

69
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,360
and grow up healthy.

70
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,800
My Xiaowan, don't worry.

71
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,839
This time, Mom will protect you.

72
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,319
So that's why you studied traditional Chinese medicine.

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,839
It was to avoid the regrets of your past life.

74
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,079
I only just found out

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,920
that behind all these years of my safe upbringing

76
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,319
you were always silently making sacrifices.

77
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,240
Xiaowan

78
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,920
Mom doesn't have much time left.

79
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,920
I've prepared your birthday gifts for each year in advance.

80
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,160
From now until you turn eighteen,

81
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,639
and even until you get married.

82
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,720
I wanted to watch you grow up little by little.

83
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,079
And dress you in these clothes myself.

84
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,920
But now,

85
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,279
Mom might not be able to do that.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,839
In my previous life,

87
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,800
your seventh birthday wish was for a pink princess dress.

88
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,240
But unfortunately, Mom was useless.

89
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,600
I didn't get to see you wear it before I left.

90
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,480
My Xiaowan,

91
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,399
when you put on this dress,

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,439
you'll definitely look like a little princess.

93
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,000
After you start school,

94
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,360
you'll make many new friends.

95
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,040
And learn a lot of new things.

96
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,160
Mom won't be able to be by your side.

97
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,399
But you must remember,

98
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,879
no matter when or where,

99
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,720
always be a kind and brave child.

100
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,639
My daughter,

101
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,600
the wedding dress I prepared for you is beautiful, isn't it?

102
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,279
But Mom isn't in a hurry to marry you off.

103
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,720
I just want to say,

104
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,199
if you meet someone who truly treats you well in the future,

105
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,519
and makes you feel happy to marry him,

106
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,519
with joy in your heart,

107
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,040
then wear this wedding dress,

108
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,959
and get married with pride.

109
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,639
But if you don't meet that person,

110
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,560
or if you're happy living on your own,

111
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,279
that's perfectly fine too.

112
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,360
Your happiness

113
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,399
is up to you to decide.

114
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,920
No matter what you choose,

115
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,000
I will always support you.

116
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,160
I will always love you.

117
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,200
No matter where I am,

118
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,159
remember,

119
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,440
I will always be your strongest support.

120
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,639
Xiaowan,

121
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,480
stay strong.

122
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,559
Xiaowan,

123
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,519
I checked.

124
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,200
The stocks and properties you asked your mom to buy,

125
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,480
she bought them all.

126
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,080
Mom,

127
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,159
so you always believed in me.

128
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,399
You just didn't want me to know.

129
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,960
You didn't want me to worry.

130
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,519
I thought I was here to cheer you up.

131
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,320
But it was you

132
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,240
who was making my dream come true.

133
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,519
Xiaowan,

134
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,600
Mom,

135
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,840
wait for me, don't go.

136
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,240
Mom

137
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,080
Mom

138
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,000
Do you know?

139
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,039
During this time

140
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,440
I feel like I had a very, very long dream

141
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,720
In the dream, I went back to the past

142
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,200
Trying to change some things

143
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,000
So you could have a better life

144
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,600
Really?

145
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,600
Then I must have been very happy in the dream

146
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,600
Xiaowan

147
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,519
Actually, I have a secret too

148
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,039
I never told you

149
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
What secret, Mom?

150
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,679
In this dream

151
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,679
Mom was actually awake too

152
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,399
And I also knew

153
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,240
My Xiaowan

154
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,360
came back from the future

155
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,440
Mom

156
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,360
When did you find out?

157
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,720
From the first time you stood in front of me

158
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
You are my daughter

159
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,440
What could you possibly hide from me?

160
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,639
Mom, do you trust me?

161
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,039
As long as we leave Dad,

162
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,080
we can still live a good life.

163
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,200
Okay.

164
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
In three days,

165
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,679
my mom and I will pay off the debt.

166
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,120
You

167
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,519
will divorce my mom.

168
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,919
Drawing lots to tell fortunes.

169
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,080
Seeking guidance from heaven and earth.

170
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,120
Asking about the future and relationships.

171
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,440
Divining and asking questions—how do you know all this?

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
Mom, do you believe me?

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,039
Within an hour,

174
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,240
someone will come to help you solve your problem.

175
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,720
Has the clothing factory had a batch of goods recently

176
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,639
that are stuck and can't be sold?

177
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:11,679
My mom

178
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,960
is the person who will help you solve the problem.

179
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,159
Watch me perform a big magic trick.

180
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:27,679
Second

181
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,919
Happy divorce

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,720
I want you to live freely for once

183
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,799
Go pursue your own happiness

184
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,519
Everything you've done for Mom

185
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,879
Mom knows it all in her heart

186
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,720
But Mom also wants to tell you

187
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,080
No matter when

188
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,960
Mom's greatest happiness

189
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,320
is having you, my Xiaowan

190
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,679
Your health

191
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,480
Your happiness

192
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
are more important than anything

193
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,960
Mom

194
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,399
I

195
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,639
I thought

196
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,159
I could change something

197
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,080
But I realized

198
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,759
the most important thing

199
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,919
is being with you

200
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,799
every minute

201
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:25,960
every moment

202
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,159
Silly child

203
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,080
You made me understand

204
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,600
that our love

205
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,000
can transcend all time

206
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:49,879
and space

207
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,240
Xiaowan

208
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,080
This is your dream

209
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,879
You should go back

210
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,559
Remember

211
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,879
no matter when or where

212
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,080
Mom will always be

213
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,919
your strongest support

214
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:21,799
Xiaowan

215
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,559
Goodbye

216
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,720
Doctor

217
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,320
How is it today

218
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,039
Nothing much

219
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:57,879
Come here.

220
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,120
See what kind of soup I made for you today.
