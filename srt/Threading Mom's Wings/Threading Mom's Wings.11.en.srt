1
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,879
Brother

2
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,599
I heard from people in town

3
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,359
that Lin Han can make a lot of money now.

4
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,359
Besides,

5
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,280
our village has never had a rule about divorce.

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,599
Even if you get divorced,

7
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,920
she's still your wife.

8
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,680
She's still our family's money-maker.

9
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,359
Lin Han

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,959
Look at you.

11
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,799
They say a day as a couple means a hundred days of kindness.

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,640
If you come back and live with me,

13
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:31,879
I'll let bygones be bygones.

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,920
Jin Hanliang, keep dreaming.

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,400
Even if I die in this life,

16
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,400
I will never look at you again.

17
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,079
Brother

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,959
I've said it before,

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,120
dealing with a woman as fickle as her,

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,760
reasoning with her is useless.

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,040
As for her,

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,239
you have to make her suffer for it to work.

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,280
Got it.

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,879
If she won't take the soft approach,

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll have to use force.

26
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,200
You brought this on yourself.

27
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,120
Don't blame me.

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Lock her in the ancestral hall first.

29
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,159
Let her go hungry for a night.

30
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,560
As long as she's in our Xiangshui Village,

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,000
anyone who dares to come for her

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,879
is going against our village.

33
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,159
Mom, are you in there?

34
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:22,919
Mom.

35
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:23,840
Mom.

36
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,719
Mom, are you inside?

37
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,560
What did you say to Su Mingyue?

38
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,680
Let my mom out.

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,879
Nonsense.

40
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,199
I went to the garment factory this afternoon to see you and your mom.

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,319
I left when I didn't see you.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,319
I don't believe you.

43
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,159
Go in and see for yourself.

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,400
See if your mom is really there.

45
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:45,840
Mom.

46
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:48,599
Mom.

47
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,520
Mom.

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,800
She's not there, is she?

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm your dad, would I lie to you?

50
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,199
You know very well whether I'm lying or not.

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,680
If you don't tell me where my mom is,

52
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,319
I'll call the police right now.

53
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,199
Let the police find her.

54
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:09,960
She's in the warehouse.

55
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,840
Do you want to know which warehouse your mom is being held in?

56
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,520
No need to call the police.

57
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,280
I'll take you there.

58
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,199
Mom

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,479
Mom

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,680
Mom

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,039
Mom

62
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,560
Mom, are you there?

63
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,560
Jin Hanliang, where's my mom?

64
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,280
Didn't you say she was right here?

65
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,879
What trick are you trying to pull this time?

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I don't believe I can't find my mom if I call the police.

67
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,360
Hey

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,319
Give it here

69
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
I'm your father

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,120
Haven't seen you in a few days

71
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,879
How dare you shout at me so loudly

72
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,560
Let go of me

73
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,919
Neither you nor your mom are leaving

74
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,680
Let go of me

75
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,919
Your mom belongs to the Jin family as long as she's alive

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,560
And even in death, she's still a Jin family ghost

77
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,599
Fine

78
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,280
Just wait here

79
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,240
Wait until I calm your mom down

80
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,240
Then the three of us can reunite as a family

81
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,080
And live a good life together

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,279
Lin Han

83
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,959
So you’re actually this capable.

84
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,920
I really underestimated you before.

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,240
As long as you’re willing to come back to me,

86
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,639
from now on, you’ll have the final say in this family.

87
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,480
As for the past,

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
let’s just wipe the slate clean.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,279
Jin Hanliang

90
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,079
Don’t even dream about it.

91
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,519
Before, it was for Xiaowan’s sake

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,199
that I put up with everything and stayed with your Jin family.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,120
Now, it’s still for Xiaowan

94
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,879
but I won’t live like I did before anymore.

95
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,360
So you refuse a toast and want a punishment instead, huh?

96
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,199
Today, in front of all the Jin ancestors,

97
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,360
I’ll teach you a good lesson.

98
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,439
Get up.

99
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,959
This—

100
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,120
You forced me to do this.

101
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:45,480
It’s okay now.

102
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,240
I’m here.

103
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,360
Get up.

104
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,199
Jin Hanliang

105
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,920
I’m only letting this go for Xiaowan’s father’s sake.

106
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,519
This is my final warning to you.

107
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,959
If you dare touch Lin Han again,

108
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,839
I’ll beat you every time I see you.

109
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,439
If you dare take her away,

110
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,480
I’ll ruin her reputation.

111
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,079
She’ll never be able to hold her head up again.

112
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,279
She’ll live in a nightmare forever.

113
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,199
The one who should be living a nightmare isn’t her

114
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,439
it’s you.

115
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,079
Lin Han

116
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,680
Director Ying

117
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,000
Why are you here?

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,439
Why are you here?

119
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,519
This has something to do with you.

120
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,600
It has nothing to do with me.

121
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,399
It's not up to you to decide whether it concerns you.

122
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,079
I will get to the bottom of this.

123
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,120
Anyone who has hurt Lin Han

124
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,240
I won't let a single one of them go.

125
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,839
Stop!

126
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,839
What a lousy factory director.

127
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,800
Stop telling me all this nonsense.

128
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Let me tell you, Lin Han.

129
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,160
You belong to the Jin family as long as you live.

130
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,600
And even in death, you’re still a Jin.

131
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,399
Without my permission,

132
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,759
let’s see if you dare step out of this door today.

133
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,759
I’m taking her with me today, no matter what.

134
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,920
Just try me.

135
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:07,879
Everyone,

136
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,360
everyone,

137
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,399
you all saw it.

138
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,240
This woman cheated on me and wants a divorce.

139
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,160
Her lover even beat me up.

140
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,040
Oh, everyone,

141
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
just look at this.

142
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
They even beat up my son.

143
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,279
They’re bullying us, a widow and her child.

144
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,199
Shameless.

145
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,879
This is just too much.

146
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,079
Her lover actually came here in broad daylight and started a fight.

147
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Director Ying,

148
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,920
You don’t really know my sister-in-law.

149
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:34,759
She’s just—

150
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,519
Ah!

151
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,639
Ouch!

152
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,040
They even hit my daughter.

153
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,040
You shameless thing, you even hit me!

154
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,360
Don’t push people too far!

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,560
Jin Hanliang and I divorced a long time ago.

156
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,199
Both emotionally and legally,

157
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,560
who I’m with

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,439
has nothing

159
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,480
to do with you or the Jin family.

160
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,720
Then what about this letter?

161
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,439
You wrote this to your pen pal.

162
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,759
The letter is so intimate.

163
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,120
So you never went to his workplace to look for him?

164
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,319
It's better that I didn't.

165
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,000
If I hadn't,

166
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,360
it means you wouldn't have married my useless dad.

167
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,040
This is...

168
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,439
Xiaowan wrote this imitating my tone.

169
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,759
I just mentioned it casually.

170
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,680
But she remembered it deeply.

171
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,079
And she acted on it.

172
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,439
She put so much thought into it.

173
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,320
All just to help me reunite with my first love.

174
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,720
She wanted me to have no regrets.

175
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,639
She was already behaving inappropriately before marriage.

176
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,639
No wonder after marriage,

177
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,519
she was seeing two people at once.

178
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,240
She's single now.

179
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,679
I'm the one who wants to pursue her.

180
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,000
Director Ying,

181
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,519
how could you possibly like

182
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,080
a divorced woman like her?

183
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,720
Does it matter to you who I like?

184
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Divorce is her past.

185
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,200
What I want is her as a person,

186
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,279
and her future.

187
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
He and I are just pen pals, nothing more.

188
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,519
You can read the letters if you want.

189
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:13,399
No need.

190
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,080
I trust you.

191
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,039
I've never seen anyone so eager to be taken advantage of.

192
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,080
Lin Han,

193
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,639
If you and your lover are really innocent,

194
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,240
then how do you explain

195
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,840
keeping a cheap pen he gave you for so many years?

196
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,679
This pen...

197
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,639
This pen...

198
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,960
is...

199
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,919
Lin Han,

200
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,000
I am Liming.
