1
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,280
Mom

2
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,799
Once we get to Shanghai

3
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,840
we have to make it big

4
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,719
we're going to make a lot of money

5
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,359
and live in a big apartment

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,319
Mom

7
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,719
What are you looking at?

8
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,560
This was when you were a hundred days old

9
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,760
Time really flies

10
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,799
In the blink of an eye

11
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,840
you've grown up so much

12
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,000
Mom, you must have been really beautiful back then

13
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,280
It's a pity I couldn't see what you were like before

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,480
What is it?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,719
Now that I'm old

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,719
are you starting to dislike me?

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,359
Are you starting to dislike me?

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,159
Already starting to dislike me

19
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,719
You dislike me, don't you?

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,000
You dislike me, don't you?

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,280
Mom

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,959
I want to ask you

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,840
Did you draw all these pictures?

24
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,560
Back then

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,040
our family wasn't well off

26
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,879
we didn't have the chance to keep more photos or videos

27
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,079
so I used a paintbrush

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,319
to capture every important moment of yours

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
Then tell me

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,479
what are the stories behind these paintings?

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,800
Look at this one

32
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,479
This is when you first learned to walk

33
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,759
You walked really awkwardly back then

34
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,719
so I had to make this the first one

35
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,039
And this is when you first called me "Mom"

36
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,120
Mom

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,800
Luckily, I came back.

38
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,719
Fortunately, I wasn't too late.

39
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,639
Everything in this life is changing.

40
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,520
The only thing that doesn't change

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,599
is your love for me.

42
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,080
Xiaowan,

43
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,159
remember this,

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,879
from now on,

45
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,479
whether Mom is here or not,

46
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,039
you must eat well and take care of yourself.

47
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,599
Mom's only wish

48
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,560
is for you to be healthy.

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,680
And to see more of the world outside.

50
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,400
Mom,

51
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,000
are you going to leave me and elope with Uncle Ying?

52
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,599
Silly child,

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,840
Mom will never leave you, no matter what.

54
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,080
In my heart,

55
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,919
Xiaowan will always be the most important.

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,199
Mom,

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,960
go ahead and fall in love.

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,080
It's okay.

59
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,919
I'm already a big kid now.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,680
Xiaowan

61
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,719
Mom wishes she could stay with you a little longer.

62
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,399
Just a little longer.

63
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,040
Sister Lin Han

64
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,240
Wishing you a safe journey.

65
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,600
Thank you.

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,800
Thank you.

67
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,120
Xiaowan

68
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,680
Don't forget to send us postcards after you arrive in Shanghai.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,759
Thank you, everyone.

70
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:39,920
We

71
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,279
will miss you all too.

72
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,680
Goodbye, everyone.

73
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,120
We'll come back to visit you.

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Alright, everyone get back to work.

75
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,160
Goodbye.

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,920
Work hard, everyone.

77
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,360
Take a photo for us.

78
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:57,879
Okay.

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,439
Three, two, one, cheese!

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Space is precious in Shanghai.

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,199
You’re new there and not familiar with the place.

82
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,319
I've already had my family prepare a room.

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,120
If you don't mind,

84
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,040
you can stay at my place.

85
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,160
Wouldn't that be too much trouble?

86
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,240
We'd better just rent a place.

87
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,600
It's just a man and a woman alone,

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,600
and I have a child with me.

89
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,240
It definitely wouldn't be convenient.

90
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,800
No,

91
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
I don't live alone.

92
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,399
Miss Lin Han

93
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,680
Do I really look that improper?

94
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,040
I...

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,279
No, that's not it.

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,160
I...

97
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
I just...

98
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,639
Even though I also want to

99
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,519
be officially recognized and have a proper status,

100
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,639
I'll still wait for the day when you truly want it.

101
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,839
So,

102
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,920
can you feel at ease coming home with me now?

103
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,079
Don't worry.

104
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,800
Absolutely, no worries.

105
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,079
Mom, just go with Uncle Ying.

106
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,079
Alright, okay.

107
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,439
Uncle Ying, you promised me.

108
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,600
Once everything is settled, you'll take me to have fun in Shanghai.

109
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,680
Sure, and not just take you to have fun,

110
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
I can give you anything you want.

111
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,399
Is that okay?

112
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:23,879
Mom

113
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,320
When are you going to let Uncle Ying officially become my dad?

114
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,320
You...

115
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,679
See, my mom is picking on me again.

116
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,720
Let's go, let's get something tasty to eat.

117
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,159
Ma'am, your husband is really wonderful.

118
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,600
He loves both his wife and daughter so much.

119
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,440
A daughter who grows up in a family like this

120
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,679
will definitely be confident and outstanding.

121
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,159
Thank you.

122
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,519
Yes.

123
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,120
In a previous life,

124
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
I don't think I've ever seen

125
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,120
Xiaowan smile so happily before.

126
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,639
Thank you for your hard work today.

127
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,240
You accompanied me for such a long time.

128
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,840
It's nothing, not hard at all.

129
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
Yuyuan Garden is just over there.

130
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,399
Do you want to go take a look?

131
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,519
No need, don't trouble yourself.

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,480
I bought something for you.

133
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,200
See if you like it.

134
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,559
Hello.

135
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,759
Please wrap this for me.

136
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,240
Sure, please wait a moment.

137
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,600
Let me put it on for you.

138
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,679
I can hardly breathe.

139
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,720
Let me do it.

140
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,799
Does it look good?

141
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,240
It looks good.

142
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,960
Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something.

143
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,879
Xiaowan really likes you.

144
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,639
She also really wants

145
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,200
to have a complete family.

146
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,919
And I don't want to let her down.

147
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,480
So

148
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,759
could I ask you

149
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,320
to pretend to be my partner for a while?

150
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,799
Don't worry, it won't take up too much of your time.

151
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,480
Just until December 31st this year.

152
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,399
As soon as we get past New Year's,

153
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,559
our relationship will officially be over.

154
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,919
Is that okay?

155
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,120
Is it really just pretend?

156
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,240
But what if I'm serious?
