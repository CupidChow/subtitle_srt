1
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,280
Aunt Mu

2
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,680
I came here specifically to apologize to you on behalf of my daughter.

3
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,599
She's still young.

4
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,840
If she said anything inappropriate,

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,959
I hope you can forgive her.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,640
Xueyan

7
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,439
I've watched you grow up.

8
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,280
All these years, I know you've cared for Yinyin.

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,200
It's because of that child back then, isn't it?

10
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,599
But you can't just spoil her out of affection.

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,599
And then neglect the child.

12
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,680
Aunt Mu

13
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,239
I only have this one daughter.

14
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,159
Whatever she wants,

15
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,719
even if it's the stars and the moon in the sky,

16
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,560
as long as I can,

17
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,159
I'll make it happen for her.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,879
I heard Huiming is back.

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,120
I brought some gifts and gave them to Aunt Zhao.

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,640
Xueyan

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,959
We've known each other for so many years.

22
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,359
We've both been through a lot.

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,640
The one thing in this world you can't force is feelings.

24
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,239
Great-grandmother

25
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,840
Are you feeling better?

26
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,120
Great-grandmother is much better now.

27
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,799
Come here.

28
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,400
Grandma will introduce you to your Aunt Lu.

29
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,919
Xueyan

30
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,039
Let me introduce you to my future granddaughter-in-law.

31
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:16,919
Lin Han

32
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,520
Granddaughter-in-law

33
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,800
I want to see what kind of person it is

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,879
who bullied my daughter like this.

35
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,280
Xiaohan

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,039
Hurry and greet your Aunt Lu.

37
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,039
Hello, Aunt Lu.

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,199
Xiaowan

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,080
Grandma Lu

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,680
Hello, Grandma Lu.

41
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,199
Come, sit down, sit down.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,680
Xueyan

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
I was wondering why Xiaohan looks so familiar.

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,960
She looks just like you did when you were young.

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,919
Really alike.

46
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,360
You're the miracle doctor who saved the old lady, right?

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
How old are you this year?

48
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,719
Twenty-eight.

49
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,599
Where is your family from?

50
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,159
I'm from Linyuan.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
But I got married early.

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,439
I've been living in Xiangshui ever since.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,719
Linyuan is at least a few thousand kilometers from here.

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,599
Qingwan was only half a year old when she went missing.

55
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,840
It's been over twenty years.

56
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,560
There can't be such a coincidence in this world.

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
But she really does look so much like I did when I was young.

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,599
Have you ever been to Shanghai before?

59
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
Do you have any other family members?

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,520
I...

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,840
Xueyan,

62
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,319
what are you doing?

63
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,199
All these questions

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,639
have confused Xiaohan.

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Come here, Wan.

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,879
Come over to great-grandma.

67
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,719
Great-grandma heard

68
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,479
that you love braised pork the most.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,759
I specially asked the cook to make it today.

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,759
You can eat as much as you want later.

71
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:17,959
Okay.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,959
Thank you, great-grandma.

73
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,920
So Grandma Lu's biological daughter

74
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,879
was stolen when she was very young.

75
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,399
Liu Yinyin is her adopted daughter.

76
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,560
That's right.

77
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,560
If your Grandma Lu's real daughter were still alive,

78
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,720
she would be about the same age as your mother.

79
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,480
Xiaohan,

80
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,480
don't blame your Aunt Lu for looking at you that way.

81
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,399
Because when your Aunt Lu was young,

82
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,959
she looked almost exactly like you do now.

83
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,920
Aunt Lu has never given up

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,319
searching for her own daughter.

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,199
Unfortunately, there's never been any news.

86
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Your Aunt Lu

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,759
dotes on Yinyin.

88
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,560
But this girl

89
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,120
is young but has a scheming mind.

90
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,600
Xiaohan,

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,120
you're the granddaughter-in-law that Grandma has chosen.

92
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,600
No one can replace you.

93
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,639
Here,

94
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,879
braised pork.

95
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,600
Eat up.

96
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,199
Which piece do you want?

97
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,319
Here,

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,720
the ear.

99
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,120
Here's the ear.

100
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,600
The pain of losing a daughter

101
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,319
and being separated by life and death

102
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,720
is truly hard to let go of.

103
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,000
If Xiaowan disappeared from my life,

104
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
I'm afraid I would also

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,439
Xiaowan,

106
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,120
it's wonderful that Mom has the chance to be by your side.

107
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,439
It's really nice.

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,800
The person who bullied my daughter

109
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,160
How could he look so much like I did when I was young?

110
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,800
Impossible.

111
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,720
It must just be a coincidence.

112
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,360
Mom.

113
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,360
Mom.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,879
Mom, what's wrong?

115
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,720
Someone help! My mom has fainted!

116
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,319
Someone help! My mom has fainted!

117
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,160
Go check on her!

118
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,800
I'll go take a look.

119
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:31,839
Oh no.

120
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,759
She must have been shocked.

121
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,079
Help her inside.

122
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,439
I need a quiet place to perform acupuncture.

123
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,480
Aunt Wang, help her inside.

124
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,879
Don't touch my mom with your dirty hands.

125
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,839
You've already taken Hui Ming.

126
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,959
And now you want to pretend to be a good person here?

127
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,160
How insecure are you

128
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,079
to think everyone is trying to take things from you?

129
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,040
Is it more important to argue or to save your mom?

130
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,399
Figure it out yourself.

131
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,519
Aunt Lu has already woken up.

132
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,959
But her emotions are still unstable.

133
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,360
You are her daughter.

134
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,879
Spend more time talking with her.

135
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't need you to lecture me.

136
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,480
Don't think you can act all high and mighty just because you saved my mom.

137
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,439
Miss Liu.

138
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,399
I saved her purely out of goodwill.

139
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,560
I never expected any reward.

140
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,000
No reward?

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,079
Other than what Brother Huiming bought for you,

142
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,959
is there anything on you worth showing off?

143
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Country bumpkin.

144
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,399
Now look at me.

145
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,560
The money for this dress

146
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,720
is probably more than you could earn in a lifetime.

147
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,120
What are you laughing at?

148
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,839
I'm laughing at how shallow you are.

149
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,319
Compared to the socialite I imagined,

150
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,079
you're worlds apart.

151
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,079
You—

152
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,079
That's right.

153
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,639
I come from the countryside.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,399
But I don't think there's anything shameful about it.

155
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,399
On the contrary,

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm proud that I've come this far on my own ability.

157
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,680
and I feel proud of it.

158
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,959
Who gave you the nerve to challenge me?

159
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,600
That hurts so much!

160
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,240
Lin Han!

161
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,040
How dare you hit my daughter!

162
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,199
Mom.

163
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,399
Look at her.

164
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,039
She pushed me on purpose.

165
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,279
Aunt Lu, I didn't push her.

166
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,279
She tried to hit me and fell down herself.

167
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,279
I know my own daughter.

168
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,360
I was going to thank you for helping me.

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,919
But now I see you only have medical skills and nothing else.

170
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,440
Here is your consultation fee.

171
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,519
Don't let me see you again.

172
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,080
What?

173
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,320
Not enough money?

174
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,799
Do you want me to write you a check?

175
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,480
A beggar is always a beggar.

176
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,240
I don't need your money.

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,919
But I want Liu Yinyin

178
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,960
to apologize

179
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:08,879
for what she just said to me.

180
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,159
Stop pretending.

181
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,159
Lin Han.

182
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,200
I've seen plenty of women like you.

183
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,639
Aren't you just trying to climb up?

184
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,000
Apologize.

185
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,039
In this world,

186
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,360
people like you

187
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,080
can only get charity,

188
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
never respect.

189
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,080
Yinyin, let's go.

190
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,000
I just secretly pulled out one of Grandma Lu's hairs.

191
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,480
I wanted to do a test.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,039
But now it seems

193
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,759
even if Mom is a rich heiress,

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
having a mother like this

195
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,159
wouldn't make anyone happy.

196
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,799
It's better to wait for the results

197
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,679
before telling Mom.
