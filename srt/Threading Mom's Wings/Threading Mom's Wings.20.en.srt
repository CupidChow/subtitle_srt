1
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,280
Xiaowan, where are you?

2
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400
Tell your mom to come find me alone.

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,400
Otherwise, you won't have it easy either.

4
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,120
Hello?

5
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,480
Mom, don't come looking for me.

6
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,040
Mom, go to the police.

7
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,159
Liu Yinyin has kidnapped me.

8
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:33,560
Xiaowan!

9
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,200
Xiaowan!

10
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:34,719
Lin Han.

11
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:35,920
Come find me yourself.

12
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,120
Otherwise, you'll never see your daughter again.

13
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,879
Liu Yinyin, what exactly do you want?

14
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,439
You're going against fate.

15
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,319
The price you'll pay

16
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,239
can you really accept it?

17
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,480
Is it because I came to Shanghai and changed fate

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,599
that Xiaowan ended up being kidnapped?

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,920
Driver.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,680
Driver.

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,520
A little faster, please.

22
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,719
Drive faster.

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,120
Xiaowan.

24
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,680
You must wait for Mom.

25
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,639
Nothing must happen to you.

26
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,039
Liu Yinyin.

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,159
Where is my daughter?

28
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,439
Let her go.

29
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,240
I'll do whatever you say.

30
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,240
Since you're being so obedient,

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,919
I'll give you a chance to prove yourself.

32
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,599
Leave Shanghai forever.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,960
Never appear in front of Ying Huiming again.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,199
Liu Yinyin.

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,800
He is a person.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,800
Not an object.

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,120
You can drive me away.

38
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,400
But that doesn't mean

39
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,680
he will marry you.

40
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,719
Shut up.

41
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,280
If you hadn't seduced him,

42
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,800
I would have been with him long ago.

43
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,120
We

44
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,159
We are the ones who are truly well-matched.

45
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,240
Who do you think you are?

46
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,719
Ever since I was a child,

47
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,520
anything I wanted,

48
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,400
there was nothing I couldn't get.

49
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,479
But you,

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,000
your appearance ruined everything for me.

51
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,479
You won't agree, will you?

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,840
Fine.

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,120
Xiaowan.

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,719
Lin Han.

55
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:01,879
Fine.

56
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,919
Liu Yinyin.

57
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,599
I promise you.

58
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:05,840
I promise you.

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,800
I promise you, Liu Yinyin.

60
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,680
Let my daughter go.

61
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,039
I'll agree to anything you want.

62
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,319
What a pity.

63
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,879
That was the previous demand.

64
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,759
Now

65
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,199
there's one more.

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,079
I want you

67
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,040
to crawl over here.

68
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,480
Show me your sincerity.

69
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,199
Oh no.

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
You really are as obedient as a dog.

71
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,639
But it's a pity that like this,

72
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,680
Ying Huiming won't be able to see you anymore.

73
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,160
Xiaowan.

74
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,319
Since you two are such a loving mother and daughter,

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,839
the two of you

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,360
can disappear together.

77
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,639
Just wait to rot in prison.

78
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,120
Huiming.

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,000
Hurry, go!

80
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,920
Huiming, you can't treat me like this.

81
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,480
Everything I did was because I love you.

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,079
Huiming.

83
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,600
Love?

84
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,680
Are you even worthy of talking about love?

85
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,279
Lin Han.

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
Actually, you are

87
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,199
the real eldest daughter of the Liu family.

88
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,680
But unfortunately, you have no chance now.

89
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,240
I will never

90
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,360
let you steal the life that belongs to me.

91
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,040
Yinyin.

92
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:26,920
Yinyin.

93
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,519
Yinyin.

94
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,199
Yinyin.

95
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,199
Yinyin.

96
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:43,839
Doctor

97
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,319
How is she?

98
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,360
Miss Liu has lost too much blood.

99
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,480
She is still unconscious.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,560
What?

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,920
I suggest

102
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,040
that your daughter undergo a thorough examination.

103
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,480
Although there are no external injuries,

104
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,079
her test results indicate

105
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,319
that her internal organs are showing signs of failure.

106
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,519
In her previous life, Xiaowan's body never had this problem.

107
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,519
What on earth is going on?

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,279
Wretch

109
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,199
How dare you try to kill my daughter!

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,079
I will never let you get away with this.

111
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,040
Actually, you are the real eldest daughter of the Liu family.

112
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,079
I will never

113
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,759
let you steal the life that belongs to me.

114
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,040
Aunt Lu

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,360
It wasn't me.

116
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,920
It was Liu Yinyin who pulled me.

117
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,399
And she said

118
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,199
you are—

119
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,680
Shut up!

120
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,920
At first, I didn't believe what Yinyin said.

121
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,959
People like you, who've never seen the world,

122
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,360
always just want to climb up the social ladder.

123
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,199
You should stay in the gutter forever.

124
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,279
You ill-mannered thing.

125
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,000
I think your parents

126
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,000
were all killed by your bad luck.

127
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,519
That's right.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,839
I don't have parents.

129
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,720
Even if I did,

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,279
they wouldn't care about me.

131
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,759
Lin Han

132
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,519
You're the one who did something wrong.

133
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,839
Why are you yelling at me?

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,360
Aunt Lu

135
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,639
You only ever care about your own daughter.

136
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,920
For her,

137
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,279
you can indulge her without any boundaries.

138
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,240
You twist right and wrong.

139
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,720
You even trample on other people's dignity.

140
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,959
But have you ever thought about

141
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,399
if you were my mother,

142
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,159
and your daughter was treated like this by someone else,

143
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,399
how would you feel?

144
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,840
If I were your mother,

145
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,759
I would abandon you too.

146
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,320
Because you

147
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,799
don't deserve to be loved.

148
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,360
Mom

149
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,720
Mom

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,840
Aunt Lu

151
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,519
It was Liu Yinyin who targeted Lin Han first.

152
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,159
How can you ignore right and wrong?

153
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,480
I saw it with my own eyes.

154
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,360
How could it be fake?

155
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:06,840
Huiming

156
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,240
Our Yinyin

157
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,879
what exactly did she do wrong to you?

158
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,600
You've been bewitched by that seductress.

159
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,679
But what if

160
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,159
Lin Han was your biological daughter?

161
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

162
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,120
How could she possibly be?
