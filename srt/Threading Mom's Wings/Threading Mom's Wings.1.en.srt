1
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,879
That’s the end of today’s song request program.

2
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,079
Today is September 22, 1999.

3
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,439
There are one hundred days left until the millennium.

4
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,200
You’re welcome to write in and share your thoughts about the millennium.

5
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,760
Mom.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,959
What happened?

7
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Am I dreaming?

8
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,719
I must be dreaming.

9
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,359
I must be dreaming.

10
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,719
Isn’t this my childhood home?

11
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,400
This hand...

12
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,840
Why do I have a child’s hand?

13
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:42,719
This...

14
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,280
Isn’t this what I looked like as a child?

15
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,239
What’s going on?

16
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,159
Could it be...

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,120
Could it be that I haven’t woken up from my nightmare?

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,599
Are you crazy?

19
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,359
Weren't you running a fever?

20
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,159
Why are you yelling?

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you possessed?

22
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,680
Why are you opening your mouth so wide?

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,920
Are you trying to eat someone?

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,840
The year 1999.

25
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,159
September 22nd.

26
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,439
I really came back.

27
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,680
Then my mom must still be here.

28
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,520
Damn money-loser.

29
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,879
How come you didn't burn to death?

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,879
What are you doing?

31
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,560
Are you biting people?

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,599
Stop right there, you little brat!

33
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,639
You're really making me mad.

34
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,479
I never would have thought.

35
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,960
I actually traveled back from 2025 to 1999.

36
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,879
My name is Jin Xiaowan.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,840
Deaf.

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,759
Lame leg.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,159
My boyfriend of eight years cheated on me with my best friend.

40
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,039
Tomorrow is your wedding.

41
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,520
Fang Tian is really good to you.

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,039
I'm so jealous.

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,000
I've been with Jiaojiao for a long time.

44
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,800
You just accept it.

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,599
Now you're deaf and lame.

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,680
Without me,

47
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,960
who would want you?

48
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,439
Mom

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,599
You're the only one in this world who truly loves me.

50
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,680
I really wish I could see you one more time.

51
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,879
If I could do it all over again,

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,719
How wonderful it would be if life could start over.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
This time, heaven has given me another chance.

54
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,319
I've returned to the very beginning.

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,680
I must protect the one who truly loves me.

56
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,520
Mom

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,680
Protecting you

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,479
is the only reason for my second chance at life.

59
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,719
Boss Liu

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,000
My daughter has a fever.

61
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,240
It's too late to take her to the town doctor now.

62
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,599
I've asked around.

63
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,520
Only your family has fever medicine.

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,080
A life is at stake.

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,680
Please do a good deed.

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,960
In my previous life, Mom had to borrow money for my treatment.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,159
She had no choice but to go to the village bully, Liu Sandao.

68
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,280
I have a husband and a child.

69
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,439
Let me go.

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,199
You're the one who came to me.

71
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,719
It's not up to you whether I touch you or not.

72
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,680
Because of this, she fell into the trap set by my dad and Liu Sandao.

73
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,719
It became a lifelong nightmare.

74
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,120
Liu Sandao

75
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,000
Help!

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,159
You still want medicine from me?

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
Let me be honest with you.

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,439
Your man is watching outside right now.

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,840
Lin Han

80
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,199
Take good care of Brother Liu.

81
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,000
Then my gambling debts will be wiped clean.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,919
You have to accept your fate.

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,800
Do you understand?

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,920
Just accept your fate.

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,600
That bastard

86
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:32,879
Mom

87
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,040
Wait for me

88
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,560
I will definitely save you

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,759
Xiaowan

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,040
I really saw Mom

91
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:00,480
Let's go

92
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,480
Liu Sandao

93
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,000
Go, go

94
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:06,879
Take the medicine

95
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,439
You need to take it to bring down the fever

96
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,240
What's going on?

97
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,600
Why did Liu Sandao faint?

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
Did Mom knock him out?

99
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,199
This is different from my previous life

100
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:14,800
Go

101
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,160
You little brat

102
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,480
What are you doing here?

103
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Don't bully my mom

104
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:30,680
Xiaowan

105
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,160
You've grown bold

106
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,720
How dare you ruin my plans

107
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,480
And you

108
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,319
You wretched woman

109
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,160
You're more capable than I thought, huh?

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,959
Fine

111
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,120
I'll sell both of you together

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
Don't bully my mom

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,360
Let go

114
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,519
Mom, don't worry about me, you run first

115
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:01,839
Xiaowan

116
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,040
Are you okay?

117
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:04,680
Village chief

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,480
It's right here

119
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,360
That shameless vixen from my family

120
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,800
is having an affair in this house

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Why is grandma here?

122
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,720
Xiaowan, let's go

123
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,759
Xiaowan, you go first

124
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,240
Mom

125
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,560
I have a way

126
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,560
Why isn't dad wearing any clothes?

127
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,920
He's lying together with Uncle Liu

128
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,839
What are you doing?

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,199
Why are you taking random pictures?

130
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,959
Hanliang

131
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,279
Get up

132
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,240
I said get up

133
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,439
Xiaowan, wake up.

134
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:48,959
It's time to go home.

135
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,120
Mom.

136
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,199
Why do I feel

137
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,160
so groggy?

138
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,959
Xiaowan.

139
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,199
Can you hear me?

140
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,000
You fainted on the way just now.

141
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,160
You really scared me.

142
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,360
The fever's gone down.

143
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,120
The medicine must be working.

144
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,720
Thank goodness the fever's gone.

145
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
If your ears had been damaged by the fever,

146
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,399
that would have been bad.

147
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,480
My ears...

148
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,199
Right.

149
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,600
In my previous life, my ears were damaged

150
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,800
because my fever wouldn't go down.

151
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,439
This time, Mom got medicine from Liu Sandao.

152
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,360
That means I won't go deaf again.

153
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,160
That's right.

154
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
I can change my fate.

155
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,199
Mom can too.

156
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,639
Dad is such a scumbag.

157
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,360
Mom can only be happy if she leaves him.

158
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,480
She has to leave this hellish home.

159
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,639
Only then can she truly be happy.

160
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,439
Mom.

161
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,439
Trust me.

162
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,480
There's no good life with Dad.

163
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,240
You have to seize the opportunity.

164
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,000
Divorce him.

165
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,439
I know you're doing this for my sake.

166
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,040
But if

167
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,600
we get divorced from him,

168
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,399
I don't want others to say

169
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,759
that Xiaowan is a child without a father.

170
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,360
Having a father like him is worse than having none.

171
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,040
Mom,

172
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,000
trust me.

173
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,439
As long as we leave Dad,

174
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,879
we can still live a good life.

175
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,480
It was my mistake.

176
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,000
I wanted to give you

177
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,959
a complete family.

178
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,120
Shelter from the wind

179
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:26,959
and the rain.

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
But I never expected

181
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,519
this family would become your biggest storm.

182
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,519
Alright.

183
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,080
I'll listen to you.
