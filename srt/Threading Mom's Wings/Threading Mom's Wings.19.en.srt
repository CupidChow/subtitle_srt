1
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,799
Go get the room key card.

2
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,879
Brother Huiming.

3
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,359
Be gentle, you're hurting me.

4
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,359
Isn't that Miss Liu's voice?

5
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,799
Why does it sound like she's calling Young Master Ying?

6
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,200
Young Master Ying's official girlfriend is still here.

7
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,319
Could it be...

8
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:25,519
This...

9
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:25,879
That's enough.

10
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,079
Aunt Mu.

11
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,560
No matter what kind of misunderstanding is happening inside,

12
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,760
it's not appropriate for so many people to gather here.

13
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,599
Miss Lin.

14
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,719
You must think so too, right?

15
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,400
Since it's a misunderstanding,

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
it should be cleared up in front of everyone.

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,439
Let everyone see

18
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,719
who is making such a commotion with Liu Yinyin inside.

19
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,680
Who exactly it is.

20
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,000
Huiming.

21
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:55,840
What do you think?

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
Huiming.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,959
Why are you here?

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,879
I'm not here.

25
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,480
Where did Aunt Lu think I was?

26
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,959
I wasn't feeling well just now.

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,759
I stepped out from the banquet to get some air.

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,479
Then...

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Who's inside then?

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,400
The room key card is here.

31
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:29,840
Get out.

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,479
Why is it you?

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,439
Get out.

34
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,840
Get out of here!

35
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,879
Miss Liu, how can you act like this?

36
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,639
Just now, you clearly said

37
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,120
that you couldn't control your feelings for me.

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,080
Get out!

39
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,479
What nonsense are you talking about?

40
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,960
You're just a waiter.

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,439
How could my daughter possibly like you?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Someone, come!

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,439
Take him back to the Lu family for punishment.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,360
Nobody move!

45
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,400
What's going on?

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Is this matter just going to end like this?

47
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,080
You all thought the person inside was me just now.

48
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,000
I have to give my fiancée an explanation.

49
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,400
Take him to the police station.

50
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,039
If we don't find out the truth,

51
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,039
I won't let this go.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,280
Huiming

53
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,000
You grew up together with Yinyin.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,719
You can't just stand by and watch her be humiliated.

55
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,759
If I had known it would turn out like this,

56
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,039
why did we even bother in the first place?

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,199
Let's go.

58
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,840
Xueyan

59
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,680
This is a family matter for the Liu family.

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,039
It's not appropriate for outsiders like us to interfere.

61
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,960
You should handle it yourself.

62
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,319
Grandma Mu, Huiming

63
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,439
Please listen to my explanation.

64
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,000
That's enough from you.

65
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,000
Mom

66
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,240
Mom, please help me again.

67
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,360
You stupid girl!

68
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,520
Mom

69
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,560
You actually hit me!

70
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,719
If I don't hit you,

71
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,199
you'll never come to your senses in this lifetime.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,039
You've really disappointed me.

73
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:53,960
Reflect on your actions.

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
I'll take care of things at the police station.

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,599
I'm so angry!

76
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,719
Did I drink the wrong thing?

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,719
Cheers.

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

79
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,079
I'm going to the restroom.

80
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,279
That's absolutely impossible.

81
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,120
It must be Lin Han.

82
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,480
It must be that bitch Lin Han's doing.

83
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,959
Yinyin

84
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:37,879
Yinyin

85
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,720
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm not at the point where you can come and laugh at me.

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,399
No

88
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,319
It's not like that.

89
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:44,920
Yinyin

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,399
I feel sorry for you.

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,600
Yinyin

92
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
I'm your mother.

93
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,199
What?

94
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,759
I'm your mom.

95
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,600
Alright

96
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,720
Let's eat quickly.

97
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,800
It's been a hectic day.

98
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,519
Xiaowan is almost starving.

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,199
Right?

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,879
About what happened today,

101
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
we really have to thank Xiaowan.

102
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,839
Of course.

103
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,279
I can't just watch Uncle Ying be forced into a corner.

104
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,040
Thank you.

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,439
I worked so hard to find a stepdad.

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,959
I can't let someone just take him away.

107
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,879
Uncle Ying

108
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,680
I just saw Aunt Liu acting all sneaky.

109
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
I don't know what she was saying to the waiter.

110
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,439
Aunt Lu, over these years,

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,879
has really spoiled her a bit too much.

112
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,120
Don't worry.

113
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,079
With me here, your mom will be fine.

114
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,680
Sorry, sir.

115
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,240
I really didn't mean to.

116
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,240
There's a lounge upstairs.

117
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,079
How about I have the butler take you upstairs

118
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
to use a hair dryer?

119
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,279
Mom

120
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,160
It's him.

121
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,040
It's okay.

122
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,759
You go ahead.

123
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,839
I'll wait for you here.

124
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,120
Let's go.

125
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Mom, it's him.

126
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,160
You're not even afraid of him.

127
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,639
Such petty tricks

128
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,120
aren't even worth my attention.

129
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,480
Mr. Ying

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,879
Sorry about earlier.

131
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
I got your clothes wet.

132
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,800
Let me offer this drink as an apology.

133
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,279
Thank you.

134
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,879
Take me to my room.

135
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,920
I feel like I've had a bit too much to drink.

136
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,839
Alright, alright, I'll take you.

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,639
Huiming.

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,920
Today is Grandma's big birthday.

139
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,759
Look, I bought this dress especially for today.

140
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,240
Is it pretty?

141
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:21,920
Cheers.

142
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,079
Cheers.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
This room is so hot.

144
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,439
Yinyin.

145
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,879
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

146
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,519
I'm going to the restroom.

147
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,920
Then hurry up.

148
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,519
I'll wait for you.

149
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,240
Hello?

150
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,000
Mr. Ying.

151
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,360
We've finished investigating the hotel surveillance you requested.

152
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,560
We found that your housekeeper, Qin Yue'e,

153
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,480
entered that room afterwards.

154
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,040
The two of them stayed in the room for a long time.

155
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,759
Alright, thank you for your hard work.

156
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,639
Qin Yue'e, Aunt Qin.

157
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,959
This is a photo of you when you were one month old.

158
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,680
You have a birthmark on your back.

159
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,319
Isn't that right?

160
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,920
I don't believe it.

161
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm Lu Xueyan's daughter.

162
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,159
I'm the eldest daughter of the Liu family.

163
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,720
Yin Yin.

164
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,120
It's true.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,440
Back then,

166
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,600
I wanted you to have a good life.

167
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,279
That's why I sent you to the Liu family.

168
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,080
Then why are you coming to me now?

169
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,440
What do you want?

170
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,200
Money?

171
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,440
You want money, is that it?

172
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,440
I have plenty of money.

173
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,559
As long as you stay far away from me,

174
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,799
I can give you as much as you want.

175
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,360
I...

176
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,600
I don't want money.

177
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,720
I just want you.

178
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:01,679
I don't want that.

179
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,039
Don't touch me with your filthy hands.

180
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,279
I...

181
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,840
Jin Xiaowan

182
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,919
She went to the paternity testing center.

183
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,759
She asked someone to verify the relationship between Lu Xueyan and Lin Han.

184
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,480
So what?

185
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,440
Lin Han

186
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,320
I was the one who took her.

187
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,360
After I took her,

188
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,559
I handed her over to the Lin Yuan couple, who also came here to make a living.

189
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,200
After they got the child,

190
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,799
they immediately left Shanghai.

191
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,399
No one expected

192
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,879
that after so many years, she would return here.

193
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,039
What?

194
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,759
If Lin Han comes back,

195
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,000
Lu Xueyan will definitely investigate the truth thoroughly.

196
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,200
At that time,

197
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,320
I absolutely won't allow such a thing to happen.

198
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,120
The mother and daughter

199
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,080
must disappear.

200
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,480
Miss

201
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,960
Miss, are you buying vegetables?

202
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,840
The New Year is almost here.

203
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,159
Have you prepared the dishes for New Year's Eve dinner?

204
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,759
Tell me,

205
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,679
what will happen next?

206
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,279
Can I

207
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,919
really change my fate?

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't want anything else.

209
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,039
I just want to spend more time with my daughter.

210
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,440
A little longer.

211
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,679
Everything happens for a reason.

212
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,799
I came just to tell you.

213
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,159
Hello?

214
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,799
Xiaowan's mom.

215
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,679
I wanted to ask if something happened at home.

216
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,120
Xiaowan hasn't come to school yet.

217
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,720
How is that possible?

218
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,240
She hasn't come.

219
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,639
That's impossible.

220
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,919
I clearly saw her enter the school myself.

221
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,480
Hello?

222
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,559
Hello?

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,879
This is Liu Yinyin.

224
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,799
Mom.

225
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,000
It's me, Xiaowan.

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,279
Xiaowan.

227
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:02,519
Mom.

228
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,399
Xiaowan.

229
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:03,919
Xiaowan.

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,480
Xiaowan.

231
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,480
Small troubles might be avoided.

232
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,840
But when big things happen, there's no way to escape.

233
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,519
The price you pay for going against fate—

234
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,840
can you really accept it?
