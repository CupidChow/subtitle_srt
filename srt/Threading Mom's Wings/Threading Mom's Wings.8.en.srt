00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,319
Dear friends and neighbors,

2
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,879
the Xiangshui Town Fashion Week

3
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,840
officially begins now.

4
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,000
From the year 2020,

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400
the Jinling Family's bubble air vest

6
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,480
highlights a decadent, free-spirited, and relaxed vibe.

7
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,519
A snakeskin belt paired with woven patterns

8
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,159
is inspired by the moving style seen at train stations.

9
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,840
It captures the spontaneous travel spirit of modern people during the Spring Festival rush.

10
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,599
These jewel-encrusted shorts

11
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,959
perfectly embody

12
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,439
the "wearing it is like not wearing it" useless style.

13
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,599
Underwear as outerwear—

14
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,799
believe me, one day in the future,

15
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,040
this will definitely take the world by storm.

16
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,599
Galaxy silk camisoles and fitted dresses

17
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,560
are like walking vessels of culture.

18
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,360
Uncle Ying, my mom designed all of these.

19
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,840
Jinlin is so lucky to have my mom—she's a real treasure.

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,000
Everyone,

21
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,639
do you want to change yourself?

22
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,400
Do you want to find the most beautiful version of yourself?

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,639
No matter your height, weight, skin color, or looks,

24
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,719
there's a future here just for you.

25
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,479
Uncle Ying, my mom is the special guest.

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,840
She's about to make her grand entrance.

27
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,680
Su Mingyue bullies my mom like this

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,240
This is the year 2000

29
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,159
A new form of livestream selling

30
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,680
I'll show you something new

31
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,560
Thank you all for attending Jinlin's first fashion show

32
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,120
All the outfits from today's show

33
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,840
are available to order now

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,319
The outfit the third model just wore

35
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,120
I'll take one, please

36
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,080
And also

37
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,639
The last outfit you wore was great too

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,280
I want that one as well

39
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,039
Of course, no problem

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,199
But our clothes are custom-made to order

41
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,960
So there's a seven-day pre-sale

42
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,080
You can register with the manager in a bit

43
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,039
Pre-sale?

44
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Who knows if you'll just take the money and run

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,199
Everyone might as well come to my place

46
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,280
At least I sell genuine factory goods

47
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,719
Anyone who comes today gets a discount

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,840
Is that for real?

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
Pretty lady

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,879
Too many people wear the clothes this lady sells

51
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,599
With your style

52
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,159
It's clear you don't care about the price

53
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,520
And you probably don't like wearing the same as others

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
Now that the new store is open

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
If you bring in three new customers

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,120
you can shorten the production time by three days

57
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,079
Bring five and the cost is halved

58
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,399
That's right

59
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,279
How about this

60
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,879
I'll give you today's outfit for free

61
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,480
Everyone who makes a purchase

62
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,920
will get styling suggestions

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,680
All you have to do is become more beautiful

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,519
Your clothes are so trendy, they must be pretty expensive.

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,319
How much are they?

66
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,439
How much does this outfit sell for in the city?

67
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,160
168.

68
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,839
Today, it's not 168.

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,160
98.

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Not even 98.

71
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,319
If we sell it like this,

72
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,600
we'll definitely lose money.

73
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,839
Mom doesn't care anymore.

74
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,680
Just listen to me.

75
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,199
Today it's only 68.

76
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,720
Take home a whole set of new clothes.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,040
There are extra benefits if you bring a friend.

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
If it's this cheap, I'll take both sets.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,040
I'll go get my friends to come buy with me right now.

80
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,519
Okay.

81
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,319
Lin Han

82
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,399
Don't think you're so great just because someone has your back.

83
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,079
We'll see about that.

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,000
Mom

85
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,600
The things that belong to you

86
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,279
I'll make sure they give them all back to you, little by little.

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,160
It's all booked.

88
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,079
Xiaowan

89
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,720
It's really all booked.

90
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,360
Mom

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720
What did I tell you?

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,399
Once my mom steps in,

93
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,399
we get mountains of gold and silver.

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,439
You've got a lot of ideas in that little head of yours.

95
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,759
You've never even left Xiangshui Town.

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,720
Where do you get all these creative ideas?

97
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,120
Where did they come from?

98
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
Of course, it's from seeing a lot in life.

99
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
But I can't say that out loud.

100
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,759
That's called talent.

101
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,000
My precious Lin Han

102
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,319
can succeed at anything.

103
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,879
Go ahead,

104
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,519
what gift do you want?

105
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,800
A Barbie doll.

106
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,639
New clothes.

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,160
I'll buy them all for you.

108
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,399
Can I have everything I like?

109
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,439
Of course.

110
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,199
I want to buy stocks.

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,160
And a house.

112
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
I want to buy gold.

113
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:38,480
Mom

114
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,000
You have to seize the opportunity to become a rich woman.

115
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,879
How can I help Mom seize this opportunity?

116
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,439
So she can become rich sooner.

117
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,040
It seems the path to becoming a carefree rich second generation

118
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,680
is still quite difficult.

119
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
Little Immortal

120
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,959
Little Immortal

121
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,959
Xiaowan, Little Immortal

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,800
Little Immortal

123
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,600
If only my mom were as easy to please as him.

124
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,000
Little Immortal

125
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,000
Look,

126
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,319
that He Banxian

127
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,319
just touched me twice and knew my last name, just like you.

128
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,439
It's amazing.

129
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,360
He said

130
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,600
I'll definitely face a misfortune this year.

131
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,279
I need to spend money to ward off disaster.

132
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:29,800
How about

133
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,639
you come with me to check it out?

134
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,240
Warding off disaster is fine,

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,240
but spending money, forget it.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,160
Let's go.

137
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,720
Your body is too weak.

138
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,800
You've attracted something.

139
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:50,920
What should I do then?

140
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,639
Quickly take this pill.

141
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,000
I guarantee you'll be cured right away.

142
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,759
Brother Da

143
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,079
You really do have misfortune.

144
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,959
The swindler in front of you is a huge disaster.

145
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,800
What do you mean by that?

146
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,519
You little brat.

147
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,279
What are you talking about?

148
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,079
Go away, go away.

149
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,000
Stop making trouble here.

150
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,519
Brother Da, let me tell you,

151
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,600
Don’t regret it later.

152
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,000
If you get sick or have bad luck,

153
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,959
don’t come looking for me.

154
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,199
A swindler dares to be so loud.

155
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
Watch me teach you a lesson.

156
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,800
Isn’t your only trick guessing people’s surnames?

157
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,000
I can do that too.

158
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,399
If you can do it,

159
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,240
I’ll twist my head off and let you use it as a ball.

160
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:32,720
Alright.

161
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,960
It’s a deal.

162
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,200
The little fortune-teller is amazing!

163
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,080
Zhao.

164
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,159
Qian.

165
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,639
Sun.

166
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,039
Li.

167
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,600
Zhou.

168
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,559
Wu.

169
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,720
A gentleman's word is his bond.

170
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,200
When do you plan to twist your head off

171
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
and let me use it as a ball?

172
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,879
Go on, say it.

173
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,320
When exactly?

174
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,080
What do you mean?

175
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,240
You—you—what do you mean, you?

176
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,919
This isn't any kind of magic at all.

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,559
This is just a math formula.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,679
What's going on?

179
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,960
Those pills you gave me—

180
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,600
why did I start coughing and couldn't breathe after taking them?

181
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,279
You can't blame me for this.

182
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,759
Where are you going?

183
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,159
It's all because this little girl offended the gods.

184
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,200
Now the retribution has fallen on your son.

185
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:21,919
What's wrong?

186
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,240
Please, check on him quickly.

187
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,279
Miss, what method are you using?

188
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,200
Will it work?

189
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,960
It will definitely work.

190
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,039
Son,

191
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,200
are you feeling better?

192
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:39,840
Son,

193
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,559
he should be fine now.

194
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,200
How dare you lie to me!

195
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,000
You can't even tell the difference between suffocation and possession.

196
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,679
Stop pretending to be mystical here.

197
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,440
Miss, thank you.

198
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,480
It's all thanks to you.

199
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,720
You are my son's savior.

200
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,639
Because I am a mother too,

201
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,080
I can understand you.

202
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,519
I studied medicine

203
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,759
so I wouldn't have any regrets.

204
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,039
I hereby announce

205
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,320
that Lin Han, in just one day,

206
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,960
sold all the unsold clothes in our factory.

207
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,919
She set a new trend for the whole town.

208
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,320
This order meeting

209
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,799
brought our factory a profit of 300,000.

210
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,879
About yesterday's act of bravery,

211
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,840
I've heard about it too.

212
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,159
This time, the outstanding individual

213
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,399
can only be you.

214
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,279
Thank you, Consultant Ying.

215
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:46,960
Come.

216
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,240
Alright.

217
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,200
The new factory director's assistant

218
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,120
will be Lin Han from now on.

219
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,960
Her direct supervisor

220
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,200
is

221
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,559
this wretched woman.

222
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,519
Today,

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,519
I must have an explanation.
