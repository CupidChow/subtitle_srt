1
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,520
Uncle Ying

2
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,960
Starting today

3
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm entrusting Mom to you

4
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:09,480
Mom

5
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,159
You used to live your whole life for me

6
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,760
Now

7
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,719
I want you to live freely for once

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,840
Go pursue

9
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,519
your own happiness

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,239
Mom

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,120
Go ahead

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,359
My name is Ying Huiming.

13
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
I'm twenty-nine years old this year.

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,239
I'm single.

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,359
In this lifetime,

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,640
I've only ever liked one person.

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
We started communicating eight years ago.

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,799
Unfortunately, after a year,

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,719
we lost contact.

20
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,879
We were both too young back then.

21
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,359
Too reserved.

22
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,159
We always thought there was plenty of time.

23
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,560
That we could get to know each other slowly.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,640
But

25
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,319
life is always full of unexpected events.

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,479
After our only means of contact was lost,

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,719
I realized

28
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,599
that I knew nothing about your real life.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,360
I hadn't even asked your most basic information, like your name.

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,039
Without letters,

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,680
we disappeared into the vast crowd.

32
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,240
There was no way to find you again.

33
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,680
Back then,

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,199
I regretted it every day.

35
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,719
That I didn't tell you how I felt sooner.

36
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,560
Lin Han,

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,159
I like you.

38
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,039
It's not a sudden feeling.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
During those years we lost contact,

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,759
I never thought I would see you again.

41
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,360
But fate was kind,

42
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,000
and we met again.

43
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,240
Lin Han, I am Li Ming.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,240
I know you have a lot of concerns.

45
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,240
But I have just one thing to say.

46
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,479
Don't worry.

47
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,439
You brat.

48
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,960
Stop saying so much nonsense.

49
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,960
Hurry up and take out what you prepared.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,280
Quick.

51
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,439
Hurry up.

52
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,159
From today on,

53
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,759
my property deed,

54
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,800
my savings,

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
and all the companies under my name

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
will all be entrusted to you.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
For the rest of my life,

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,639
my savings,

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,159
you will have the final say.

60
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,599
Loving someone is like tending flowers.

61
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,560
I promise

62
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,199
I will make sure that every day for you and Xiao Wan

63
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,439
is more beautiful than flowers.

64
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,240
Is that okay?

65
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,080
Okay.

66
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:22,720
Lin Han.

67
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,000
Will you marry me?

68
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,279
Marry him.

69
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,000
I will.

70
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,000
The flowers are gone.

71
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,519
I'm happy now.

72
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,920
Mom.

73
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,319
I did it.

74
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,160
In this lifetime,

75
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,199
I can finally make you happy.

76
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,399
Xiao Wan.

77
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:25,959
Xiao Wan.

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,839
Little girl

79
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,639
Do you want to buy something?

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,720
If you could do it all over again

81
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,279
What kind of regret would you want to make up for?

82
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:01,399
Yes

83
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,800
I want to buy my mom's survival

84
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Everything in the world has its price

85
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,680
The weight of life and death

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,720
cannot be measured by money

87
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,519
Who are you, really?

88
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,800
You are the one who let me be reborn

89
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
and gave me this chance

90
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,920
Since you gave me this chance

91
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,439
why can't life and death be changed?

92
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,879
What do I have to do to save my mom?

93
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,040
The laws of the universe are about balance

94
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,920
Xiaowan

95
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,199
The past cannot be changed

96
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,639
If it's about balance

97
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,160
as long as I take my mom's place

98
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,639
my mom can survive

99
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
just like how my lame leg was transferred to my dad

100
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,759
Isn't that right?

101
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,319
Who can say for sure what will happen in the future?

102
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
But remember

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,160
every choice comes with a price

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,800
Da-ge

105
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,879
Take me back to Xiangshui Town

106
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,399
Let's go

107
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
On this night in my previous life

108
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,120
Mom had her accident on the main street of Xiangshui Town

109
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,199
Now Mom is held up by a marriage proposal

110
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,959
As long as I get to the scene before the accident happens

111
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,600
I can take her place

112
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,560
I'm sorry, Huiming.

113
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:41,759
I...

114
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,959
I can't say yes to you.

115
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,920
If tomorrow

116
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,600
If I can still appear before you tomorrow,

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,079
I'll propose to you again.

118
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:57,759
Han, girl.

119
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,079
Han, girl...

120
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,000
Han, girl.

121
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,759
Han, girl.

122
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,920
Han, girl.

123
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,519
Da-ge.

124
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,319
Aren't we going back to Xiangshui Town?

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,680
Why aren't we there yet?

126
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,120
No.

127
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,639
This isn't the way to the train station.

128
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,240
Stop the car, I want to get out.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,360
Let me out.

130
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,639
Xiaowan.

131
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,639
This is all for your own good.

132
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,799
Lin Han

133
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,440
Lin Han

134
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,120
Da Ge

135
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,799
What's wrong?

136
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,600
I haven't been able to reach Xiaowan these past two days.

137
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm really worried.

138
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,080
How is she?

139
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,799
She's fine.

140
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,559
Is something wrong?

141
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,240
She didn't tell you?

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,120
Your ex-husband Jin Hanliang

143
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,000
has died.

144
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,559
It happened just last week.

145
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,639
On the 15th.

146
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,519
Hello?

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,559
Lin Han

148
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,200
I shouldn't have said that.

149
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,320
My brother's funeral is this week.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,399
You should bring Xiaowan over.

151
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,279
No matter what,

152
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,519
he's still her father.

153
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,840
Lin Han

154
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,559
Don't be too upset.

155
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,559
That scumbag is gone, and that's that.

156
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,559
He's not worth it.

157
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,120
It's all in the past.

158
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:34,879
Da Ge

159
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,759
I want to ask you for a favor.

160
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,200
Can you help me with something?

161
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:49,960
Lin Han

162
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,919
Lin Han

163
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,919
Huiming, I—

164
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,240
Please listen to me first.

165
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,799
Xiaowan told me

166
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,480
there's no time left.

167
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,720
I don't know why there's no time left either.

168
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,399
All kinds of possibilities ran through my mind.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,159
But I still couldn't figure it out.

170
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
So I have to ask you.

171
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,840
Never mind, I won't ask.

172
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,480
None of that matters anyway.

173
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,960
What matters most is

174
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,279
what exactly I should do.

175
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,000
What should I do?

176
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,480
Huiming

177
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,879
You've already done so much for me.

178
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,240
Heaven has given me a second chance.

179
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,879
Letting us

180
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,600
meet again.

181
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,919
I already feel incredibly happy.

182
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,039
But this happiness is like Cinderella's pumpkin carriage.

183
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
When midnight comes,

184
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,879
will I turn back to what I was?

185
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,519
Or maybe I still

186
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,360
won't be able to stand in front of you.

187
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,720
Heaven let us, who lost contact for so many years,

188
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
meet again.

189
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,200
That means fate is watching over us.

190
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,039
That's exactly why I'm even more afraid.

191
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm afraid

192
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,440
this extra happiness I've gained

193
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,799
will make me pay

194
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,919
an irreversible price.

195
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,879
Huiming

196
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,279
I have

197
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,120
someone I must protect.

198
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,159
So I

199
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,120
I have to go.

200
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,399
I've prepared the plane ticket you wanted.

201
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,360
I believe

202
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,240
you will definitely come back.

203
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,879
I'll wait for you to return.

204
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
Propose to me.

205
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,960
Mom

206
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,840
You are in this world

207
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,320
the most qualified mother

208
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,919
and also the best mother

209
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:03,960
So

210
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,039
if there is a next life

211
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,360
would Xiaowan still choose me to be her mother?

212
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,240
No

213
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,080
Because if there is another life

214
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,080
I would want Mom to be my daughter

215
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,919
I want to take good care of Mom

216
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,600
Lin Han

217
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,159
I like you

218
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,120
From now on, for the rest of my life

219
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,440
my savings

220
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,080
you get to decide everything

221
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,720
I promise

222
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,960
I will make sure that every day for you and Xiaowan

223
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,000
is more beautiful than flowers

224
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,120
You still have a chance to change your mind

225
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:57,840
Mom

226
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,399
I want you to live freely for once

227
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,200
to pursue

228
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,840
your own happiness

229
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,080
No

230
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,759
Take me to walk the path I was meant to

231
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,879
the path I was supposed to take

232
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,240
Mom

233
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,559
Mom

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,679
Mom

235
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:45,879
Mom

236
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,639
Mom

237
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,720
Mom, where are you?

238
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,039
Xiaowan

239
00:14:59,279 --> 00:14:59,840
Mom

240
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,639
Mom

241
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:16,879
Xiaowan

242
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,240
You're awake

243
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,360
Uncle Ying, where's my mom?

244
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,080
There's no time, take me to her quickly!

245
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,759
Xiaowan.

246
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,360
Your mom...

247
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,279
She went back to Xiangshui Town.

248
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,440
She'll be back soon.

249
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,240
Xiangshui Town?

250
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:37,759
Why?

251
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,120
Xiaowan.

252
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,320
You clearly promised me.

253
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,559
Why won't you help me?

254
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,840
Why?

255
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,480
Xiaowan.

256
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,799
This is your mother's wish.

257
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,840
This is the key your mother left for you.

258
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,759
There's a rosewood box inside.

259
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,840
It contains things she left for you.

260
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,279
We're here.

261
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,879
If you could live again,

262
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,240
would you change your fate of dying?

263
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,039
My name is Lin Han.

264
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,640
I'm a woman who has lived twice.

265
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,680
This is my second life.

266
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,279
My daughter's name is Jin Xiaowan.

267
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,599
I know she was reborn.

268
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,599
But that doesn't matter.

269
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,119
She will always be my daughter.

270
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,759
I must make sure she is born.
