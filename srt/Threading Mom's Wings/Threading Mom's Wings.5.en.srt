1
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,120
I heard a charlatan has come to the village.

2
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,159
That must be you, right?

3
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,319
You say I'm an evil spirit.

4
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,719
What proof do you have?

5
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,959
Look at the girl's mouth.

6
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:13,439
Go on, say it.

7
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,359
Calm down.

8
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,000
Evidence?

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,599
Of course I have it.

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,640
Petty tricks.

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,159
Burn this talisman.

12
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,480
We'll see right away if you're human or a ghost.

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Fraud.

14
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
If you're a liar, your whole family will die.

15
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,200
I'll make you reveal everything.

16
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,480
First, use soapy water to erase what Grandma wrote.

17
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,480
Then do the same thing again.

18
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,560
Let's turn her old hen into a duck.

19
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,280
That's brilliant.

20
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,280
What should I write?

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,920
Got it.

22
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,439
Old Taoist.

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,840
Your talisman even has anti-fraud features?

24
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,439
It really is a magical talisman.

25
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,080
It can even protect you from yourself.

26
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,240
Wha-what's going on here?

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,400
Why is it different from what you said?

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,560
I don't know either.

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,360
Honestly, I'm scared too.

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,319
You think you can fool me with such petty tricks?

31
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,479
I'm a college student in the new era, after all.

32
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,400
I didn't study chemistry for nothing.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,919
You evil spirit,

34
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,000
you can even interfere with talismans.

35
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,000
Your demonic power must be strong.

36
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,759
Why are you all just standing there?

37
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,520
Hurry up and take her to the village entrance.

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,240
I'll start the ritual right away.

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,159
I'll subdue her.

40
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,439
Tie her up.

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,520
I miscalculated.

42
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,479
I originally wanted to teach Grandma a lesson.

43
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,960
I never expected Grandma to be this ruthless.

44
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,520
Mom went shopping and hasn't come back yet.

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,800
Evil spirit.

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,199
I'll ask you one more time.

47
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,039
Are you willing to kneel and admit your mistake now?

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,919
Come out obediently.

49
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,840
I did nothing wrong.

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,479
Isn't she still perfectly fine?

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,879
You want me to kneel?

52
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,560
Keep dreaming.

53
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,360
Stubborn and unrepentant.

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,759
Fellow villagers,

55
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,199
Tonight, I'll show you something new.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,280
Witness real Taoist magic.

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,199
My grandma really is out of her mind.

58
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,960
She actually came up with such a vicious plan.

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,879
To deal with me and Mom.

60
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,520
Luckily, Mom isn't here.

61
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,919
Otherwise, who knows what she'd do to Mom.

62
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,280
But now I'm trapped in a child's body.

63
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,280
If she wants to hurt me,

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,960
I'm afraid I wouldn't even be able to resist.

65
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,599
If something happens to me,

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,319
what will Mom do?

67
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:11,680
No, this can't happen.

68
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,360
I have to find a way.

69
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,319
Wicked child.

70
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,720
Leave at once!

71
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,519
Let's see what tricks you have.

72
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,759
Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless.

73
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,639
Watch as I use this bowl of black dog blood.

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,759
It will reveal your true form.

75
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,279
Stop!

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,240
Nonsense!

77
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,000
If you dare touch my daughter,

78
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,959
just try it.

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,199
Xiaowan, don't be afraid.

80
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:34,399
Mom.

81
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,279
Mom is here.

82
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,120
You've been blinded by family ties.

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,720
But as a seasoned Taoist,

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,639
I have sharp, discerning eyes.

85
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,319
This girl is already possessed by an evil spirit.

86
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,279
Watch as I exorcise it.

87
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:48,959
Freeze!

88
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,560
I think the real evil spirit here is you.

89
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:56,720
Water.

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,040
Come.

91
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:02,600
Reveal.

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,759
A ghost!

93
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,240
It's appeared!

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,720
Rise.

95
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,560
Why is it flying?

96
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,759
You falsely claimed to be protected by immortals.

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,639
And bullied me, the true chosen one.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,439
That's why you attracted evil spirits.

99
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,480
I'm warning you.

100
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,319
If you don't tell the truth now,

101
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,879
I'll scatter the ashes of my talisman burned with true fire,

102
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,600
and you'll surely die.

103
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,079
I was wrong.

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,000
I was wrong, I was wrong.

105
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,879
I'm not a master.

106
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,439
I'm just a fraud.

107
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,240
I'm just a con artist.

108
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,720
I'm a fraud.

109
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
Fraud, fraud, fraud.

110
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Fraud, fraud, fraud.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,600
The true chosen girl.

112
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,120
Chosen one, please save me.

113
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,839
Just a little palace trickery

114
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,680
was enough to fool you.

115
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,720
Looks like your master didn't teach you well.

116
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,639
Everyone,

117
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,319
you all heard what was just said.

118
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,399
This person is clearly a fraud.

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,560
Are you messing with me?

120
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,879
Grandma

121
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,399
Even at a time like this

122
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,319
you're still not telling the truth?

123
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,319
My eldest granddaughter

124
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,480
Grandma always tells the truth, doesn't she?

125
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,000
So Grandma was tricked too, right?

126
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,920
Grandma will beat him up for you

127
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,279
You big liar

128
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,439
How dare you lie to me

129
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,120
I'll hit you

130
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,439
I'll teach you for lying

131
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,319
Don't hit, don't hit

132
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll teach you for lying

133
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
You liar

134
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,600
My eldest granddaughter

135
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,319
See, I hit him for you

136
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:57,959
Grandma

137
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,040
If you really have a clear conscience

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,759
then swear an oath

139
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,199
If you deliberately set up me and my mom

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,439
then may you be struck by lightning

141
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,240
Swear it

142
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:13,920
Swear

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,639
Swear

144
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,399
Swear

145
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,519
Swear

146
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,160
Swear

147
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,079
Swear

148
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:18,959
Swear

149
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,560
Eldest granddaughter

150
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,920
Look at what kind of oath you're making Grandma swear

151
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,519
Grandma is always so good to you and your mom

152
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,120
Swear

153
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,759
Swear

154
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,720
Swear

155
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,360
Alright, alright, alright

156
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,360
I swear

157
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,199
I swear

158
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,959
I swear

159
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
I swear

160
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:35,959
I sw—

161
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,800
Swear

162
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,480
I, Miao Cuihua, swear

163
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,600
I, Miao Cuihua, swear here

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,800
If I have ever framed the mother and daughter

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,800
May I be struck by lightning

166
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,000
Get out, now! Go, go, go!

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,360
You two troublemakers, get out!

168
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,440
Son,

169
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,720
if they don't leave soon,

170
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,519
your mom won't survive.

171
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,279
Enough.

172
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,480
No need to kick us out.

173
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,159
Just sign the papers.

174
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,440
We'll leave right away.

175
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,200
Fine.

176
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,080
I'll sign.

177
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Don't say I didn't warn you.

178
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,399
Once you leave me,

179
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
you won't have a good life.

180
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,759
In the future,

181
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,759
you'll come begging me.

182
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,840
Mom, let's go inside and take a photo.

183
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,200
Okay.

184
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,639
Come on.

185
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,639
Ready.

186
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,320
Three, two, one.

187
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,279
Cheese!

188
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,679
Mom,

189
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,279
The call to make money has sounded.

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,559
Cheese!

191
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,440
