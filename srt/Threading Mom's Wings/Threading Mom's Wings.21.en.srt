1
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,799
What if

2
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,400
Lin Han is actually your biological daughter?

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,959
What nonsense are you talking about?

4
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,519
How could she possibly be?

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,560
This is a paternity test that Xiaowan did using your hair.

6
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,040
Lin Han

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,239
is your real daughter.

8
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,159
No.

9
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
How is that possible?

10
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,959
You must be lying to me.

11
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,239
My child has been missing for so many years.

12
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,480
How could she possibly come back?

13
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,480
It's even less likely to be her.

14
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,760
This report

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,359
You must have faked it.

16
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,799
I want to retest.

17
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,280
Don't worry, dear.

18
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,960
As long as I'm here,

19
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,120
no one can take away

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
your place in the Liu family.

21
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Don't be in such a hurry to leave.

22
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,199
That sample is fake.

23
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,800
Sister Qin.

24
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,759
What are you doing in the sample room?

25
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,439
Why did you steal Lin Han's sample?

26
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,039
Speak.

27
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,719
What exactly is going on here?

28
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,039
I...

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,479
Aunt Lu.

30
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,039
I...

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,319
Back then, she gave birth at the same time as you.

32
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,800
Because her family was poor,

33
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,520
right after her confinement period,

34
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,840
she started working at a hotel.

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,319
She saw you holding a lavish banquet

36
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,719
to celebrate your baby's first month.

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,240
It was a grand affair.

38
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,639
She saw that Lin Han was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.

39
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
She became jealous.

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,560
As for the couple,

41
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,560
they wanted their own child to have a good life.

42
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,840
So she had her husband steal Lin Han.

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,280
And they casually gave the child to a passing coworker of Lin Yuan.

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,159
But you always mistakenly thought it was a business rival seeking revenge.

45
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,039
That's why you've searched for years without success.

46
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,919
Meanwhile,

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,360
they disguised their daughter as an abandoned baby

48
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,280
and left her at the Liu family's doorstep,

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,399
to replace the real heiress, Lin Han, who was lost.

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,199
This was how they took over your family.

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,399
Child,

52
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,040
don't blame Mom.

53
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,879
Mom did it for your own good.

54
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,000
All these years

55
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,720
you've been trying to get close to your daughter.

56
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
After several failed attempts to enter the Liu family,

57
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,439
you tried everything you could.

58
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,399
You ended up working as a maid for the Ying family, who have close ties with the Lius.

59
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,839
You really had it all planned out.

60
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:30,879
Why?

61
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,680
Why did you do all this?

62
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,720
Why?

63
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,279
Because I don't believe in fate.

64
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,240
Why is it that your rich kids

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,160
are born into privilege,

66
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,839
while my daughter has to suffer with me?

67
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,240
See?

68
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,120
Fate can be changed.

69
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,879
My daughter

70
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,959
can also become a rich young lady.

71
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,279
That's enough.

72
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,720
Save that talk for the police.

73
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,519
Lin Han,

74
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,680
I'll be waiting for you outside.

75
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,519
Call me if you need anything.

76
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,600
Sweetie

77
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,240
My daughter

78
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,279
It's Mom who has let you down

79
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,639
Tomorrow

80
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,560
Tomorrow I'll have someone register your household

81
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,759
We'll change your surname back

82
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,639
If your dad knew about this

83
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,920
he would definitely be happy

84
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,120
Change the surname

85
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,360
Then what do you think I should be called?

86
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,879
Liu Yinyin

87
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,600
Sweetie

88
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,720
The one who did wrong was Qin Yue'e

89
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,879
But Yinyin is also a victim

90
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,000
She was just a child back then

91
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,079
In this matter

92
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,800
She is innocent too

93
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,639
Don't worry

94
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,000
What you've lost

95
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,759
Mom will definitely make it up to you

96
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,519
My mom doesn't need your compensation

97
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,560
Liu Yinyin has hurt my mom so many times

98
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,480
Grandma Lu, you still want to protect her

99
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,839
You don't deserve to be my mom's mother at all

100
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,439
Xiaowan

101
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,480
How can you talk like that?

102
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,120
I know

103
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,240
You all resent what I did before

104
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,279
Lin Han

105
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,079
I have money

106
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,920
I can give Xiaowan the best education

107
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,959
The best education

108
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,199
can't be bought with money

109
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,279
In my heart

110
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,879
My Xiaowan is the best

111
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
I used to think

112
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,439
that as a mother

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
I had to give everything I had

114
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,279
to pave the way for my daughter

115
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,399
and provide her with resources

116
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,639
In this regard

117
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,680
I truly didn't do well enough as a mother

118
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,879
I couldn't give Xiaowan

119
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,959
a carefree

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,879
and prosperous life

121
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,120
Mom

122
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,120
But after seeing you, I finally understood

123
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,480
By comparison

124
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,559
what's even more important is

125
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,960
to help her understand

126
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,480
how to face her own life

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,080
how to become

128
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,919
a kind-hearted

129
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,159
and independent person

130
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,519
At least in this aspect

131
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,159
I feel

132
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,159
I did a pretty good job as a mother

133
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I accept your apology

134
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,960
Because as a mother

135
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,799
I really understand how you feel

136
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,200
You gave me life

137
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,919
and I am truly grateful for that

138
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,559
Goodbye

139
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,320
Aunt Lu

140
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,480
I've seen plenty of women like you.

141
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,039
Aren't you just trying to climb up the social ladder?

142
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,600
In this world,

143
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,679
people like you can only get charity.

144
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,200
There's no respect for you.

145
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,240
You people who have never seen the world,

146
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,679
who only want to latch onto someone powerful,

147
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,440
should stay in the gutter forever.

148
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,799
You're so uncultured.

149
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,200
I think your parents

150
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,279
were probably killed by your bad luck.

151
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:18,720
That's right.

152
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,600
I don't have parents.

153
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,200
Even if I did,

154
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,039
they wouldn't care about me.

155
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,399
Sit.

156
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,000
Mom.

157
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,080
You are the world's

158
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,720
most qualified mother.

159
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,200
And the best mother too.

160
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,440
Then,

161
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,519
if there's a next life,

162
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,840
would Xiaowan still choose me as her mother?

163
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:55,639
No.

164
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,480
Because if there's another life,

165
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,879
I'll make Mom my daughter.

166
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,679
I want to take good care of Mom.
