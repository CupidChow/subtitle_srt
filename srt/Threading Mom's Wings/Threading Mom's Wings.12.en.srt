1
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,759
If you and your lover are really innocent,

2
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,640
then how do you explain

3
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,200
that you kept a cheap pen he gave you for so many years?

4
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,239
This pen

5
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:16,879
This pen

6
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,040
is

7
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,200
Lin Han

8
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,439
I am Li Ming.

9
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,239
Everyone, look over here!

10
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,879
She admitted it herself.

11
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,120
Those two have been having an affair for a long time.

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,599
It's really disgusting, I'm telling you.

13
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,480
You, today...

14
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,799
You have no shame.

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,079
You've brought great disgrace to our Jin family.

16
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,079
As long as I'm alive today,

17
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,400
you can forget about leaving this house.

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,959
What are you all arguing about?

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,879
What's all this noise?

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,359
Everyone, disperse! Go away!

21
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,760
You even dare to offend the factory director.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,799
Our village's cotton still depends on him.

23
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,599
Director.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,400
So the director can steal someone else's wife?

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
The director can meddle in other people's family affairs?

26
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,040
Isn't that right?

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,639
She's not your wife anymore.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
From now on, her business is my business.

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,199
We'll see about that.

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,000
Come back here!

31
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,240
Lin Han!

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,240
Don't you want to know where your daughter is now?

33
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,719
If you leave with him,

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,400
I'll make sure you never see that brat again.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,479
Jin Hanliang!

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,479
Jin Hanliang!

37
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,400
Are you crazy?

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,439
She's your daughter!

39
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,319
You'd even do that to your own daughter?

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,039
Ouch!

41
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,120
He's hitting people!

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,400
What are you doing?

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,479
Come home and live with me.

44
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,439
Lin Han, go to the warehouse.

45
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,719
Xiaowan must be there.

46
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,360
Let's go.

47
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,479
Xiaowan

48
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:48,960
Xiaowan

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,759
Xiaowan, are you in there?

50
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,400
Xiaowan

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,840
Xiaowan

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,599
Xiaowan

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,039
Xiaowan

54
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,080
Xiaowan

55
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:05,960
Xiaowan

56
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,360
Xiaowan

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,280
Xiaowan, wake up! Xiaowan!

58
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,599
Xiaowan

59
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,879
Xiaowan, wake up! Xiaowan!

60
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,360
What's that smell?

61
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,479
It must be gas.

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,120
Gas?

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,280
November 11th

64
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,000
It was today in my previous life, too.

65
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,759
Xiaolin, go check it out quickly.

66
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,879
Hanliang drank too much.

67
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,159
He dropped a cigarette on the bed and burned your house down.

68
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,039
Your daughter

69
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,479
I told you to come over.

70
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,599
I'm telling you,

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,479
she was sleeping so deeply herself.

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,080
She didn't even know when the fire started.

73
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,199
And now I have to spend money to get her treated.

74
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,560
I don't want to talk to you right now.

75
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:52,879
Lin Han

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,039
Stupid woman

77
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,120
Mom

78
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,199
Xiaowan is back.

79
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,840
All my classmates at school say

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm ugly.

81
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,199
Nonsense.

82
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,919
Our Xiaowan

83
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
is the kindest and cutest little darling.

84
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,160
Mom

85
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
They also laugh at me and call me a little cripple.

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,519
Xiaowan

87
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,519
Xiaowan

88
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,399
Xiaowan

89
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,439
Xiaowan, don't be afraid.

90
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,560
Mom is here to save you.

91
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:43,680
Xiaowan

92
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,920
Xiaowan

93
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,000
Xiaowan

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,399
Xiaowan

95
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:49,879
No

96
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,120
I've clearly avoided so many things.

97
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,600
You need to eat this to bring your fever down.

98
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,680
Why

99
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,319
Why

100
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
I still can't change Xiaowan's fate.

101
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,600
Xiaowan

102
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,199
Mom will definitely get you out.

103
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
Mom will never let your leg get hurt again.

104
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,000
Su Mingyue

105
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,480
What are you going to do?

106
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,319
Lin Han

107
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,399
This is all your retribution.

108
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,360
Su Mingyue

109
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,240
Xiaowan

110
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,759
You're crazy.

111
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,439
Xiaowan

112
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,759
Mom

113
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,240
Lin Han

114
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,959
This is your retribution.

115
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,560
Don't worry, Miss Lin.

116
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,079
Your daughter is recovering very well.

117
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,120
Thank you.

118
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,319
Xiaowan

119
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,560
How are you feeling?

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm fine now, Uncle Ying.

121
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,480
It's all thanks to you this time.

122
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:35,680
Alright.

123
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,279
Let me tell you,

124
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,879
if anything happens in the future,

125
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,560
you can't run around on your own.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,720
Don't act alone.

127
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,560
Look how scared you made your mom.

128
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Don't worry, Mom.

129
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,279
Nothing bad will happen again.

130
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,800
Huiming

131
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,720
Thank you.

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,360
No need to thank me.

133
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,879
This is what I should do.

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,199
Xiaowan is your family.

135
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,720
It's my duty to protect her.

136
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
But I really didn't expect

137
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,439
the person I've been looking for

138
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,639
was actually right by my side.

139
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,399
I didn't expect it either.

140
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,560
After so many years,

141
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,399
we could still meet again.

142
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,040
Xiaowan

143
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,639
Mom will definitely save you.

144
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,000
Mom will never let your leg get hurt again.

145
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,199
What Mom said when she saved me

146
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,000
was as if she knew I was burned in my previous life.

147
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,800
And also,

148
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,519
Mom didn't know medicine at all in her previous life.

149
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,879
You knew she was allergic to seafood.

150
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,000
Yet you let her eat seafood.

151
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,519
Food poisoning can be fatal.

152
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,319
But if Mom really came back like I did,

153
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,799
why would she still marry Jin Hanliang?

154
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,559
Why not get a divorce?

155
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,639
The former workshop director of our factory, Su Mingyue, colluded with local thugs

156
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,080
to frame her colleague Lin Han

157
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,600
and was later suspected of attempted kidnapping and murder

158
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,720
which are serious violations of the law

159
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,519
The factory has decided to dismiss Su Mingyue effective immediately

160
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,000
and hand her over to the police for investigation

161
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,879
We have zero tolerance for such behavior

162
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,480
Su Mingyue

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,960
You stole my letter

164
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,159
and told Jin Hanliang

165
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,679
You even encouraged him to kidnap me

166
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,039
I never understood

167
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,240
why you were so determined to destroy me

168
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,840
Is it because of Ying Huiming?

169
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,679
Lin Han

170
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Don’t look at me like you’re above everyone else

171
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,639
Aren’t you after his status and money too?

172
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
You’re just a tramp

173
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
What makes you think you can compare to me?

174
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,120
Su Mingyue

175
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,039
You are no longer an employee of Jinlin

176
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,080
Director Ying asked me to hand you over to the police

177
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,879
to be dealt with according to the law

178
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,600
If I can’t have it easy, neither can you
