1
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,000
Alright.

2
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,920
The acupuncture is finished.

3
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,040
Great-grandmother.

4
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,359
Grandmother.

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,040
Lin Han.

6
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,280
You're killing people.

7
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,159
Mom.

8
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,560
What's going on here?

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:23,879
Mom.

10
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,879
Uncle Ying.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,599
You're finally back.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's all because of this woman.

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,079
Some country quack from who knows where.

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
She actually dared to treat grandma.

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,879
Who allowed you?

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,200
Dad.

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,280
Lin Han is a traditional Chinese medicine doctor.

18
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,439
And now isn't the time to argue about this.

19
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:40,879
Don't defend her.

20
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,319
Miss Lin.

21
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,480
Give me an explanation for this.

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't worry yet.

23
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,840
This is a normal rejection reaction.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,799
Just three minutes.

25
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,640
Grandma will wake up.

26
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,799
Look at the time.

27
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,079
You still dare to boast.

28
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,760
From what I see of grandma's condition,

29
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,400
it's not as simple as you say.

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,719
If after three minutes

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,680
my mother doesn't wake up, what then?

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,719
Then I, Lin Han,

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,439
will trade my life for hers.

34
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:30,800
Lin Han.

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,000
Didn't you say grandma would wake up in three minutes?

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,240
So why hasn't she woken up yet?

37
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:47,879
Grandma

38
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,240
How are you feeling?

39
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,159
Are you feeling any better?

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,599
Grandma feels much better.

41
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:53,879
Dad

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,240
Look, Grandma's lips have turned red again.

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,560
Grandma

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,199
Try moving your legs now.

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
Grandma, can you move them?

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,000
Give it a try.

47
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:13,759
They moved!

48
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:14,520
Mom

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,240
Your feet can move now.

50
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,599
Let me try again.

51
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,199
This foot can move too.

52
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,680
Both feet can move now.

53
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:32,840
Impossible.

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,439
This can't be.

55
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,520
Liu Yinyin

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
I'm telling you officially now.

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,919
You need to apologize to Lin Han for your rudeness just now.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,800
Otherwise, I'll end the cooperation with the Liu family.

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,680
I won't repeat myself.

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,159
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,919
Xiao Han

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,919
Grandma is so happy.

63
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,520
You're amazing.

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,520
Grandma's legs can move now.

65
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,639
Tomorrow at noon,

66
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,919
our family will host a banquet.

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,879
I want to treat my granddaughter-in-law well.

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,919
Come to Grandma.

69
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,240
Get out of here!

70
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:19,879
Out!

71
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
All of you, get out!

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,399
Out!

73
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,839
Oh dear.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,839
Yinyin...

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,079
My daughter...

76
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,000
You haven't been eating or drinking at all these days.

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,399
And you won't even let the servants take care of you.

78
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,000
It breaks your mother's heart.

79
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,000
Mom...

80
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,759
It's all that Lin Han's fault.

81
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,920
I've been childhood friends with Huiming for so many years.

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
Even though he's never said it,

83
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
I know he has feelings for me.

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,680
She's just a used woman,

85
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,439
how dare she come and interfere?

86
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:50,959
And also,

87
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,759
even Grandma Mu is on her side.

88
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,759
Don't cry, don't cry.

89
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,480
No more tears.

90
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,319
Be good, Yinyin. Don't cry.

91
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,920
A daughter of the Liu family

92
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,759
doesn't have to marry into the Ying family.

93
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,839
We won't marry you to that Ying boy.

94
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,920
He's not good enough for you.

95
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,639
Mom will find you someone better.

96
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,040
No!

97
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,199
I only want to marry Huiming.

98
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,560
It's all that remarried woman's fault.

99
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,839
Mom...

100
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,839
You have to help me.

101
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,519
Mom will help you, sweetheart.

102
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,240
I've wanted a princess room since I was a child.

103
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
This dream really did come true.

104
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,639
Mom.

105
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,680
If I sleep in this bed,

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,759
you can go sleep with Uncle Ying.

107
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,720
What are you saying, Xiaowan?

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I didn't say anything.

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm not staying here then.

110
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,959
Here is the key to this suite.

111
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,439
Usually, except for the maid coming to clean,

112
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,199
no one will bother you.

113
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,120
Let me know if you need anything.

114
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,560
I don't even know how to thank you.

115
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,079
How should you thank me?

116
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,439
Are you satisfied?

117
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,839
I'm satisfied.

118
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:27,720
I...

119
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,040
Um, Uncle...

120
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,120
I'll just go downstairs.

121
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,000
Go downstairs.

122
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,399
Uh, to get something.

123
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,240
Help your mom tidy up.

124
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,560
Okay.

125
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,000
You go on downstairs.

126
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,839
Don't let her get too tired.

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,519
Mom.

128
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,800
How do you like the dad I found for myself?

129
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,399
You're such a clever little rascal.

130
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,040
Once things settle down,

131
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
I'll send you to school first.

132
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,040
Learn some proper manners.

133
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,920
Or,

134
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,680
you could find me a boarding school.

135
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,480
So I can give you two some alone time.

136
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,079
How about that?

137
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,480
Where did you learn that?

138
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,439
What are you talking about?

139
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,879
I'm going to help Uncle Ying.

140
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,040
You little rascal.

141
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,319
Xiaowan

142
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,160
Grandma has a plan.

143
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,319
Do you want your mom and Uncle Ying

144
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,600
to get closer?

145
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,639
I do!

146
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,519
Grandma, what's your plan?

147
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,319
Tell me quickly!

148
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,600
Okay.

149
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,959
Tonight,

150
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,160
Grandma will set up a little accident.

151
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,720
When the time comes,

152
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,959
it'll be up to you.

153
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:00,839
How does that sound?

154
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:01,600
Sounds good!

155
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,959
Leave it to me.

156
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,839
Aunt Wang, bring a towel.

157
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,959
Such a big villa,

158
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,720
and only one bathroom has hot water?

159
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,319
That's so strange.

160
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,200
Aunt Wang.

161
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,679
Aunt Wang.

162
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,399
Aunt Wang.

163
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,639
I have a towel.
