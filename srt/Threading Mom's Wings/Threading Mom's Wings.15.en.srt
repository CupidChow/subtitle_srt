1
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,879
It was just that moment just now

2
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,760
that made me feel so happy.

3
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,680
From now on, I'll do my best.

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,640
From now on,

5
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,480
you don't have to answer right away.

6
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,799
I won't make things difficult for you.

7
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,200
Ying Huiming,

8
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,319
as long as on January 1st, 2000,

9
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,120
I can still stand in front of you,

10
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,079
let's be together.

11
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,200
What are you doing?

12
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,120
Trial period.

13
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's start from now.

14
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,080
I really wish time could pass a little slower.

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,199
Even slower.

16
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,560
Hello

17
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:38,960
What?

18
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,639
Okay, okay, I'll head back now.

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
What happened? What's going on?

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,719
My grandma suddenly fainted.

21
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,800
I have to go back right away.

22
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,479
I know some traditional Chinese medicine.

23
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,599
Let me go with you.

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,800
Mom

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,319
I got it.

26
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,080
Can you help me see how these clothes look?

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,680
Mom

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,080
Mom

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,599
What's wrong?

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,479
The Ying family said the old lady fainted again tonight.

31
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,080
They've already called doctors to the house.

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,319
They said

33
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,919
Given our many years of friendship with the Ying family,

34
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,319
some things

35
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,560
should be prepared for in advance.

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,520
Then Huiming should be back, right?

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,439
I'm just worried about him.

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,879
The old lady loves him the most.

39
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,120
Huiming has been gone for a month.

40
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,360
And you've been talking about him for a month.

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,319
If you ask me,

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,879
he's almost as important to you as I am.

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,719
Oh, how could that be?

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,000
Mom, you'll always be number one in my heart.

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I'll always love you the most.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,520
No one can ever replace you.

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,280
Huiming must be really upset right now.

48
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,039
Mom

49
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,520
I want to go see him.

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:41,879
Alright.

51
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,879
Then I'll prepare some supplements for you to take.

52
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,800
And take Dr. Liu with you as well.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Go check on the old lady.

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,759
Thank you, Mom.

55
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,039
Grandma is seriously ill. Huiming will definitely come back.

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,759
If we go over now,

57
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,439
maybe we can make the childhood engagement official.

58
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,840
Grandma.

59
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,360
Grandma.

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
You finally woke up.

61
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,959
I heard you fainted.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
I was so worried about you.

63
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,920
How many times have I told you

64
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,399
to call me Grandma Mu?

65
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,040
Stop being so loud and bossy all the time.

66
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,040
I just fainted for a moment.

67
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,199
How do you get news so quickly?

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,399
You old woman.

69
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,560
It's been over ten years.

70
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,000
No matter how much I act cute,

71
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,240
you always stay so stubborn.

72
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,759
Madam.

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,959
Huiming is back.

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,879
Grandma.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,439
I'm back.

76
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,240
I just got back and heard you fainted.

77
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,240
I was so worried.

78
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,639
How are you now?

79
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:52,759
Much better.

80
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,480
Brother Huiming.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,600
You finally came back.

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,360
Take better care of your health.

83
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,800
Don't keep making me worry.

84
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,279
Huiming,

85
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,600
It's so late.

86
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,920
Grandma is still sick.

87
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,680
How can you just bring outsiders into the house?

88
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,360
Aren't you afraid you'll disturb Grandma while she's recovering?

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
From what I see here,

90
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,000
you're the loudest one.

91
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,040
You're the one who talks the most.

92
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,639
Grandma is fine.

93
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,079
Don't worry.

94
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,759
This young lady—

95
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,240
Oh, right.

96
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,240
Grandma,

97
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,279
her name is Lin Han.

98
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,000
She's my girlfriend.

99
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,720
Hello, Great-Grandma.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,199
Good, good, good.

101
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,000
Huiming,

102
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,680
how can you just bring another woman into the house?

103
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,199
You should know that we still have a marriage agreement.

104
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,040
Don't listen to her nonsense.

105
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,959
I really don't know what to say to you.

106
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,600
Ever since you were little,

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,920
you've never known how to read the room.

108
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,439
If you can't speak properly, then don't speak.

109
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,040
I've told you so many times.

110
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,800
That childhood engagement was just a joke by the elders.

111
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,519
You actually took it seriously.

112
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,800
Let me tell you one last time.

113
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,560
I have no feelings for you at all.

114
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,480
Do you understand?

115
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,519
Lin Han is my girlfriend now.

116
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,040
She will also be the future mistress of the Ying family.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,759
What?

118
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,399
She's just a country girl.

119
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,920
What right does she have to be the mistress of the Ying family?

120
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,920
What right?

121
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,519
Okay.

122
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Nice name.

123
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,560
Han.

124
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,360
The sky is about to brighten.

125
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,800
A bright future awaits.

126
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,079
Xiao Han.

127
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,120
Grandma heard you know traditional medicine.

128
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,399
Come, come, come here.

129
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,839
Let Grandma take a look.

130
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,199
Stupid village girl.

131
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,319
You think you can rise up just by relying on your medical skills.

132
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,639
I won't let you get what you want.

133
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,040
Doctor Liu.

134
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,120
Hurry, come to the Ying family right now.

135
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
If I don't see you in five minutes,

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,079
don't bother coming again.

137
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,639
Xiaowan,

138
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,279
Grandma wants to ask you something.

139
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,120
What is it?

140
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,199
My grandson here,

141
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,199
how is he doing as your stepfather?

142
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,959
Has he bullied you and your mother?

143
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,279
If he ever bullies you two,

144
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,399
you tell Grandma.

145
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,959
Let Grandma deal with him.

146
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,360
No,

147
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,319
Grandma,

148
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,920
listen to what you're saying.

149
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,800
How could I possibly bully them?

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,160
I care about them so much.

151
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,199
Grandma,

152
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,560
your illness

153
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,360
might be caused by the incense in the room.

154
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,240
If you want the old lady to recover quickly,

155
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,759
the incense needs to be removed immediately.

156
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,279
Otherwise, it could be life-threatening.

157
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,639
Lin Han,

158
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,120
if you don't have real skills, stop showing off here.

159
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,399
You were brought here to treat Grandma,

160
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
what does incense have to do with it?

161
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,600
If I remember correctly,

162
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,439
this incense

163
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
was given to Grandma by you.

164
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,360
Doctor Liu,

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,039
they're saying the incense I gave Grandma made her sick.

166
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:37,799
Take a smell.

167
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,960
This incense

168
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,039
is made from traditional herbs and plants.

169
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,080
The old lady isn't actually allergic to pollen.

170
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,240
Even if she were, it wouldn't take this long to react.

171
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,759
Did you hear that, Huiming?

172
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,120
A country healer

173
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,080
and a city expert doctor—

174
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,080
you'd better not trust the wrong person.

175
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:16,759
Mom,

176
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,519
I just asked in the kitchen.

177
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,480
Great-grandma has indeed been eating dandelion and purslane regularly.

178
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,919
That makes sense.

179
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,120
Both of those wild greens can detoxify the body.

180
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,519
That's why your symptoms were delayed for half a year.

181
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,519
Also,

182
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,440
what caused grandma's allergy wasn't pollen.

183
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
It was the frankincense inside.

184
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,759
No wonder it took so long for the reaction to happen.

185
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,919
If it had happened earlier,

186
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,919
Huiming wouldn't have been able to leave Shanghai at all.

187
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,639
He definitely wouldn't have met this country girl.

188
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,240
If I'd known, I would have paid more attention to the kitchen.

189
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,799
Go on,

190
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,480
how do you explain this?

191
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,279
Grandma,

192
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,919
I just thought traditional remedies were hard to find,

193
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,320
so I bought it especially to please you.

194
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,279
Alright, that's enough.

195
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,480
Someone,

196
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,519
take this incense away and throw it out.

197
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,559
As for the rest,

198
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,440
take it back and use it yourself.

199
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,480
Stupid country girl,

200
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,720
I don't believe your medical skills are really that great.

201
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,879
If I'm not well, you won't be either.

202
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Sister Lin,

203
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
since your medical skills are so impressive,

204
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,960
then easing grandma's condition should be no problem for you.

205
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,519
Grandma

206
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,120
Can you let me try first?

207
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,360
Okay

208
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,080
Lin Han

209
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,639
Don't pretend to know what you don't.

210
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,039
Grandma has been in a wheelchair for eight years.

211
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,559
Even Dr. Liu couldn't do anything.

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,519
If anything happens to Grandma,

213
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,519
can you take responsibility?

214
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,960
Miss Lin

215
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:04,879
A life is at stake.

216
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,759
You can't mess around.

217
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,320
Enough

218
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,519
I trust Xiao Han.

219
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,519
Xiao Han

220
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,360
Grandma believes in you.

221
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,120
Come

222
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,200
Let's begin.

223
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:17,679
Huiming

224
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,120
Then help me bring a basin of hot water.

225
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,639
Prepare two towels.

226
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,799
And some disinfectant alcohol.

227
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:23,679
Alright

228
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,120
Brother Huiming

229
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,960
Let me help.

230
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,399
Brother Huiming

231
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,879
My foot really hurts.

232
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,399
If you're sick, get treated.

233
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,879
The doctor is upstairs.

234
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,039
Brother Huiming, we grew up together as childhood friends.

235
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you really have no feelings for me at all?

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,519
Let go

237
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,240
I know you have me in your heart.

238
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,759
How could you possibly like that secondhand girl?

239
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,159
I've put up with you for a long time.

240
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,200
But about Ruxiang, was it really not on purpose?

241
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,879
I will never let you hurt them.

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,279
Get out

243
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,679
Miss Liu really is something, isn't she?

244
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,279
All these years,

245
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,000
Mr. Ying hasn't even spared her a proper glance.

246
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,200
Yet she's so determined,

247
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,039
treating herself as the future mistress of the Ying family.

248
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,559
What is she thinking?

249
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,200
Miss Liu and Mr. Ying are actually well-matched.

250
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,879
Some people want to climb the social ladder,

251
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,559
but they should first see if they're worthy.

252
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,519
You...

253
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,919
Why are you upset?

254
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,840
What did I say?

255
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,159
All done.

256
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,200
The acupuncture is finished.

257
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,159
Great-grandmother.

258
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:28,440
Grandmother.

259
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,679
Lin Han.

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,840
You're killing people.
