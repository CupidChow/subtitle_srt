1
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,039
Mom

2
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,200
Your first love wasn't actually Dad?

3
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,840
We weren't really each other's first love, were we?

4
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,439
After all, we never even met in person.

5
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,159
We just exchanged letters, that's all.

6
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,480
Besides,

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,359
the last letter I sent

8
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,239
still hasn't been answered.

9
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:27,000
You've never met, but you still can't forget him?

10
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,040
He must have been really charming.

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,599
Tell me about it!

12
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,280
That was the winter of 1990.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,840
Is there a letter for me today?

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,920
Xiaohan.

15
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,359
Yes, yes, yes! And the monthly report too.

16
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,400
Your article was published in the newspaper.

17
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,200
This is a letter from the newspaper.

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,040
It should be the payment for your article.

19
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,319
When I received the payment,

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,439
there was also a fountain pen hidden in the envelope.

21
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,280
Moonlit Night,

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,079
your article is like a light

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,040
that helped me out of my difficulties.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The strength and warmth in your words

25
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
helped me regain my courage.

26
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,319
Thank you.

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,319
May you continue to use your pen as a boat

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,400
to sail through the ocean of literature,

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,080
inspiring more people.

30
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,199
Thank you for being there.

31
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,680
I am the intern editor, Li Ming.

32
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,879
From that moment on,

33
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,599
we continued to correspond under pen names for over a year.

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,400
Then he said his vacation was over and he had to return to university.

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,360
He asked if I wanted to meet.

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,800
But the reply I gave

37
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,560
was never answered.

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,520
So did you ever go to his workplace to look for him?

39
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,199
I did.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,719
But they didn't know who that pen name belonged to either.

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,919
Later, I got married.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,919
Those letters weren't kept.

43
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,280
I just don't know

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,479
why I still kept this fountain pen.

45
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,960
So, life

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,560
is made up of all kinds of coincidences

47
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,000
and all sorts of regrets

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,639
If I had been with him back then

49
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,080
then there wouldn't be Xiaowan

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
It would be better if I didn't exist

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,159
If I didn't exist

52
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,840
it means you wouldn't have married my useless dad

53
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,159
you wouldn't have suffered so much

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,120
and gone through so much pain

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,759
You wouldn't even know

56
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,439
what would have happened

57
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,439
I know

58
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,159
You know?

59
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,080
I know

60
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,319
that I married the wrong person

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,400
but I don't regret it

62
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,520
Because for me, as your mother

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,800
heaven has already given me the most precious gift

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,280
having Xiaowan as my daughter

65
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,840
I would trade anything for that

66
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,439
So as for past regrets

67
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,879
let them stay in the past

68
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,279
Now I just feel

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,199
that every day

70
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,680
is a blessing

71
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,720
So you really don't want to ask

72
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,399
how Uncle Ying's pen came to be?

73
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,720
No, I won't ask

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
People who are meant to meet

75
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,160
will meet sooner or later

76
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,959
What's going on with Director Su's daughter now?

77
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,920
This time,

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
she finally met her match.

79
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,279
I heard that Director Ying's family

80
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,480
runs a company in Shanghai.

81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,920
She's just the daughter of a town director.

82
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,879
How can she possibly compare to them?

83
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,120
But we should still treat Lin Han better from now on.

84
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
What if she becomes the factory director's wife?

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,160
Miss,

86
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,519
are you an employee of Jinlin?

87
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,040
What do you want?

88
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:12,959
Um...

89
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,560
A letter for someone at your factory was sent to the wrong address.

90
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,199
Can you pass it on to him?

91
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,240
It's for Lin Han.

92
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,040
Well done.

93
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
Lin Han really is fickle in love.

94
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,800
She's flirting with Ying Huiming on one side,

95
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,720
and exchanging letters with her lover on the other.

96
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,360
Just wait and see how I deal with you.

97
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,639
Brother Jin,

98
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,079
what are you doing here?

99
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
I heard Lin Han is here.

100
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,240
I wanted to see my daughter.

101
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,160
So I came to take a look.

102
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,279
Brother Jin,

103
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,480
do you want

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,399
her to obediently go home with you?

105
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,959
Today,

106
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,519
thank you for treating me to lunch.

107
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
I have to go to the provincial capital tonight.

108
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,120
I won't be back until the day after tomorrow.

109
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,920
You and Xiaowan should be careful at the factory.

110
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,279
Call me if anything happens.

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay.

112
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,040
Driver, could you please go a bit faster?

113
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,279
My child is still waiting for me at home.

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,319
So you still remember you have a child?

115
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,480
You shameless, promiscuous woman.

116
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,040
Jin Hanliang.

117
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Mom said you had to be back before dinner.

118
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,360
Why aren't you here yet?

119
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,360
You little vixen.

120
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Shameless.

121
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
This is kidnapping.

122
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,399
What you're doing is illegal.

123
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,199
Illegal.

124
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,319
You're my wife.

125
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,519
It's only right that I come looking for you.

126
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,279
You enjoy having dinner with other men, don't you?

127
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,319
One isn't enough for you?

128
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,079
You even write letters to seduce other men.

129
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:01,920
Sit down.

130
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,079
Sit down.

131
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,120
Give it back to me.

132
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,319
This is the thing your lover gave you, isn't it?

133
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,079
Fine.

134
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,639
I'll destroy it today.

135
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,120
Give it to me.

136
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,759
Let go.

137
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,680
How can you be so shameless?

138
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,319
I knew something was off about you.

139
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,920
Now I know why you want a divorce.

140
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,000
I finally caught you today.

141
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,199
Shameless.

142
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,639
Dawn.

143
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,519
I'm still the night.

144
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,000
Lin Han.

145
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,399
Your dawn may never come again.

146
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,159
Someone like you,

147
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,440
what right do you have to betray my brother?

148
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,440
I'll beat you to death.

149
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,919
Mom still hasn't come back this late.

150
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Something must have happened.

151
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,039
Xiaowan.

152
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,200
Where are you going so late at night?

153
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,279
My mom hasn't come back yet.

154
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,360
I'm going to look for her.

155
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,399
It's so late.

156
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
You little girl, don't run around.

157
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,960
Oh, right.

158
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,600
I saw your dad come by this morning.

159
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,440
He even chatted with Su Mingyue for quite a while.

160
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,919
Did your mom leave with him?

161
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,120
Oh no.

162
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,080
Security uncle.

163
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,919
Hurry and call Uncle Ying.

164
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,480
Then have him go to the village to look for us.

165
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,320
This little girl.

166
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,360
Mom, are you in there?

167
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,080
Mom.

168
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,919
Jin Hanliang, let my mom out!

169
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:36,639
Mom.

170
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,440
Show some respect.

171
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,159
What are you doing?

172
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,000
Why did you come here by yourself so late?

173
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
Mom, are you inside?

174
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,480
What did you say to Su Mingyue?

175
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,639
Let my mom out!

176
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,679
Nonsense.

177
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,879
I went to the garment factory this afternoon to see you and your mom.

178
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,960
I left when I didn't see you.

179
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't believe you.

180
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,960
Then see for yourself.

181
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
See if your mom is really there.

182
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,159
Mom.

183
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:06,799
Mom.
