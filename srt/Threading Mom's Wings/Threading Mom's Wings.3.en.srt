1
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,400
Xiaowan

2
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,079
Xiaowan

3
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,400
It's enough.

4
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,439
We finally have enough money.

5
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,560
Mom can finally take you away.

6
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,400
Mom

7
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,640
This is a good thing.

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,560
Why are you still crying?

9
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,040
A good thing.

10
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,359
It really is a good thing.

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,280
I just feel

12
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,799
that all of this doesn't feel real.

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,239
Mom

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,799
Your daughter really did it.

15
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,040
In my previous life,

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,120
I always woke up from nightmares,

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,439
dreaming of watching you suffer,

18
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,439
and being powerless to help you.

19
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,079
Now I've finally changed all of that.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:51,879
Mom

21
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,400
This is the first pot of gold we've earned together.

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,680
Good.

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,400
I'll help you make even more money.

24
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,959
So you'll have the confidence to fear no one.

25
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,920
The new millennium is almost here.

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,959
I want to take you out of here, Mom.

27
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,560
Seize the opportunities of this era.

28
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,400
Let my mom become a millionaire—

29
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,199
No,

30
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,639
a billionaire!

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,080
No more crying.

32
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,199
From now on, we'll face every day with a smile.

33
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,080
Hello, Lao Chen.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,800
The person I asked you to look into before,

35
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,599
how's it going?

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm in Xiangshui Town.

37
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,159
I saw someone who feels a lot like her.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,759
On a moonlit night.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,759
Could it be her?

40
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,039
As long as she's doing well,

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,599
just watching from afar

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
is enough for me.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,199
Three thousand yuan.

44
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,240
Keep the change.

45
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,960
Now can you let my mom and me go?

46
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,639
You want to leave?

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,360
Keep dreaming.

48
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,080
This liquor belongs to my big brother in the first place.

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,520
The money you made

50
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,560
just barely covers the cost.

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Didn't we agree yesterday?

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Now you want to go back on your word?

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,240
Does your Jin family have any shame left?

54
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,840
Say that again, you wretched woman!

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,000
Mom seems braver than in her previous life.

56
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,759
Is it because I came here

57
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,400
that Mom has been influenced by me?

58
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,599
Hanliang.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,439
They even returned the bride price.

60
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,080
If you're a man, you should let go.

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,639
First thing tomorrow morning,

62
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,159
you two go and get the paperwork done.

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,719
Sign the divorce papers.

64
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,319
Thank you, Director.

65
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,719
Mom.

66
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,599
I believe

67
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,840
that this time-travel

68
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,400
will definitely change our future.

69
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,560
Son,

70
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,479
Could it be

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,919
you're just going to stand by and watch

72
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
as your own wife

73
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,560
is taken away by another man?

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,280
Mom,

75
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,279
who would have thought she and her mother

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,040
would be this capable today?

77
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,639
If you ask me, brother,

78
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,879
it's because you're not capable enough.

79
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,120
You can't even keep an eye on a woman.

80
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,319
And you let someone guard her in the house.

81
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,480
You're really useless.

82
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,040
Aren't you ashamed?

83
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,560
Weren't you caught being someone's mistress?

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,120
The whole village knows you seduced an old man for money.

85
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,759
Stop!

86
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,240
Enough, what's the point of fighting?

87
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,759
Was it you?

88
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,279
That's enough!

89
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,439
Isn't the house already chaotic enough?

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,399
Sit down.

91
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,360
Sit down.

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,800
If you have the guts,

93
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,639
go fight someone outside.

94
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,079
Why are you fighting your own family?

95
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,839
Honestly.

96
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,959
Fine then.

97
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,000
A useless woman who can't even give birth to a son.

98
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,759
Why keep her around?

99
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,680
Son,

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,040
when we have money in the future,

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,759
I'll find you another wife.

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
Once our family is rich, what kind of wife can't we get?

103
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,279
Right?

104
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,639
It's just this little jinx.

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
I haven't dealt with her yet.

106
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,439
Let me tell you all,

107
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,079
I can't swallow this anger.

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,800
Mom,

109
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,560
I have a way.

110
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,600
This family,

111
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,160
I can finally take Xiaowan and leave.

112
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,519
Wife,

113
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,360
I know

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,959
I've wronged you all these years.

115
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,759
But couples shouldn't hold grudges overnight.

116
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,079
I've thought about it seriously.

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
If you help me have another son,

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,000
we'll have both a son and a daughter.

119
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,839
Let's live a good life together.

120
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,279
Jin Hanliang,

121
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,040
I'm not a childbearing tool for your Jin family.

122
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,319
And let me tell you,

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,079
I, Lin Han, can waste my own life,

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,560
but my daughter

125
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,439
must never repeat my mistakes.

126
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,399
So this marriage,

127
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm definitely getting a divorce.

128
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,000
Are we getting divorced or not?

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,519
It's not up to you.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,680
What do you mean?

131
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,240
Does it taste good?

132
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,680
Is everything arranged?

133
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,720
Why am I here?

134
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,240
Hello, bro.

135
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,199
The goods I told you about

136
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
have already been brought to town.

137
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,480
Don't worry.

138
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,160
The little girl is unharmed.

139
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,800
The Jin family actually wants to sell me.

140
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,439
Tell me, where should I deliver the goods?

141
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,800
Xiaowan.

142
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,680
Where are we going?

143
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,720
Is Da-ge here?

144
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,279
I've brought my goods.

145
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,360
It's just a girl.

146
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,399
Wait for me.

147
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,759
Let's go.

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,560
This place clearly isn't safe.

149
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,759
If I go in there as a kid,

150
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,319
I'm afraid things won't end well.

151
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:28,920
No.

152
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,920
I need to find a way to escape.

153
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,919
The land in the east of the city has been worthless for years.

154
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,320
If they want it,

155
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,919
then just sell it.

156
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,720
For how much?

157
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,440
It's better than holding onto it and losing everything.

158
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,879
I'm hanging up.

159
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,600
Go in.
