1
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:02,759
Go in.

2
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,079
So you're the one Jin Jie brought in.

3
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,239
Looks like your arms and legs are all intact.

4
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,480
You don't seem like an idiot either.

5
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:14,879
Go.

6
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,879
Go give Jin Jie the money.

7
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,480
Take this girl

8
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,560
and dump her as far away as possible.

9
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:21,439
Yes.

10
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:21,920
Boss.

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,799
Uncle.

12
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,319
The land in the east of the city can't be sold.

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,000
You brat.

14
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,879
It's not your turn to speak yet.

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,480
If you don't believe me,

16
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,280
go ask around in Xiangshui Town.

17
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,959
My name is Jin Xiaowan.

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm good at fortune-telling.

19
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,840
Then let's hear what you have to say.

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Why can't it be sold?

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,079
I calculated it.

22
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,599
I heard there's a girl in Xiangshui Village who's good at fortune-telling.

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
That wouldn't be you, would it?

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,400
Da-ge.

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,800
Didn't you just get divorced?

26
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,520
You used your house to pay off debts too.

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,879
And this pool hall hasn't been yours for a long time.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,599
You brat.

29
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,599
What nonsense are you spouting?

30
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,439
All of you, get out!

31
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,199
Get out!

32
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,520
How do you know about these things?

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,039
Do you know my wife?

34
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,240
Da-ge

35
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,000
I really figured it out myself.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,199
They're going to build a mall in the east of the city after the New Year.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,360
Someone's trying to buy land from you now and even bargaining down the price.

38
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,199
They must have gotten some inside information.

39
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,759
If you don't believe me,

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,879
go ask around.

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,599
It's not like I can run away anyway.

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,039
Look into something for me.

43
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,919
Mom should notice the handkerchief I threw to her, right?

44
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,240
What if she doesn't notice it?

45
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,039
What should I do then?

46
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:47,759
I'm doomed.

47
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,599
Did I guess wrong?

48
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,800
But he wouldn't go so far as to kill me to keep me quiet, right?

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,159
What do I do now?

50
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,280
Jin Xiaowan

51
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,159
Calm down.

52
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,280
Think of something, quick.

53
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,520
Little Immortal

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,319
Your predictions are so accurate.

55
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
The pain in my heart

56
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,199
I haven't told anyone.

57
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,639
I've never told anyone.

58
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,000
How did you know?

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,800
Immortal

60
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,040
Since your predictions are so accurate,

61
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,040
I'm begging you.

62
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,319
Please help me.

63
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,519
Of course, of course.

64
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,199
I just did a reading for you.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,360
The reason you're down on your luck now

66
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,439
is all because

67
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,800
there's a petty person around you holding you back.

68
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,839
This person is

69
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,600
less than ten meters away from you.

70
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,399
I understand.

71
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,319
I understand, I understand.

72
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,199
Thank you, Little Immortal.

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,240
What are you doing?

74
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,279
Let go of me!

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,639
Little Immortal!

76
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,439
The person you mentioned

77
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,639
is her, right?

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,079
Yes, Da Ge.

79
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,240
She has water in her fate.

80
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,360
You have a lot of fire in your fate.

81
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,800
Water can extinguish fire.

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,360
It can even make your fine blade rust.

83
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,560
She really is a bringer of bad luck.

84
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,879
Da Ge,

85
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,800
don't believe her.

86
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,160
She's just a little liar.

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,040
Jin Xiaowan, what nonsense are you talking about?

88
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,800
No respect for your elders.

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,160
How dare you be disrespectful to the little immortal!

90
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,000
You wretched woman!

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,800
I'll sell you off to the mountains right now.

92
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,160
The farther you go, the better.

93
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,879
What are you doing?

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,000
Help!

95
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,279
This is illegal!

96
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,360
Go, quickly!

97
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Run!

98
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,839
Go, go, go!

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,639
Nothing this shameful has ever happened in our Xiangshui Village.

100
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,079
You need to teach your daughter better in the future.

101
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,399
Get out of the way.

102
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,040
You're already so grown up,

103
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,959
and you can't even handle that little girl.

104
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,959
You can't even deal with her.

105
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,079
You've really disgraced our Jin family.

106
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,480
Who knew she would be so clever?

107
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,319
She knows everything.

108
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:14,600
Enough.

109
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,879
I'll deal with you when we get home.

110
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:21,800
Go

111
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,279
If we really let the mother and daughter leave,

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
I really can't swallow this anger.

113
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,399
What did you just say?

114
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,399
Them

115
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,560
How do they know everything?

116
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,319
Yeah, how do they know everything?

117
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:35,800
Oh, Mom

118
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,079
It's not that mysterious.

119
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,199
But

120
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,959
I actually thought of a way.

121
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,000
What way?

122
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,480
Yesterday your dad drugged me.

123
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,160
When I woke up, I couldn't find you anywhere.

124
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,480
Luckily, I found your handkerchief at the entrance of the billiard hall.

125
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,000
We can't stay here another day.

126
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,839
We have to leave quickly.

127
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,360
Mom

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,600
No rush.

129
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,439
In a bit, help me buy something at the entrance of the village.

130
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,560
Go quickly.

131
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,720
Go.

132
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,759
If you are heartless,

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,120
then don't blame me for being unjust.

134
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,879
Villagers,

135
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,720
I

136
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,560
observed the stars last night

137
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,240
and discovered that there is an evil spirit causing trouble in our village.

138
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,399
After some calculations,

139
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,800
this evil spirit

140
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,920
is hiding in this very house.

141
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,000
Evil spirit!

142
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,120
I heard that their little girl has caused quite a few problems lately.

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,560
Could it be her?

144
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,600
Wasn't that girl telling fortunes at the village entrance a few days ago?

145
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,160
This must have something to do with her.

146
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,759
Daoist priest,

147
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,800
our little girl

148
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,519
has been acting differently since she had a fever.

149
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,040
It's like she's become a different person.

150
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,360
She's a jinx.

151
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,600
Whoever she curses, it comes true.

152
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,079
Actually,

153
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,319
our family's bad luck isn't a big deal.

154
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,199
The main thing is,

155
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,240
I'm afraid we'll bring misfortune to the villagers.

156
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,560
This girl

157
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,480
must be possessed by an evil spirit.

158
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,040
If we don't deal with it quickly,

159
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,399
there will be disaster.

160
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,680
What should we do?

161
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Daoist priest, please!

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm begging you, please save me!

163
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,519
Daoist priest,

164
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,840
I

165
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,120
act on behalf of heaven and justice.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,639
Today,

167
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,080
I will exorcise this evil spirit.
