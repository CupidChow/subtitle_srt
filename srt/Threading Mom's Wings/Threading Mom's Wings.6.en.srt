1
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,640
Three, two, one

2
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,200
Happy divorce

3
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:06,799
Cheese

4
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,959
You two really look alike

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,280
Thank you

6
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,439
Mom

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,959
Why are you crying?

8
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,200
I was just thinking

9
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,959
Since you were born

10
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,959
this is the first photo we've taken together

11
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,799
I wonder about our Xiaowan

12
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,480
what she'll be like when she grows up

13
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,519
and if she'll have a good life

14
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,239
Mom, you know what?

15
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,799
I'll look a lot like you

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,200
And with you by my side

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,959
I'll definitely have a good life

18
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,359
But right now, we don't even have a place to live

19
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,439
I'm not afraid of hardship

20
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,359
I'm just worried Xiaowan will have to

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
suffer along with us

22
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,000
Mom, don't worry

23
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,040
As long as we're together

24
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,719
things will definitely get better

25
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,960
Xiaowan

26
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,599
The clothing factory in town

27
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,599
was among the first to go from state-owned to private

28
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,759
I heard

29
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,800
only truly skilled people get in

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,039
Do you think I can do it?

31
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,520
My mom is obviously amazing

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,520
but she has so little confidence in herself

33
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,680
Mom, with me here

34
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,879
you can be completely at ease

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,479
Let's go, let's go

36
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:57,039
My mom is the most amazing in the world

37
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,599
Mom's hands are the most skillful

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,680
Little girl

39
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,400
All the positions at our factory have already been filled.

40
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,000
You should try looking somewhere else.

41
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,800
Uncle Manager

42
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,319
Has the garment factory recently had a batch of goods

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,319
stockpiled and unable to sell?

44
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,479
How did you know that?

45
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,800
We haven't told anyone about this.

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,400
To be honest, I have a knack for figuring things out.

47
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,520
My mom is the one who can help you solve this problem.

48
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:43,919
Manager

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,080
Is this house really for us to live in?

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,199
This is the factory dormitory.

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,080
If you can really solve the stockpiling issue,

52
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,360
you can become a full-time employee.

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
Once you have enough years of service, housing will be assigned automatically.

54
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,439
Leave it to us.

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't worry, Uncle.

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,400
Alright.

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,439
Then you two go ahead and get settled.

58
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,039
I'll be leaving now.

59
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,280
Let me walk you out.

60
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:04,840
Okay, thank you.

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,400
Take care.

62
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,319
Thank you.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,639
This is great, Xiaowan.

64
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,240
This is wonderful.

65
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
I didn't expect the two of us to have a new home so soon.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
Mom will definitely work hard.

67
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,279
So that Xiaowan can have her own place as soon as possible.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
So the person Jin Jie mentioned was her.

69
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
She really is something.

70
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,399
She got into the garment factory as soon as she arrived.

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,040
This job is something Xiaowan helped me get.

72
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,800
I'll definitely do my best.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,040
Why are you putting all sorts of dirty things on the table?

74
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,839
If you dirty the fabric, can you take responsibility?

75
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,839
Is this a place for a penniless beggar like you?

76
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,120
I'm talking to you.

77
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,120
Where are you from?

78
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,199
Look at this fabric.

79
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,399
It's all wrinkled.

80
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,040
I wouldn't even use this scrap as a rag at home.

81
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,959
And yet someone actually dares to wear it.

82
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,720
Don't touch me.

83
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,319
You actually dared to push me.

84
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,319
Mingyue, sis.

85
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,360
I think she snuck in here to steal something.

86
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,839
Hurry and call security to throw her out.

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,480
Speak.

88
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,199
How did you get in here?

89
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,240
If you don't explain yourself clearly,

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,720
I'll send you to the police station.

91
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,079
I didn't sneak in.

92
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,120
I'm a new employee who was hired here.

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,120
My name is Lin Han.

94
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,160
A new employee?

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,720
Since when did our factory start doing charity?

96
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Taking in shameless women.

97
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,439
What did you say?

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,199
I heard you bullied my friend Jin Jie.

99
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,920
Now that you're in my hands,

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
what do you think will happen to you?

101
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,959
So she's the Su Mingyue that Jin Jie always talks about.

102
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,079
Come on, come on.

103
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
Let me introduce her to everyone.

104
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
This person is Lin Han.

105
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,839
She's the infamous loose woman from Xiangshui Village.

106
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,079
No sense of decency.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,399
She made a mess at home and insisted on getting a divorce.

108
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,480
Nonsense!

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,160
That's not how it happened.

110
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,160
Everyone, listen to me—

111
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,120
Why should we listen to you?

112
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,040
Should we listen to why Manager Cheng made an exception to hire you,

113
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,439
or to how he brought you to the factory dormitory?

114
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,279
I'm saying you have no sense of propriety.

115
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,920
Or are you just promiscuous?

116
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,959
Everyone, tell me, can someone this immoral

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,199
stay in our factory?

118
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:27,439
No.

119
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,959
She can't stay, she can't stay.

120
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,959
Who's immoral?

121
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,639
Drag her out.

122
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,959
Drag her out.

123
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,920
Who's immoral?

124
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,399
Don't bully my mom!

125
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,199
My mom got this job on her own merit.

126
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,800
The divorce wasn't her fault either.

127
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,360
It's not your place to gossip about her.

128
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,759
You little brat.

129
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Just as ill-mannered as your mother.

130
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,120
Let go of me.

131
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,639
I'm telling you.

132
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,920
If you dare touch my daughter,

133
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,319
I'll pay you back tenfold.

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,879
We don't have to put up with this.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,319
Let's go.

136
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,360
Wait.

137
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,079
Ma'am,

138
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,759
do you dare make a bet with my mom?

139
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,480
You two are so poor, your pockets are cleaner than your faces.

140
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,120
What's there to bet on?

141
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,279
I know.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,120
The factory has unsold stock that's been piling up for half a year.

143
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,279
Let's bet on who can sell off the stock first.

144
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,560
If my mom wins,

145
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,720
you have to apologize to my mom in front of everyone.

146
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,399
If my mom loses,

147
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,079
we'll leave the factory.

148
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,720
Lin Han.

149
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,879
This stock has been sitting here for almost half a year.

150
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,360
No one in the factory can do anything about it.

151
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,480
Do you think you're some kind of deity?

152
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,439
I wouldn't dare call myself that.

153
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,120
But beating you is no problem.

154
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,800
I've mastered countless marketing strategies in my past life.

155
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,120
Any one of my cases would be unbeatable here.

156
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,959
So, do you dare or not?

157
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,839
Xiaowan is so brave for me.

158
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,519
As her mother,

159
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,000
I shouldn't back down either.

160
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,920
You little brat.

161
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,680
I can't be bothered with you.

162
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,839
Su Mingyue.

163
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,600
Do you dare to bet?

164
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,040
Are you scared?

165
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm not afraid of you.

166
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,079
It's this factory.

167
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,879
You and your daughter can't make the decisions.

168
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,560
She can't make the decisions.

169
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,480
But I can.

170
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,040
Isn't he the one who was collecting cotton that day?

171
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,759
I can't believe we ran into him here.

172
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,360
Who are you?

173
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,159
Why haven't I seen you before?

174
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,200
I am—

175
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,879
the new consultant at the factory.

176
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,360
My name is Ying Huiming.

177
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm responsible for inspecting the production processes in each department.

178
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,360
A consultant is just for show.

179
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,879
He doesn't even have any real authority.

180
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,360
And yet he's playing the hero here.

181
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,919
Hello, Consultant Ying.

182
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,480
I'm Su Mingyue, head of the production department.

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,720
Please give me your guidance.

184
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,559
I have a cleanliness obsession.

185
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,200
I don't like shaking hands.

186
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,480
What a coincidence.

187
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,440
We meet again.

188
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,960
Yeah.

189
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:34,759
Come on.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,840
Manager Cheng.

191
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,440
The new employee just arrived.

192
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,000
He's not familiar with the environment yet.

193
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,840
Production is important.

194
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,679
But unity among the workers is even more important.

195
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:49,879
Please pay more attention to this.

196
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,200
Yes, yes.

197
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,559
What are you all staring at?

198
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,480
Get back to work!

199
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,080
Xiaolin

200
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,240
Your workstation is over here.

201
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,159
Sister Mingyue

202
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,240
Didn't they say he has a cleanliness obsession?

203
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,159
He doesn't like shaking hands.

204
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,320
Then why is he holding onto Lin Han and not letting go?

205
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,000
Isn't it obvious?

206
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,879
Uncle Ying just thinks your Sister Mingyue isn't clean enough.

207
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,080
This...

208
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,080
Little vixen

209
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:18,759
Just you wait

210
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,840
I'll show you how I'll deal with you

211
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,679
I heard that Old Mr. Ying went overseas to do business early on.

212
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,519
Now, among Shanghai's private enterprises,

213
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,759
half have shares owned by the Ying family.

214
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,559
Looking at it now,

215
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
Young Mr. Ying is also quite accomplished for his age.

216
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,519
Young Mr. Ying, why did you just now

217
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,799
hide your identity as the factory director in front of everyone?

218
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,039
Only by blending in with the employees

219
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,120
can I truly understand things at the grassroots level.

220
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,039
So

221
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,360
Manager Cheng, please help me keep it a secret for now.

222
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,000
So her name is Lin Han.

223
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,759
She just got divorced and has a daughter.

224
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,679
Since she wants to move on,

225
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,440
what I can do

226
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,720
is quietly support her from behind the scenes.
