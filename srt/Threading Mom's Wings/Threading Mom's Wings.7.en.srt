Come and take a look!

6
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,400

All are brand-name goods.

9
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,400
Buying is earning!

10
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,760
You haven't paid yet.

11
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,959
Su Mingyue.

12
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,680
Selling like this, you'll lose money.

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,840
Lose money?

14
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,599
The Su family is never short of money.

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,400
As long as it gets you out of the garment factory,

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
this little money is nothing.

17
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,239
Selling at a loss.

18
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,040
That's right.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,000
Mom.

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,079
Trust me.

21
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,000
Su Mingyue cares a lot about her reputation.

22
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,519
As long as you provoke her,

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,280
she'll totally lose her head.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,879
But even if she wins the competition,

25
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,280
won't she still lose money?

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,959
She won't lose, Mom.

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,719
Just do as I say.

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,400
Don't worry.

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,560
7 yuan per item.

30
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,560

7 yuan per item now!

32
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,919
10 yuan, 10 yuan for three items!

33
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,919
10 yuan for three items!

34
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,759
Thank you!

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,840
Su Mingyue.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,240
Don't push people too far.

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,120
Lin Han.

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,639
I heard that a person's luck

39
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,000
can be passed on through the things they handle.

40
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,240
You're divorced and raising a child—your life is really tough.

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,879
You bought her stuff

42
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,199
Aren't you afraid of getting bad luck?

43
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:56,680
Su Mingyue

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,199
I earn my money with my own hands

45
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,840
What's so shameful about getting divorced?

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,960
That fortune-telling daughter of yours

47
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,000
Why didn't she predict you'd lose so badly?

48
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,080
Who says we lost?

49
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,319
Everyone, let's stop pretending

50
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,240
Let's show this fool who can't see the truth

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
Hello, Da-ge. Hello, little fortune-teller

52
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,000
What are you all doing?

53
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,560
Can't you see what's going on?

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,240
You sold at a loss

55
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,960
My mom bought the goods cheaply

56
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,199
Thanks to Aunt Su for delivering the goods and giving us money

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
Lin Han, how dare you trick me

58
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,039
Stop

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,879
What's going on?

60
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,920
Consultant Ying, you came at just the right time

61
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,160
Lin Han

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
She set me up

63
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,319
She took my goods and made me lose money

64
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,600
She even pushed me

65
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:24,800
I pushed?

66
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,560
With so many people squeezing around,

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
isn't it normal to bump into each other?

68
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,560
You're out here working,

69
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,399
so don't be so sensitive.

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
Consultant Ying,

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,120
Lin Han,

72
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,920
you did well today.

73
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,639
I just want to know,

74
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:52,920
next,

75
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,560
how are you going to sell all these clothes?

76
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,120
Lin Han,

77
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,240
so what if you bought my clothes at a low price?

78
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,839
If you can't sell them, they'll just rot in your hands anyway.

79
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,160
You don't need to worry about that.

80
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,360
Xiaowan,

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,399
show your talent.

82
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,360
Nancheng Xiangshui.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,399
Nancheng Xiangshui.

84
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,600
Jinlin Garment Factory is having a big sale!

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,199
Our partner indulged in drinking, gambling, and other vices,

86
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
and racked up a debt of thirty-five thousand.

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,519
He ran off with his sister-in-law.

88
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,600
He ran away.

89
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,800
There's nothing we can do.

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,279
Hurry up!

91
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,480
Take the clothes as payment for your wages.

92
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,160
Hurry, hurry!

93
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,480
Move faster!

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,000
You're so slow!

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,360
Everything is five yuan now!

96
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,839
All for five yuan!

97
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,720
There's also a large batch of trendy styles.

98
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,079
It's happening tomorrow.

99
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,879
Jinlin Warehouse Order Fair.

100
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,040
Come and check it out!

101
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,360
Mom, all the invitations have been sent out.

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,800
How's your preparation going?

103
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,759
Don't worry.

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,879
I won't embarrass you.

105
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,439
What's wrong?

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,399
Mom.

108
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,879
You're a living advertisement.

109
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,199
Watch me do a magic trick for you.

110
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,839
Look, what's this?

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,759
A sock.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,519
What are you going to do?

113
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,439
You'll know in a moment.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,680
Isn't it good?

115
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,959
Do another one.

116
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,439
Will this work?

117
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,879
It's not over yet.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,600
Perfect.

119
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,519
Consultant Ying

120
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,120
Is there something you need from me this late?

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,519
I...

122
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,199
I...

123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,439
I just finished my walk.

124
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,360
Come up for a drink.

125
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,639
No, that's not it.

126
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,639
It's like this.

127
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,920
I had someone bring sample clothes from Hong Kong, China.

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,040
The factory won't start production until next month.

129
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,800
See if they can help you at tomorrow's order meeting.

130
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,199
Really?

131
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,519
Then...

132
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,240
Thank you.

133
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,160
But...

134
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,920
You know my size?

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm a professional in fashion.

136
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,160
I can tell at a glance.

137
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,199
Today, you...

138
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,639
look very nice.

139
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,839
You're blushing.

140
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:29,879
I had some wine.

141
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,320
I...

142
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,399
I put on blush on purpose.

143
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,679
I...

144
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,799
I'll head back now.

145
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:48,600
Okay.

146
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,440
Remember to try on the dress.

147
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,240
Thank you.

148
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,679
The way he looked at me just now...

149
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,440
Does he like me?

150
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,039
Or am I just overthinking it?

151
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,559
After all, I'm divorced and have a child.

152
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,399
He and I...
