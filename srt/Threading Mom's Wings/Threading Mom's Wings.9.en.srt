1
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,000
The new factory director's assistant

2
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,840
will be Lin Han from now on.

3
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,920
Her direct supervisor

4
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,920
is

5
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,799
this nasty woman.

6
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,200
You have to give me an explanation today.

7
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,159
Why are you just standing there?

8
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:23,519
Let's go.

9
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:27,640
Come on.

10
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,920
Take a look.

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,799
This is what happens when you wear your factory's clothes.

12
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,040
It ends up like this.

13
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,319
Impossible.

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,359
We use good materials, this can't happen.

15
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,519
If you don't give me an explanation today,

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,560
do you believe I'll report you to the county committee right now?

17
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,120
I'll have your factory shut down immediately.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,480
Sir,

19
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,799
can I take a look at the clothes you bought?

20
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,400
What?

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,039
Are you saying I'm trying to scam you?

22
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,120
I'm scamming you?

23
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:16,879
Here.

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,039
Everyone, take a look.

25
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,520
This is your factory's clothing.

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,479
This is the clothing that made my wife end up like this.

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,159
Lin Han,

28
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,719
this

29
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,439
isn't this that "Millennium Trend" style you sold?

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,319
All the factory's clothes are quality-checked.

31
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,879
I think you just wanted a bargain.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,240
Used cheap parts,

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
and caused an allergic reaction, right?

34
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,599
Sir, please calm down first.

35
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,759
If the problem is with our clothes,

36
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,719
I will definitely compensate you.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,439
But

38
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,639
we need to provide evidence first, right?

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:02:59,960
Here,

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,479
I am the person in charge of the factory.

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,479
If you have any questions, you can ask me directly.

42
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,000
If this piece of clothing

43
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,400
really is a problem from our factory,

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,319
how much compensation do you want?

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,280
How do you want to handle it?

46
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,439
I won't short you a single cent.

47
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,240
Factories like yours with no conscience

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,319
should be smashed.

49
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,639
Smash it!

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,560
Mom

51
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,840
They're hitting people! They're hitting people!

52
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,439
They're hitting people!

53
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,120
Someone from your factory hit someone.

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,400
It was clearly your clothes that hurt someone.

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,319
And now you're bullying people.

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,599
Call the police right now.

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,479
We can't call the police.

58
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,319
We can't call the police.

59
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:43,840
Let them call.

60
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,800
Let them call.

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,400
Mom

62
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,080
I think there's something wrong with this lady.

63
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,039
Miss

64
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,000
Miss

65
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,439
Can I take a look at your injury?

66
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,199
Show her.

67
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,120
What are you afraid of?

68
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,199
Why are you being so shy?

69
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:09,879
That's strange.

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,759
Why is there a rash on your neck?

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,600
Xiaowan

72
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,879
Go back to the dorm and get the allergy medicine from Mom's desk.

73
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,120
Her face is turning pale.

74
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,759
It’s probably caused by a food allergy.

75
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,639
If she doesn’t take the medicine soon,

76
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,000
she could be in life-threatening danger.

77
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,279
Go.

78
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,079
Da Ge, I have an emergency. Come here.

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,800
What is it?

80
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,079
Your wife is having such a severe allergic reaction,

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,600
yet instead of taking her to the hospital, you come here to cause trouble.

82
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,360
A husband like this,

83
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,519
if you don’t divorce him,

84
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,879
are you keeping him around for the holidays?

85
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,759
I think you all

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,279
just don’t want to admit it, right?

87
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:03,920
Go ahead, say it.

88
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,680
How do you want to handle this?

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,680
Er Lai Zi

90
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,720
Jinlin is an old factory.

91
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,959
The factory's employees are all from the neighborhood.

92
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,480
Can you do it for my sake, Su Mingyue?

93
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,600
Give me some face.

94
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,879
As long as you fire her,

95
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,639
this matter will be considered resolved.

96
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,319
Is that okay?

97
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,519
No problem.

98
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,560
Wait.

99
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,360
So you mean,

100
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,480
if I fire her,

101
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,639
this whole thing never happened?

102
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,360
That's right.

103
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,000
Lin Han

104
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,439
Do you really think you're that attractive?

105
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,079
That men will revolve around you?

106
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
I'd like to see

107
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,600
if Ying Huiming will help you.

108
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,959
Hey, Ying,

109
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,600
you seem like a decent guy.

110
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,639
Don't ruin your future

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,319
for a woman.

112
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,120
Let me make myself clear today.

113
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm standing right here today.

114
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,959
No one can bully any of our factory's employees.

115
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,160
Consultant Ying,

116
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
you really think you're something, don't you?

117
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,439
For this woman who's already been dumped,

118
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,319
are you willing to give up your own job?

119
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:27,839
Actually,

120
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,920
there's one more thing I haven't announced yet.

121
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,360
Lin Han's direct supervisor,

122
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,399
the new director of Jinlin Garment Factory,

123
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,959
is me.

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,079
What?

125
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,079
You're the new director?

126
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,439
You're the one everyone's been talking about,

127
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,680
the new successor of the factory?

128
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,560
Uncle Ying became the director!

129
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,600
That's a big surprise!

130
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,839
Wha-what's wrong with the director?

131
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,959
Do you believe

132
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,120
I'll go out to the street right now and spread the word,

133
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,319
let all the neighbors see your ugly faces.

134
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,199
No need.

135
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:05,759
Director Ying,

136
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,519
I take full responsibility for my own actions.

137
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,240
If it really was my clothes that had a problem,

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040
I'll leave the garment factory voluntarily.

139
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,519
Leaving the factory isn't enough.

140
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,240
There has to be compensation.

141
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,720
Three times the amount.

142
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:22,839
No, that's not right.

143
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,439
What was the rule?

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,319
If it's fake, pay ten times.

145
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,399
You have to pay ten times the compensation.

146
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,800
Otherwise,

147
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
every one of you

148
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,399
can wait to go to jail.

149
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,240
That's right.

150
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,319
There should be compensation.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,240
Mom,

152
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
I brought the medicine you asked for.

153
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,399
But my mom isn't the one who should compensate.

154
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,120
Auntie, you're clearly allergic to seafood.

155
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Why did you go to the seafood market this morning

156
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,720
and buy three pounds of clams?

157
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,120
Brother Da, I have an urgent matter.

158
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,839
Can you come over?

159
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,439
And help me look into someone while you're at it.

160
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:06,959
Little Immortal,

161
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,160
I've found the person.

162
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
You really predicted it accurately.

163
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,199
As for this Erlai,

164
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,639
He usually won't even let his wife eat meat.

165
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,720
But today he actually bought two kilos of seafood.

166
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:16,920
Just like you said,

167
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:17,759
You know, that thing you mentioned—

168
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,040
What was it, "ci"?

169
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:19,720
No,

170
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,040
"Pengci"—faking an accident.

171
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,839
Isn't he obviously faking it?

172
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,240
How is he not?

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,039
This, this, this—

174
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,399
What's wrong with buying clams?

175
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,759
Can't someone just have a craving and eat?

176
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,639
You wear gold and silver yourself,

177
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,559
but your wife's clothes are all torn.

178
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
How could you possibly buy

179
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,559
new clothes from the trade fair?

180
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,519
And another thing,

181
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,240
you know she's allergic to seafood,

182
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,399
yet you let her eat it.

183
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,720
Food poisoning can be fatal.

184
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,879
Someone like that doesn't even care about your life.

185
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,960
And you're still speaking up for him?

186
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:01,720
Covering for him?

187
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,200
Are you going to go to jail for him?

188
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,360
Remember

189
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,320
The person who truly cares about you

190
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,360
would never want to hurt you.

191
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,279
You're still defending him now

192
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,320
Is it worth it?

193
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,480
It was him.

194
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,799
He forced me to eat the clams to frame you.

195
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,840
You wretched woman!

196
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,600
Looks like you need a beating.

197
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,759
Hitting women—

198
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,399
Can you act like a decent person?

199
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,720
All you do is hit women every day.

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Can you act like a real man?

201
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,440
He took someone else's money to cause trouble.

202
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,600
I almost lost my mind.

204
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,639
I almost hurt you.

205
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,320
You wretched woman!

206
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,679
Do you believe me or not?

207
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,759
I'm divorcing you today!

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,720
Fine, let's divorce!

209
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,519
You—

210
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,840
All you do is drink and gamble all day.

211
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,240
If I don't give you money, you hit me.

212
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,960
I don't want to live like this anymore.

213
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,600
You're just an old shoe I've worn out.

214
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,120
I don't believe anyone would want you now.

215
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,240
In this world

216
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,320
there are too many people who have suffered like my mother.

217
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,559
Let me tell you,

218
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,480
if she leaves you,

219
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,240
she won't be depressed at all.

220
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,000
She'll live an even better life.

221
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,600
Even her own mother doesn't want her anymore.

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,879
If she leaves me,

223
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,080
she'll have nothing to live on.

224
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,120
Our factory will keep her.

225
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,039
You—

226
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,759
You scoundrel!

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,679
Brother Da,

228
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,799
what brings you here?

229
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,360
Can't I come?

230
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,360
Of course you can, of course!

231
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Do you know

232
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,519
that Little Immortal's mother is like my own mother?

233
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,919
If you mess with her, you mess with me.

234
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,159
Brother Da,

235
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:56,679
do you understand?

236
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,120
Brother Da,

237
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,960
Brother Da, Brother Da!

238
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
It was Su Mingyue who told me to do it.

239
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,120
Brother Da,

240
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,200
she made me do it.

241
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,759
It was her.

242
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,679
Get lost!

243
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,039
Su Mingyue

244
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,240
You resort to dirty tricks when you can't handle losing.

245
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,720
That's really low of you.

246
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,159
Did you not think about it when you used her?

247
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,759
Aren't you a woman too?

248
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,639
Lin Han

249
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,720
Stop judging me from your moral high ground.

250
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,480
If she married poorly, that's just her fate.

251
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,639
What does that have to do with me?

252
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,639
Besides,

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,960
How can you accuse me just based on a few words?

254
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,919
And say I was behind it?

255
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,039
Because

256
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,039
Your fingerprints are on the money you gave him.

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,519
Su Mingyue

258
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,639
So, should I take you to the police to confess,

259
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,919
or will you leave Jinlin on your own?

260
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,320
You decide.

261
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,519
Lin Han

262
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,320
Don't you have anything you want to ask me?

263
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,720
For example,

264
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,320
why I kept this from you?

265
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,159
Aren't you angry that I hid it from you?

266
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,159
I'm not angry.

267
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,399
Because I trust you.

268
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
I believe you had your reasons

269
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,039
for doing this.

270
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,639
Besides,

271
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,759
whether as Consultant Ying or Director Ying,

272
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,600
what I see

273
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,879
is someone who speaks up for the weak

274
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,480
and protects me—Ying Huiming.

275
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,559
So I believe

276
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,840
with Director Ying here,

277
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,320
Jinlin will definitely do even better.

278
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,320
Thank you.

279
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,720
I believe together we can

280
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,919
make the garment factory thrive.

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,679
Mom, what are you looking for?

282
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,840
Found it.

283
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,240
This fountain pen.

284
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,519
It looks just like Uncle Ying's.

285
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,639
I've seen him use it all the time.

286
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,480
Even when the paint wore off, he never bought a new one.

287
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,279
I never noticed that before.

288
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,600
This fountain pen.

289
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,399
Was a gift from my first love.

290
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,399
We each had one.

291
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,039
Ying Huiming.

292
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,200
Could he be that person?

293
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,720
Or is this all just a coincidence?
