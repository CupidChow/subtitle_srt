1
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,600
If I'm not doing well, don't think you will either.

2
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,280
Are you okay?

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,879
W-Why is it you?

4
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,480
Are you alright?

5
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,200
Su Mingyue.

6
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,359
I will never like you.

7
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,319
My feelings aren't that cheap.

8
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,640
I don't just fall for someone so easily.

9
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,519
You stole my letter.

10
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,959
It only made me more certain of my choice.

11
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,480
Turns out, from beginning to end, I've only ever loved one person.

12
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,840
And that's Lin Han.

13
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,920
And your actions now

14
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,719
are not only despicable

15
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:53,840
but also filthy.

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,480
They only make people feel disgusted.

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,239
When someone does too many bad things,

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
they become uglier and uglier.

19
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,719
Just like you are now.

20
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,359
Lin Han.

21
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,280
Don't worry.

22
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm fine.

23
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,439
Let me handle things here.

24
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,759
This matter,

25
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,240
I want to handle it myself.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,159
This time,

27
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,400
I won't tolerate it anymore.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,680
Lin Han.

29
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,639
What are you trying to do?

30
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,599
I'm warning you,

31
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,639
don't come any closer.

32
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,000
If you dare touch me,

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,479
my parents won't let you get away with it.

34
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:57,879
What is it?

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,080
Are you scared already?

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,400
Su Mingyue

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
I'm not like you, Su Mingyue.

38
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,800
I will personally report this to the police and testify.

39
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,599
This won't end peacefully.

40
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,199
I told you,

41
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,560
if you mess with my child,

42
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,240
I will never let you off easily.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,560
So what if your parents are officials?

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,479
If necessary,

45
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,199
I'll even report your parents.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,280
She has no chance now.

47
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,719
I've hired the best lawyer.

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,800
You spread rumors and slandered before,

49
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,560
plus kidnapping and attempted murder.

50
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,439
You'd better reflect on your actions in prison.

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,479
Ying Huiming

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,039
Do you really think she's so innocent?

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,520
She's just after your money.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,599
That's right.

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,919
I, Ying Huiming, really have nothing else.

56
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,560
But I do have money.

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,840
As long as she wants it,

58
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,120
everything I have is hers.

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,160
Tell me,

60
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,959
do you think there's a next life?

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,000
People who couldn't be together

62
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,560
will meet again in another time and space.

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,040
To make up for regrets.

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,480
Why are you laughing?

65
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,720
I still think

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,240
all of this is a bit too perfect,

67
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,160
too unreal.

68
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,639
I meant every word I just said.

69
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,839
Can you give me a chance?

70
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't want to miss out on you.

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,639
Sorry, I still...

72
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,879
Sorry.

73
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,879
Lin Han.

74
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,000
Why does it suddenly appear in my mind...

75
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,480
The scene from my previous life's final moments suddenly resurfaces.

76
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,720
In my previous life...

77
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,199
Ladies and gentlemen,

78
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,439
let's welcome the arrival of the new millennium together!

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,319
I collapsed on the very last night of this year.

80
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:15,959
Nine.

81
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,120
Eight.

82
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,360
Seven.

83
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,399
Six.

84
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,600
Five.

85
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:21,839
Four.

86
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,839
Three.

87
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,720
Two.

88
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,639
One.

89
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
The year 2000 is here!

90
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,399
Happy New Year, everyone!

91
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,000
Although in this life,

92
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
fate has already changed,

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,279
Xiaowan can grow up safe and healthy,

94
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,839
but this life-and-death ordeal...

95
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,680
Can we really get through it safely?

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,720
Can I truly be at ease...

97
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,519
being with Huiming?

98
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:58,759
Sorry.

99
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,079
Sorry, let me help you pick that up.

100
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,319
It's you.

101
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,839
In the unseen forces of fate,

102
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,399
some disasters are hard to escape.

103
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,000
Right now, everything feels like an illusion.

104
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,360
New Year's Eve.

105
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Gala.

106
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,600
In the unseen forces of fate,

107
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,199
destiny is inescapable.

108
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,759
Everything before my eyes is just an illusion.

109
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,959
Destiny is inescapable.

110
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,240
So you're saying

111
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,079
I'll end up like in my previous life,

112
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
dying on New Year's Eve?

113
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,519
Sister Xiaolin,

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,519
you're amazing!

115
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
The clothes sold at the order fair are a hit all over the country.

116
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,839
Now our factory is truly famous.

117
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:06,720
Really?

118
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,160
Really.

119
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,759
Of course it's true.

120
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,319
Mom, if you don't believe me, look.

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,199
I'm telling you, Mom,

122
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,519
your reputation is really impressive now.

123
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,079
I'm planning to make you into a genius designer.

124
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,199
What do you think?

125
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,199
November 15th.

126
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,839
Only 45 days left until New Year's Eve.

127
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,360
When everyone is gathered around you,

128
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,000
what will that feel like?

129
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,120
It's pretty worth trying.

130
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,639
Mom

131
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,159
Mom

132
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,039
Mom

133
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,840
What are you thinking about?

134
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,360
You look so serious.

135
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,679
You didn't even hear me calling you.

136
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,080
It's nothing.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,399
I was just thinking how amazing our Xiaowan is.

138
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,679
You always have new ideas.

139
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,639
Go ahead.

140
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,360
If you have any ideas in the future,

141
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,480
I'll go with you.

142
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,279
Really?

143
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,120
Then get ready for my "Super Mom Plan."

144
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,639
First,

145
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,360
create a new trendy brand in China.

146
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,240
Second,

147
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,240
make the brand one of the top in the country.

148
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,159
turn you into a top designer in China.

149
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:17,559
Third,

150
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,000
get featured in major magazines.

151
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,720
make you the "Chanel of China."

152
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,960
Then start investing in real estate and stocks.

153
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,679
No matter if fate can be changed or not,

154
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,000
at least before I leave,

155
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,120
I want every day for Xiaowan

156
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,919
to be happy.

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,519
But that's not the most important thing.

158
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,159
The most important thing is to leave Xiangshui Village.

159
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,799
Head to the big city.

160
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,320
How about going to Shanghai?

161
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,240
Lin Han

162
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,200
I officially invite you and Xiaowan to come back to Shanghai with me.

163
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,360
We'll combine your influence

164
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,440
with the production strength of the clothing factory

165
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,080
to create a brand new fashion label.

166
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,360
Director Ying

167
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,200
I

168
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,360
I made this decision

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,840
not just because

170
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,519
I like you

171
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
but more because I recognize your abilities

172
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Go ahead, Mom

173
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:42,679
Mom

174
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,360
Go ahead

175
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,519
Let me tell you

176
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,759
Shanghai is a big city

177
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,200
If you go there

178
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,600
you'll definitely make a name for yourself

179
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,399
Trust me

180
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,000
In my previous life, I stayed in Xiangshui Town until I died

181
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,879
If I could leave this place

182
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,720
maybe I could change my fate

183
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Then is it possible

184
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,320
that I could stay with Xiaowan a little longer

185
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,399
Then

186
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,080
let's pack up

187
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,639
and set off right away

188
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,960
That's great

189
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,000
We're going to Shanghai

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,039
Going to Shanghai

191
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,600

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,000
Even if there's just a slight chance to spend more time with you

193
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,360
I'll do everything I can to seize it

194
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,639
I've never been on a plane before

195
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,399
I'm really looking forward to it

196
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,519
Where do you want to sit

197
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,919
See if you want to sit here

198
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,639
As long as I'm next to Mom, it's fine

199
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:57,919
Then here

200
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,279
Mom, you sit here

201
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,399
Uncle, you sit here
