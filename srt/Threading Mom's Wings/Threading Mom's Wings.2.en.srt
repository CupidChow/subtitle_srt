1
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,799
You wretched woman.

2
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,799
You made me lose face.

3
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
I've been too lenient with her.

4
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,840
Let me tell you,

5
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
she has to give you an explanation for this.

6
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,680
If she doesn't explain,

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,079
you should threaten her.

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,799
Tell her you'll divorce her.

9
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,680
She has a daughter, she wouldn't dare divorce you.

10
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,159
Do you understand?

11
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,879
No need to threaten.

12
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,840
We'll get divorced today.

13
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,239
I don't want any of the property.

14
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,560
I only want Xiaowan.

15
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,040
Lin Han.

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,159
Are you out of your mind?

17
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,159
Let me tell you,

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,400
A used woman who's already been married,

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,040
and comes with a child,

20
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:27,879
who would raise your kid for you?

21
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,599
That's none of your concern.

22
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,120
Let's sign the papers and get it done now.

23
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:32,439
Son

24
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:33,640
Come here

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:33,920
No need to say anything

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,239
Let Mom talk to you

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,680
You talk to her

28
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,000
Listen to me

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,640
No need to argue anymore

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,040
Go ahead and speak

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,319
Fine, I'll say it

32
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,560
You think I'm afraid of you?

33
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,319
Let me tell you

34
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,439
If you want a divorce, fine

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,560
Not a single cent you brought from your family

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,719
You are not allowed to take with you

37
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,159
And also

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,840
All these years

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,920
You spent from our family

40
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,079
Two thousand nine hundred

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,560
eighty yuan

42
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,319
sixty-seven cents

43
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:50,840
That's right

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,200
You have three days

45
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,040
to pay it all back

46
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,719
Otherwise, get out

47
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,200
Leave this girl with me

48
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Don't push us too far

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,200
Fine

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,799
Three days

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,560
My mom and I will pay off the debt

52
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:05,920
You

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,599
will divorce my mom

54
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,599
Divorce

55
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,319
Hello there.

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,159
Could you please wrap up these items in the middle for me?

57
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,159
Xiaowan.

58
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,759
Aren't we selling liquor?

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,280
Why are you buying clothes now?

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,319
We only have three days left.

61
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,400
Hurry up and get moving.

62
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,400
Don't worry, Mom.

63
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,919
One day is enough to sell the liquor.

64
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,199
But we need to be fully prepared.

65
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:30,560
Mom.

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,639
Clothes make the man, just like a saddle makes the horse.

67
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,039
If we want to sell our goods,

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
of course we need to create some buzz.

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,280
What kind of buzz?

70
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,080
Come and take a look!

71
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,280
Draw a lot to test your luck.

72
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,560
Consult the heavens above.

73
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,240
Ask about your future and relationships.

74
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,639
Anyone seeking a fortune reading,

75
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,280
can get a free cup of lucky liquor.

76
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,120
Buy a set of liquor,

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,439
and get a free fortune reading for your whole family.

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,800
Don't miss out as you pass by!

79
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,599
Consulting the oracle for answers

80
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,759
How do you know about this stuff?

81
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,960
Mom, do you believe me?

82
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Today is a lucky day for turning things around.

83
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,360
Uncles and aunts,

84
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,400
None of you have sold your cotton this year, right?

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,879
What's going on, Xiaowan?

86
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,520
Why did you call us here?

87
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,719
Do you have a solution?

88
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Can you help us sell it?

89
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,639
Yes.

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
Within an hour,

91
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,639
someone will come to help you solve this problem.

92
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,439
It's already the end of the year.

93
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,120
Who would come to buy cotton at this time?

94
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,840
Yeah.

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
Is she just making things up?

96
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
An hour?

97
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,520
Sounds like enough time to dream.

98
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,479
Where's the cotton buyer?

99
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,759
Of course they'll come.

100
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,560
But

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,360
there's still a bit of luck missing right now.

102
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:47,840
Mr. Ying

103
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,159
This is the place you mentioned in your pen pal letter.

104
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,240
But you haven't been in touch for years.

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
And you don't even know what she looks like.

106
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,000
Can you really find her?

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,120
As long as it's meant to be,

108
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,400
I believe

109
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,000
we will meet again.

110
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,919
How is that possible?

111
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,360
And what exactly is that opportunity?

112
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,520
Stop keeping us in suspense.

113
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,240
My mom is a blessed person.

114
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,080
As long as my mom dances to pray for blessings,

115
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,000
good fortune will come to us.

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,680
Xiaowan,

117
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,199
don't make fun of your mom.

118
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,920
She's been married into the village for so long,

119
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,720
and no one even knows she can dance.

120
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,279
That's right.

121
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,439
It's just dancing, isn't it?

122
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:25,800
Xiaowan,

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,560
play the music.

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,759
In my previous life,

125
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,800
I only learned after my mom left

126
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,199
that she could dance.

127
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,959
All those dreams she had as a young girl

128
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,079
were buried by the hardships of life.

129
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,560
The mom I remember

130
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,319
never seemed to smile this happily.

131
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,079
How wonderful.

132
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,040
In this life, I have a chance to start over.

133
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,480
To protect my mom's smile,

134
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,040
and let her shine.

135
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,000
My

136
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,399
mom.

137
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:41,879
He's here.

138
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,240
Only such an outstanding man is worthy of my mom.

139
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,040
I have a feeling.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,680
The person I'm looking for

141
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,199
is her.

142
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,120
Why?

143
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,079
I feel like I've seen her somewhere before.

144
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,240
Are you okay?

145
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,160
I'm fine.

146
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,439
Good fortune has arrived.

147
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,199
That's him.

148
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,839
He's the one buying cotton.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,279
He's really here to buy cotton.

150
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,199
Could it be that the little girl can really tell fortunes?

151
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,399
How about we wait a bit?

152
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,920
Let's buy two bottles of wine and try it ourselves.

153
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,800
How did you know?

154
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,240
I can't reveal the secret.

155
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,240
Look at my mom's clothes.

156
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,160
They're made from the cotton in our village.

157
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,560
This fabric

158
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,319
is both comfortable and beautiful.

159
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:20,839
I guarantee

160
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,759
if you use our cotton,

161
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,879
what you sell

162
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,399
will definitely sell quickly and well.

163
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:28,920
Sorry about that.

164
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,639
My daughter is just too excited.

165
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:31,759
But

166
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,319
we've all been looking forward to your arrival.

167
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,319
Daughter.

168
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
She's married.

169
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,319
Don't worry.

170
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,439
This time, I came

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,319
to solve the problem.

172
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,360
Everyone has

173
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,160
a lot of cotton they can't sell.

174
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,160
They're anxious.

175
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,399
As for me,

176
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,240
I'm here on behalf of the town's garment factory.

177
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,480
Raw materials are in short supply now.

178
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,519
However much cotton you have,

179
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,439
I'll buy all of it.

180
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,480
How is it, Mom?

181
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,199
I told you I wasn't lying.

182
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
There’s more fun to come in a bit.

183
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,319
So mischievous.

184
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,120
You figured it out again.

185
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,160
Now that's good.

186
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,319
We don’t have to worry about selling our wine anymore.

187
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,439
Mom, you go ahead and do business first.

188
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,959
You’re all too easy to fool.

189
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Jin Jie.

190
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,399
My dear aunt.

191
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,319
You finally came.

192
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,079
A new clothing factory just opened in town.

193
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,639
Needing cotton was only a matter of time, right?

194
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,439
But Xiaowan really predicted it.

195
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,200
She said someone would come to buy cotton within an hour.

196
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,120
Isn’t that amazing?

197
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,240
Sister-in-law.

198
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,279
It’s one thing for you to secretly sell our wine.

199
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,960
But now you’re even tricking and deceiving people.

200
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,600
Dressed up so flamboyantly.

201
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,639
I think you’re not selling wine.

202
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,840
You’re selling yourself, aren’t you?

203
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,039
Jin Jie.

204
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,279
Don’t make things up.

205
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,840
I’m making things up?

206
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,720
You’ve been married to my brother for so many years.

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,039
How come I never noticed you two had such abilities?

208
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,559
If you’re really that capable,

209
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,799
why couldn’t you have a son?

210
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,759
Instead, you gave birth to such an unlucky girl.

211
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,080
Ever since she was born,

212
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,720
nothing good has happened to our family.

213
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,639
Just looking at her makes me sick.

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,519
Aunt.

215
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,639
Do you dare let me tell your fortune?

216
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,440
Auntie

217
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,799
Do you dare to have your fortune told?

218
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,519
Sure, go ahead.

219
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,720
You think I’m scared of you?

220
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,559
Jin Jie

221
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,840
The show is about to start.

222
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,480
Auntie

223
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,879
You truly have a life destined for endless wealth.

224
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,039
You’re destined for fortune.

225
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,200
You naturally attract benefactors.

226
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,399
Go on.

227
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,399
Where is this benefactor?

228
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,919
This benefactor...

229
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,559
is your current manager.

230
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,879
But he has a wife and daughter.

231
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,600
You’re his mistress, being kept by him.

232
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,759
This is called

233
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,919
gaining wealth halfway but unable to keep it.

234
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,240
A disaster is about to befall you.

235
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

236
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,639
His name is

237
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
His name is, his name is...

238
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Huang Youcai

239
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,960
The person you’re looking for is here.

240
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,000
She’s the mistress.

241
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,480
Fortune telling and divination.

242
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,200
Luck-changing wine, 88 per bottle.

243
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,399
Ten bottles of lucky wine for only 888.

244
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,279
Includes a yearly fortune reading for the whole family.

245
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,960
If it’s not accurate, you don’t have to pay.

246
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,200
Alright, alright.

247
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,240
It’ll be ready soon.

248
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,759
Mom

249
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,159
After finishing this bottle, there’s another one.

250
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,360
Jin Jie

251
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,000
Last life, you hid at home and escaped disaster.

252
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,679
But you definitely won’t escape it this time.

253
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,480
So much money!

254
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,159
Mom, look!
