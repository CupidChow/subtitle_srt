00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,290
Well, Phai... I want to tell you that...

187
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,090
I want us to be together again.

188
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,370
You won't be able to accept my boundaries,
just like how you couldn't back then.

189
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,290
Why didn't you tell him the truth?

190
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,970
I told you that
I didn't want anyone to know.

191
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,330
If you're not okay with it,

192
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,820
let's break up.

193
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,660
Wait, Phai.

194
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,170
Can you please give me a chance?

195
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,330
But I have Chao now.

196
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,330
It's fine.

197
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,450
If you let me give you a ride,

198
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,770
I'm fine with that.

199
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,330
Mm.

200
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,450
See you tomorrow morning.

201
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,650
Yes.

202
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,870
I don't think...

203
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,180
I can handle this.

204
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,130
Come on, don't cry.

205
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,820
I'm not.

206
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,820
I was just rubbing my eyes.

207
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,300
You cried when you saw Phai get into his car.

208
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,460
Look at this.

209
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,900
[Sira: Getting back together?]

210
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,060
[Type: Sure.]

211
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,740
[Sira: Getting back together?
Type: Sure.]

212
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,100
What's wrong?

213
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,540
Is Type trying to take Phai from Chao?

214
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,960
Chao told me about it.

215
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,280
Yeah, why?

216
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,870
Type's made a post on Facebook
saying they're going back together.

217
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,440
That's why he's like this.

218
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,960
We should let the other side
be heard as well.

219
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,120
Well, yes.

220
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
But you're just his FWB.

221
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,720
But he let me be in his room.

222
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,240
Then, how do you know if Type's not...

223
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,720
I...

224
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,830
I'll ask Phai out.

225
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,130
How?

226
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,220
Hey,

227
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,180
constant dropping wears away the stone.

228
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,210
Chao.

229
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,510
If you're certain that
Phai is the one for you,

230
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,730
just tell him directly.

231
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,930
Trust me.

232
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,730
Jeez, Kao, why are you so hard-working?

233
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,820
You're the owner,
but you're cleaning the windows yourself?

234
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,010
Do I have to do it, too?

235
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,090
You don't.

236
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,110
There.

237
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,410
Someone's been waiting for you.

238
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,770
I'll go pack my stuff.

239
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,210
Okay.

240
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,090
Aren't you sick of waiting for me every day?

241
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,850
I'm not.

242
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,290
It's good that
I get to see your face all day.

243
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,010
Phai,

244
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,890
you're still as cute as you were before.

245
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,970
Jeez... Hey, walk nicely.

246
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,970
- Walk nicely.
- What?

247
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,370
- Walk nicely.
- Drunk?

248
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,690
I'm not drunk.

249
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,170
Who's drunk?

250
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,170
- We're not drunk!
- We're not drunk!!

251
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,290
Who's drunk? Not us!

252
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,050
Hey!

253
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,370
What?

254
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,220
You're the ghost girl in that room.

255
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,930
She's Nail's friend.

256
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,010
You just got off work?

257
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,300
Yeah.

258
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,420
How are you going to go home?
Look at you guys.

259
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,330
Hey, we're okay.

260
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,730
We can just get a cab.

261
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,290
We'll be home in a flash.

262
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,330
But...

263
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,770
I'll just go somewhere else.

264
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,170
Please take him.

265
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,290
Hey!

266
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,570
- See you.
- Hey!!

267
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,130
Come here!!

268
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,570
- Jeez!
- Let's go home.

269
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,810
You're drunk as a skunk and bothering me!

270
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,140
Should I just leave you here?!

271
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,730
Go! Slowly!

272
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,560
Hey, you!

273
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,120
Where's your keycard?

274
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,800
Wake up!

275
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,940
Come on!

276
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,320
Stay here.

277
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,530
Hey!

278
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,160
Are you dead?!

279
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,790
What did I do to deserve this?

280
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,870
[Chao: We were so drunk last night]

281
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,300
We really were.

282
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,050
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

283
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,520
Jeez, you scared me!

284
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,360
It's me who should be scared.

285
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,720
That hit hurt me.

286
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,320
I shouldn't have brought you here.

287
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,400
Well, you already have.

288
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,520
Anyway, thanks,
for letting me spend the night.

289
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,360
I think you lost your keycard.

290
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,320
I couldn't find it.

291
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,920
So, I should thank you more.

292
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,280
Yeah, I know.

293
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,960
If I hadn't run into you,

294
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,360
you would've been left on the road.

295
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,920
The porridge's ready.
You want some?

296
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,960
I do! You made it for me.

297
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,360
I made it for me.

298
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,580
Grab a serve if you want some.

299
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,780
Get a bowl over there.

300
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,180
[Nail]

301
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,540
Nail's calling me.

302
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,620
Don't say a word!

303
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,620
Hi, Nail.

304
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,220
Are you with Dream?

305
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,940
I'm not. How can I be with him?

306
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,980
I saw the pink pot I bought you
as your birthday gift

307
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,740
in Dream's Story.

308
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,260
Well...

309
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,360
there are so many pots like that one.

310
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,820
You're overthinking.

311
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,380
I'm all alone.

312
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,620
I see.
Turn on the camera, then.

313
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,700
I thought you were alone.

314
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,660
It was a coincidence.

315
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,900
What coincidence?
Spill the tea.

316
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,970
Well, I'll tell you later at the college.

317
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,450
I'll go now.

318
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,700
It's because of you!

319
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,970
Why did you post that Story?

320
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,370
How would I know?

321
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,890
Thank you for taking me here.

322
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,730
What more can I get
than the word 'thank you'?

323
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,490
What are you doing?

324
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,490
Pay attention in class.

325
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,010
I'll pick you up later.

326
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,210
Pay attention in class.

327
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,970
Behave well, too.

328
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,860
Got it!

329
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,450
I'll be your good boy.

330
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,090
- I'll go now.
- You'll be late.

331
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,290
Nail!

332
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,240
Did you send someone to hurt Nail?

333
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,860
I told you to deal with Him,

334
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,490
not to hurt Nail.

335
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,790
Why are you here?

336
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,010
I saw that bastard's Story.

337
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,310
Why the fuck did you do that?

338
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,390
Let's make a bet
if I'll get to score him.

339
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,840
If he messes with you again,

340
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,240
I'll go all out after him!

341
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,990
May I request injury time?

342
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,840
- Stop it, Him!
- Calm down!

343
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,980
Can I speak? They're filming.

344
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,100
ASMR?

345
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,580
What interview?

346
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,860
It was done.
I'm waiting for the next scene.

347
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,929
You want me to talk about scene 9/8?

348
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,340
I see. It's about...

349
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,139
There were Chao and Him.

350
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,260
It was like... Him...

351
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Him asked Phai
to help him reconcile with Nail,

352
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,220
but Phai wouldn't help.

353
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,220
Right. That was all.

354
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,420
- Wow!!
- Wow!

355
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,220
What's next?

356
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,740
♫Are poor people entitled to rights?♫
That's not it.

357
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:12,660
What EP are we shooting?

358
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,780
It's EP9.

359
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,810
No, it's not.

360
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,780
- It is?
- It is. That scene was in EP9.

361
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,460
It's EP9, right?

362
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,540
- Yes.
- Honey...

363
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,860
It's the first time Honey's here.

364
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,180
How was it?

365
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,420
It was fine.

366
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,780
- Fine?
- Fine??

367
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,780
- How was...
- It was fun for a bit.

368
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,820
How was swimming in the morning?

369
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,020
Was it cold? Or was it fun?

370
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,010
It was cold, but,
after getting out of the pool,

371
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,180
it was like in Norway.

372
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,020
It was like in Norway.
She was shivering.

373
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,980
I don't know how it's related to Norway.

374
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,420
Norway.

375
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,140
You three are playing something together?

376
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,260
We are.

377
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,100
Who's available?

378
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,700
Let's interview this guy first.

379
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,380
Come here, Fu.

380
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,540
- Have you interviewed him?
- Not yet.

381
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,260
Let me interview you.

382
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,860
He's going to be on the same trip with me.

383
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,780
I mean, we're leaving together.

384
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,300
- How was your scene?
- What time is it?

385
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,700
It's 10 P.M. now.

386
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,540
- It's a wrap.
- That's right.

387
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,780
Is it the first time
that it's done this early?

388
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,540
- Normally...
- I said it was 10 P.M.

389
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,820
10 P.M.!!

390
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,980
Yeah, it's 10 P.M.

391
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,060
Normally, they'll suddenly call Fu
to come in the middle of filming.

392
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,340
Right, but today...

393
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,420
Normally, I come the earliest,

394
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,860
but leave the last.

395
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,540
- You have to wait for others to finish.
- That's right.

396
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,900
He normally leaves with the team,

397
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,700
- but he'll leave early today.
- Right.

398
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,940
Finally.

399
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,980
He's been waiting for this day.

400
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,060
For this day?

401
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,100
Finally, I can leave early!

402
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,020
The three of us are leaving together.

403
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,000
We're waiting for Him to finish his talk.

404
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,740
Right.

405
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,980
Our main role has carried the set today.

406
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,260
Right.

407
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,300
Peet.

408
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,660
Look, here's our carry.

409
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,900
- Right.
- Peet,

410
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,900
- Please.
- All day!

411
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,060
- Literally.
- It's your role.

412
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,060
- Don't leave just yet. Stay with me.
- All day.

413
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,020
It's your day.

414
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,020
Alright, I see.

415
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,460
It's your day, not ours.

416
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,420
Stay here to support me.

417
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,660
I don't know how I can support you.

418
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,100
If I stay, I'll get to do it more.

419
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,220
Do what? A bonus scene?

420
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,420
Right, we'll have to play in more scenes.

421
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,460
But we're all here together today.

422
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,340
- We don't normally see you.
- Right.

423
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,300
But when you have to do it, there's a lot.

424
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,300
- Right.
- Peet wasn't ready for it.

425
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,580
He's been shooting all day.

426
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,820
- But he's all ready.
- I thought I'd have to shoot for 2 days.

427
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,900
I thought it'd be 2 days.

428
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,340
Like, the entire 2 days.

429
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,780
- Like, divide it into 2 days.
- That's right.

430
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,860
Let him rest.

431
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,710
One day is enough.

432
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,740
Let him rest. The weather's unstable.

433
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,700
- Right.
- Right.

434
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,060
Alright, we're...

435
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,420
Tong has gone to eat.

436
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,860
Right.

437
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,900
- Let's interview him next.
- He's here.

438
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,380
Until what time
did you practice last night?

439
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,020
Around 4 A.M.

440
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,060
- I see.
- Jeez, 4?

441
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,380
- At 4...
- You were practicing?

442
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,700
I was sleeping.

443
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,500
Just kidding.

444
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,060
It's another day that we started early.

445
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,540
However, we finished our scenes.

446
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,300
It's now his turn.

447
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,180
- My bro.
- Right.

448
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,540
Say something to our carry today.

449
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,700
Well, today...

450
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,380
I don't have any expectations.
Just do your best.

451
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,100
- No expectations?
- But if it doesn't turn out good...

452
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,980
- I mean, you're going to do well.
- If you do well,

453
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,100
you'll finish early.

454
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,020
But they might call us back

455
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,300
because they have nothing to film.

456
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,460
- Therefore, do it slowly.
- No, this location...

457
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,540
It's all done for this location.

458
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,300
- I see.
- All done.

459
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,220
- Okay.
- Right?

460
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,220
Don't give the game away.

461
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,820
I also want it to finish early

462
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,980
in case they'll call you guys back.

463
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,820
I see.

464
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,940
- Don't. Just...
- Go away.

465
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,020
Don't do it.

466
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,940
But it's so rare for Tor to leave early.

467
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,820
- That's right.
- Because...

468
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,660
Fu always gets to play
in only a few scenes.

469
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,540
- Right.
- A few scenes.

470
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,940
While sleeping, he'll be called.

471
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,740
- How was today?
- I always...

472
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,780
I always come first and leave last.

473
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,500
I heard that your dialogue was so long.

474
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,580
It was.

475
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,940
- I can tell by his voice.
- I didn't get to speak!

476
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,660
Right, it's coming...

477
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,580
- What's coming?
- The time I have to go to bed.

478
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,380
- You've been awake since the morning.
- You're ready to leave?

479
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,340
Right, I am.

480
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,660
Everyone looks so lively today.

481
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,620
Look, he's ready to leave.

482
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,220
- Alright.
- He's leaving now.

483
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,500
I'll give the mic to the staff.

484
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,860
Ready? 3, 2, 1, action!

485
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,060
Hi, you're watching For Him,

486
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,020
- EP9!
- 9!

487
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,940
Yay!!

488
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,820
Gosh.

489
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,380
- Why are we like this?
- Well...

490
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,940
We're here first, but we'll leave last.

491
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,460
- Right.
- It's been a long day.

492
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,900
What scene did we play in?

493
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,780
It was a party.

494
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,580
- Right.
- And we were returning home

495
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,940
while being drunk as a skunk.

496
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,980
You went there with your friend, but...

497
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,340
Can I say it?

498
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,540
But you left with...

499
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,180
Can I say it?

500
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,820
- Also a friend!
- You can...

501
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,100
- You're still friends?
- But...

502
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,460
Not the same friend.

503
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,100
- A new friend.
- A new one.

504
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,380
- He made a new friend.
- Right.

505
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,780
He was there with him,
but he left with her.

506
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,780
- Right.
- Right.

507
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,500
This guy left me.

508
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,660
Where did you go?

509
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,540
I just took a taxi home.

510
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,020
- Why did you leave your friend?
- I went home.

511
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,860
Well, I saw his new friend,

512
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,980
so I wanted him to go with her.

513
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,740
You just left us because we were together?

514
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,540
- Right.
- You wouldn't come to me?

515
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,580
I thought I could trust her.

516
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,340
And you're not worried about me at all?

517
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,940
He's gigantic.

518
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,220
I guess he'll become sober later.

519
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,500
Tell us how you feel about carrying Dream.

520
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,820
Actually, we've already filmed
the scene after this.

521
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,740
- Right.
- It was so exhausting

522
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,860
because no one could help me carry him.

523
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,900
I did it alone, and he's heavy.

524
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,900
Our sizes are completely different.

525
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,020
She was all alone.

526
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,060
It didn't take long,

527
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,060
but it was so exhausting.

528
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,940
It felt like I spent the whole day there.

529
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,860
Just one scene?

530
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,340
And he threw himself at me so hard.

531
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,900
- Hey...
- Right, I threw myself at her.

532
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,100
It'd look realistic.

533
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,260
Exactly.

534
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,300
If I hadn't done that,

535
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,650
it wouldn't have looked like I was drunk.

536
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,580
- Your expressions wouldn't be right.
- That's right!

537
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,940
- Just a little bit.
- It was so easy for him.

538
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,460
- He did nothing.
- Go see an orthopedist, too.

539
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,220
My arm was numb.

540
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,340
I didn't say a word.

541
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,020
- Right.
- I was just mumbling.

542
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,540
He cared about nothing.
He was completely drunk.

543
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,220
Are you good at it?

544
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,900
I'm not.

545
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,900
It was so hard for me.

546
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,420
- It's just...
- Being drunk?

547
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,820
- Right.
- It's hard.

548
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,340
To act like you're drunk
when you're not...

549
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,930
That's... That's hard to do.

550
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,580
But to pretend you're not drunk
when you are...

551
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,620
That's also hard.

552
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,500
But you did a good job.

553
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,580
Acting drunk?

554
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,460
That's right.

555
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,940
Did I look like I wasn't drunk?

556
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,580
You looked drunk.

557
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,220
Okay, the series is coming to an end.

558
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,620
- Right.
- It's coming to an end.

559
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,180
Tell them to watch the next EP.

560
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,420
The next EP?

561
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,260
- Stick around to watch it.
- For us?

562
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,780
It's gonna be fun!

563
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,780
- I mean, us.
- You'll get to see...

564
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,700
another side of us,

565
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,060
- which you've never seen.
- Right.

566
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,660
- You'll see it.
- In the next EP.

567
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,580
What about you?

568
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,820
- Cutie, lovely.
- Please root for us,

569
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,220
Chao and Phai.

570
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,500
Let's see if they're gonna meet.

571
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,540
Let's find out.

572
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,620
- Did he go to see you?
- Yes?

573
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,100
He came to see my dog.

574
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,980
- He was mad.
- Can I say it?

575
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,260
He was.

576
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:04,460
He's mad.

577
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,060
Yeah, I wanted to play with his dog.

578
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,180
You didn't want to see him?

579
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,460
No, his dog.

580
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,710
Alright, please check out
the next EP of For Him.

581
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,300
- Bye-bye.
- See you!

582
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,900
You sounded tired.
