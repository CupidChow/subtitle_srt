Fine! We're over.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,400
Why would someone do this to another?

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,000
If they broke up,

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,320
then who was that?

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,520
We're just having fun together.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,720
I found someone...

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,040
who could make me feel better!

11

70
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,240
you might believe in it again.

71
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,640

72
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,480

will you give it to me?

79

81
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,240

82
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,720
But it's Blue's birthday.
Why can't he make it?

83
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,680
It's what Blue wanted.

84
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,120
He might be with his mom.

85

but why can't he?

86

92

I don't.

93
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
I was just about to tease him

94

so that he could move on and be happy.

95
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,400

Let me start over with you tonight, Nail.

101
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,440
I'll make you feel like it's our first time.

102
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,280
Sure.

103
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,480
I'll make you forget everything.

104
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,400
I thought you were some kind of ghost.

105
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,480
If you saw a ghost,
then you're also a ghost.

106
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,000
You're messing with me?

107
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,080
Isn't it you who started it?

108
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,200
Isn't it you who always mess with me?

109
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,360
What did I do?

110
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,960
I saw that 1,000-Baht note with you.

111
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,760
I found it first!

112
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,400
- Is it yours?
- No.

113
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,600
But I found it first, so it's mine.

114
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,120
If it's not yours,
give it to the landlord and let her find the owner.

115
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,840
You can't simply claim it.

116
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Are you nuts?

117
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,800
How can you prove it's someone else's?

118
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,000
You're trying to claim it, huh?

119
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,800
Don't blame me for what you're trying to do.

120
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,720
Think about it.
If you lost your money, how would you feel?

121
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,960
Hey!

122
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,320
Give it to me. I found it first!

123
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,760
No!

124
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,280
I'll tell the landlord myself.

125
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,600
I don't trust you.

126
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,440
Give it to me!

127
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,560
I found it!

128
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,200
- It's mine!
- Go away.

129
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,120
- Let go!
- Give it to me!

130
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,560
It's mine!

131
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Give it to me!

132
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,440
Let go!

133
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,200
Jeez!

134
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,400
I'll go now.

135
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,840
It wastes my time talking to you.

136
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,760
Why are you following me?

137
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,280
What a narcissist you are.

138
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,520
Hi, ma'am.

139
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,400
What ma'am? Shut it.

140
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,360
I meant to say "girl."

141
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,400
Can I pay in installments this month?

142
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,360
I haven't gotten paid yet,

143
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,760
so I'd like to pay in installments as usual.

144
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,920
Honey, isn't this too little?

145
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,040
A thousand?

146
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,760
Once I get paid,

147
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,960
I'll pay it as soon as possible.

148
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,800
Please.

149
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160
Fine, then.

150
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,680
Someone found a banknote
in the hall last month,

151
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
but no one has claimed it yet.

152
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,760
I'll use it to cover your rent.

153
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,440
A 1000-Baht note from last month?

154
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,440
Right.

155
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,640
I haven't found the owner, though.

156
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,080
Think of it as if the owner's
helping you pay your rent.

157
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,640
Also, I know that you always keep your word

158
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,080
and never not pay your rent.

159
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,760
Thank you so much.

160
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,320
Once I get paid, I'll pay it for sure.

161
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,680
- Thank you.
- Sure, don't worry about it.

162
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,520
Thank you.

163
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,560
Hey, Nail.

164
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
It's been a while.

165
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,120
Hi, Phai.

166
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,480
Are you going to work?

167
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,320
Yeah. You?

168
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,560
That's a nice shirt.

169
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,480
Whose shirt is that?

170
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,640
I just got here.

171
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,120
I'll change my clothes

172
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,400
and go to the college.

173
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,880
Then, let's meet up and have a meal later?

174
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,760
I was about to say the same thing.

175
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,920
By the way, when are you free?
Let's have a meal together.

176
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,680
I'm fine with anything. You can decide.

177
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,760
Okay.

178
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,760
I want to talk about getting tattoos, too.

179
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,560
What? You want some now?

180
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,240
Aren't you afraid of needles now?

181
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,920
I am, but I want to overcome it.

182
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,360
I think it's best to...be yourself.

183
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,640
Thank you so much, Phai.

184
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,960
Whenever I talk to you,
it helps me feel better.

185
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,280
You don't need to thank me.

186
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
You're like my brother.

187
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,880
You really don't need to.

188
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,920
I do.

189
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,040
I really do have to thank you.

190
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,960
Last semester, without you,

191
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,800
my project wouldn't have succeeded.

192
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,400
Don't mention it.
It was just an interview.

193
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,680
Nail, I have to go now.

194
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,920
Kao's calling me.

195
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,920
- See you.
- See you!

196
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
- Get there safely.
- Okay.

197
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,080
Where were you on Blue's birthday?
Why weren't you there?

198
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,520
Guys, Van wants us to perform at the club tonight.

199
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,680
All members of the usual band
are having the runs.

200
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,280
At what time?

201
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,920
You have your report to finish.

202
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,760
An hour.

203
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,760
Wait. Two...
Just in case.

204
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,600
Speaking of the report, I'm sick of it.

205
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,320
You won't do anything, huh?

206
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,320
Are you guys...

207
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,800
...okay?

208
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,760
If you're okay, then I am.

209
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm okay with that, too.

210
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,560
Alright, meet me at my room at 6 P.M.

211
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,000
Finish our report first,
then we'll leave at 7 P.M.

212
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,000
Yes, sir! Let's go.

213
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,840
Okay?

214
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,440
We need to talk.

215
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,400
Are you enjoying it?

216
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,880
What's with you?

217
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,640
I already told you.
I don't want you to be happy.

218
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,520
Hey, Te.

219
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,520
What the fuck are you trying to do, Him?

220
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,440
Did you forget about that?

221
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,840
Stop it.

222
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,520
Don't ever mention it again.

223
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,840
Don't ever think you'll get to live a happy life.

224
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,480
You'll have to suffer like I do.

225
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,880
Stop!

226
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,960
Game on!

227
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,760
Let me see.

228
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,240
Whoa, hey!

229
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,120
Hi! What's your name?

230
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,680
I'm Phaploy.

231
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,480
Hello. I'm Ployli.

232
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,480
I'm Somsom, and this is Yihwa.

233
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,840
What? Som, why did you say that for me?

234
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,400
Well, is this your faculty?

235
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,720
You don't look familiar.

236
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,120
No, it's not my faculty.

237
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,800
Then, why are you here?

238
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,200
Are you searching for your love, aka me?

239
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,160
That's too much, girl!

240
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
That's not it.

241
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,080
I'm here to take Nail for a meal.

242
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,960
That's even more than too much.

243
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,520
Do you know Nail?

244
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,200
- Nail's taken him.
- What should we do?

245
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,400
He's here!

246
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,080
Nail's here. Please excuse me.

247
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,080
Look at him!

248
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,760
Have you been waiting for me long, Him?

249
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,800
Not at all.

250
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,440
Hey, are you guys having a meal together?

251
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,920
Right! Nail's about to have a meal with us.

252
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,880
So, can we just go together, or...

253
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,720
- Right?
- Yeah!

254
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,920
- You should come with us.
- Let's have a meal together.

255
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,160
Girls!

256
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,560
Don't be too obvious.

257
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,600
Come and have a lunch with me.

258
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,800
Isn't that too much, girl?

259
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Come here. Go.

260
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,920
Let's have some lunch.

261
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,360
- No!
- Come on.

262
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,600
Come on!

263
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,160
- I want to go with them!
- Stop it!

264
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,840
We can go together.

265
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,360
Why are you smiling?

266
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,520
It's because someone's being possessive.

267
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
You're cute.

268
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,880
Why would I be possessive of you?

269
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,640
We're not together.

270
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,400
Fine.

271
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,280
You're not being possessive, then,

272
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,280
Can you come to Flower Club with me tonight?

273
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,800
Why?

274
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,680
I'm performing tonight,

275
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,000
so I want you to come.

276
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,280
Will you?

277
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,480
Sure.

278
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,880
I'll take you home first,
then we'll go to the club later.

279
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,320
- Is that alright?
- Yeah.

280
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,000
Hi.

281
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,560
What's your name?
Can I have your contact?

282
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,320
Staring like that...

283
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,200
Wanna be mine?

284
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,240
I guess you didn't like that.

285
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,360
Then...
Do you have anything to carry home with?

286
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,240
Because I can be one.

287
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,080
Do you have no one to talk to, huh?

288
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,840
Of course not.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

289
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,280
Sure. Give me your phone.

290
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,920
Here.

291
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,600
[It's none of your business]

292
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,080
Jeez! I won't let you go next time!

293
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,440
Hi! We're Stay Four.

294
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,760
We hope you'll enjoy our show.

295
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,680
Who is your crush right now?

296
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,320
No matter who it is...

297
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,280
just tell them.

298
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,640
Don't play the fool.

299
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,680
Thank you, everyone.

300
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,240
Thank you. You can call us anytime.

301
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,200
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

302
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,760
Without you guys, I'd be in trouble.

303
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,320
- You should buy us some drinks, then.
- Sure!

304
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,200
Anything you want. Enjoy the night.

305
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,040
It's on me.

306
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,520
Van, I'll be right back.

307
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,840
What's with you?

308
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,520
What? Why are you making that face?

309
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm sick of this.

310
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,199
What is it?

311
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,920
He's not the left one,

312
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,440
or the middle one,

313
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,480
but he's the right one.

314
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,560
Shit...
What the fuck is wrong with you?

315
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,880
Pretty people are always mean.

316
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,920
Who is it?

317
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,679
Whatever. Leave it.

318
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,480
Where did Te and Him go?

319
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,480
I don't know.

320
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,080
Him said he'd leave early,

321
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,800
so Te followed him.

322
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,760
Who were you looking at?

323
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,280
"Pretty people are always mean," right?

324
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,560
I don't want to leave you yet.

325
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,720
Can I still be with you?

326
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,880
Some breaks would be nice.

327
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,680
Anyway, you looked cool performing on stage.

328
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,480
And did you like it?

329
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,960
You're always flirting with me.

330
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,760
It might change your mind.

331
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,480
Let's change the topic.

332
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,360
Anyway, when did you learn to play bass?

333
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,360
Since high school.

334
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,600
Really? That's cool.

335
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,120
Does that mean...
lots of people have tried to flirt with you?

336
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,760
No, I was taken.

337
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,200
What? Why did you stop?

338
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,760
Keep going.

339
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,560
It's getting dark.

340
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,920
You should get some rest.

341
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,520
Or...

342
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,680
do you want me to stay?

343
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,160
No, you should leave.

344
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,840
I want some rest now.

345
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,520
Can I pick you up tomorrow?

346
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,000
Let me think about it first.

347
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,200
Then, once I reach home,
can I call you?

348
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,760
Mm.

349
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
I'll go now.

350
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,240
Okay.

351
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,080
- Bye-bye.
- Goodnight.

352
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,480
- You're so fucking heavy.
- Keep walking.

353
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,120
- Keep walking.
- The driver's been here for ages.

354
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,160
- You're talking too much.
- Text me when you're home. See you, Kao.

355
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,520
I carried your ass and said nothing, damn.

356
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,760
Why don't you open the door?

357
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,720
Easy, man.

358
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,040
You can go now, sir.

359
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,080
Wait, you won't come with me?

360
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,280
Are you okay? Are you drunk?

361
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm not drunk.

362
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,320
I said I wouldn't let you go
if I met you again.

363
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,320
Can I have your contact?

364
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,480
Stop saying your cheesy pick-up lines.

365
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,560
If you don't like them,
I can do other things.

366
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,480
Are you sure you want it?

367
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,440
I am sure I want it.

368
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,080
[Mom: Don't forget to keep up with
your doctor's appointments]

369
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:06,320
[Mom: Don't forget to keep up with
your doctor's appointments]

370
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,720
[Okay]

371
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,880
[Te: Who did you leave with, Him?]

372
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,920
- Hello?
- Hello.

373
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,200
Have you gone to bed?

374
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,680
Not yet.

375
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,680
So, you can talk to me
before going to bed, right?

376
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,880
Yeah. Sure.

377
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,480
I'll tell you when I'm sleepy.

378
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,160
Okay. Tell me if you are.

379
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,640
Mm.

380
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,440
Come in.

381
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,400
Tonight, can I...

382
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,840
If you want me, come and follow me.

383
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,800
Tonight, can I feel you?

384
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,320
Be gentle. That's all I want.

385
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,240
As you wish.

386
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,800
Can you...turn your camera on?

387
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Sure.

388
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,240
Do you realize how adorable you are?

389
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,400
What adorable?

390
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,240
Are you on a balcony?

391
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,320
That's right.

392
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,920
It's got great views.

393
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,240
Right?

394
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:21,040
Should we try...having fun here later?

395
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,960
You're good at mentioning it.

396
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,480
I'll take that as a compliment.

397
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,240
I'm asking for your permission, then.

398
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:46,280
Nail, I don't want to be someone
you're just having fun with.

399
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,760
- Can we change our relationship...
- I think...

400
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,640
...it's better that we are like this.

401
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,040
You know, we're just having fun together.

402
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,560
I'm sleepy.

403
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,880
Okay. I understand you.

404
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,200
Don't worry about it. Goodnight.

405
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,560
[Nail: I don't want to lead anyone on]

406
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,880
[Nail: Please understand me]

407
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,960
[Blue: I miss you]

408
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,080
You've never said you missed me.

409
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,800
We're together, aren't we?

410
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,160
Why don't you have time for me?

411
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,680
Blue,

412
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,920
you know I'm busy with my family matters.

413
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,200
Why don't you understand me?

414
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,480
You always say that.

415
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,480
Do I not matter to you at all?

416
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,080
You're my best friend, Te.

417
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,160
This is Nail.

418
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,280
Nail?

419
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,000
We're friends.

420
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,080
Is this how you wanted to start over?

421
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,160
What are you doing?

422
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,400
Making you realize.

423
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,040
You know what? You're my type.

424
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,400
Stay away from him. He's mine.
