Why do you keep stalking Nail?

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,960
What are you trying to do?!

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,960
- Answer me!
- I didn't do anything.

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,079
Is that the one who hurt you?

Yeah,

what are you doing with my friend?

Stop it, Type.

It's you who has to stop.

16

to stay at the hospital, but you wouldn't.

I mean, your wound.

39
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,640
It's just a small wound.

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
I'll be fine.

41

I'm sorry...

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,960
for everything.

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,560
All I did was be mad at you,

49
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,760
and it ruined everything.

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,280
I won't forgive you.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,520
I'm sorry, too.

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
I want to hate you so fucking bad,

53

but I can't.

54
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,000
About Nail, it's not over yet between us.

55
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,040
I mean, I haven't said sorry to both of you.

56
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,880
You mother...

57
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,320
It's true that I approached Nail
because he looked like Blue.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,400
Actually, I don't like him.

59
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,800
I was just mad at you.

60
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
I didn't want you to be in a good relationship.

61
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,600
You can be stuck in the past.

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,040

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,440

May this be the last time

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,000
you have to say sorry to me.

66

67
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,960
let's be friends again like we were, Te.

68
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,120
I thought you wouldn't want
to be friends with me anymore.

69
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,920
Thank you.

70
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,400
Right. About Type, he got arrested.

71
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
He's gonna spend a long time in prison.

72
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Mm.

73
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,280
So, I'll go talk to Nail.

74
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,080
Nail, I'm sorry.

75
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry for everything
in which you were involved.

76
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,080
I'm really sorry.

77
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,960
I know that, actually, you're not a bad person.

78
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,320
Let the past...teach you lessons.

79
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,280
From now on, live a good life.

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,360

81
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,720

82
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,160

If I suggest something,

186
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,480
will you give it a try?

187
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,720
What is it?

188
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,920
Try disappearing from his life.

189
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,200
I can't do that.

190
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,440
You can.

191
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Trust me.

192
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,080
If you disappear from his life

193
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,240
and let him miss you,

194
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,520
he'll give in in no time.

195
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,320
Really?

196
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,960
I have nothing to lose. Let's do it.

197
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,720
Alright, you can do it.

198
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,720
Your references are pretty,

199
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
but I'll add some designs to it.

200
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,360
Like, colors and elements...

201
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,360
That'd be nice.

202
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,000
Chao... Chao!

203
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,000
- Chao!
- Yes?

204
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,000
Were you listening to me?

205
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,400
What did you say?

206
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
Hey, if you're arguing,

207
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,480
why don't you talk things out?

208
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,360
Why are you ignoring each other?

209
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Phai doesn't seem like he's missed me.

210
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,320
Jeez, I knew that was coming.

211
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,880
Don't you think
what I've been doing is obvious enough

212
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,440
to show him how I feel?

213
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,160
I'm just an outsider.

214
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,320
The person you should be talking to is Phai.

215
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,560
So, you'll get this one, right?

216
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,640
I'll print it out.

217
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,320
If you want to tattoo him, do so.

218
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,360
You guys are such...

219
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,040
But he doesn't want to see me.

220
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,560
Are you blind?

221
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,880
He's head over heels in love with you.

222
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,800
Honestly,

223
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,000
you should talk things out.

224
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,600
The tattooing?

225
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
Tell him I don't want to do it.

226
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,640
Just add more designs to it for him.

227
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,400
Tattoo him, too.

228
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,920
Hey, Phai.

229
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,840
Do whatever you want.

230
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,320
Care about someone you should.

231
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,400
I'll go now.

232
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,800
- I'll leave.
- Okay.

233
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,240
- Goobye, Kao.
- Goodbye.

234
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,960
Kao asked me to tell you he's sorry.

235
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,680
He's not going to tattoo you anymore.

236
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,520
What? He just ditched me?

237
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,760
If you still want it, I'll do it for you.

238
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,760
You want to do it for me?

239
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
"I am your Chao."

240
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,280
Here's my new design.

241
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,440
Chao,

242
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,720
about being your boyfriend,
can we not hurry?

243
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm scared I'll get hurt.

244
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
I understand you,

245
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,160
but I don't like it

246
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,040
when you keep saying
I don't have the right to be jealous of you.

247
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,160
I don't like it
when you keep repeating our fragile status.

248
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,240
So,

249
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,520
that's why I want to be your boyfriend.

250
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,600
I'll prove it to you

251
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,000
and show you that I love you

252
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,280
and that I won't hurt you.

253
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,680
Mm, let's give it a try, then.

254
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,600
Where do you want to get this tattooed?

255
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,520
On the back of my elbow.

256
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,560
Okay, lie on your front.

257
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,880
Did I lose it?

258
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,760
It's lost!

259
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,120
Shit.

260
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,000
[Piece: Mesa, are you coming to the dorm today?]

261
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,720
[Mesa No, I'll go there tomorrow]

262
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,320
[Cream: Me, too]

263
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,800
Where will I spend tonight?

264
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,160
Hello, Mom.

265
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
We have arrived in Chiang Mai.

266
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,360
Okay. Are you at the hotel?

267
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,040
Yes, we're about to arrive.

268
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,600
Are you at home yet?

269
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,760
I'm about to reach home,

270
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,040
but I can't get inside...

271
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,320
Without your dad and me,

272
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,080
tell Te and his mom if you need anything.

273
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,360
Okay.

274
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,320
Alright, take care of yourself.

275
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,640
I'll go now.

276
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,560
Okay.

277
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,240
I'm fucking doomed.

278
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,640
- You can't enter your house?
- Shit!!

279
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,400
- Te!
- Were you about to punch me?

280
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,480
You came out of nowhere.

281
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,000
So, you can't enter the house?

282
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,120
Let's spend the night at my house.

283
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,480
Will you do it here, then?

284
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,480
Come on!

285
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,080
Hey, Te!!

286
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,200
Why don't you share the bed with me?

287
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,280
Well, I don't want to bother you.

288
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Where will you sleep?

289
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,480
In the bed.

290
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,760
I'll sleep on the floor, then.

291
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,320
Why? Are you scared of something?

292
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,200
No, I'm not.

293
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,920
Oh, yeah?

294
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,560
Then, why don't you share the bed with me?

295
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,240
I don't want to bother you.

296
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Oh, yeah?

297
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Aren't you afraid that your heart will beat too fast

298
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,040
if you share the bed with me?

299
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,080
I'm not into you anymore.

300
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,400
Really?

301
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,840
It seems like you still are.

302
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,520
I am not!!

303
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,760
It's fine if you're not.

304
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,320
What are you shouting for?

305
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,680
Te,

306
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,320
I have something to ask you.

307
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,360
I'll answer if I can.

308
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,840
Why did you cry?

309
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,480
Was it about that friend of yours?

310
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,920
No.

311
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,360
Well, I did something bad to my friends.

312
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,680
I already told them I was sorry,

313
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,800
but I still felt guilty.

314
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,320
If you already apologized,
why would you still be guilty?

315
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,880
Let the past be the past.

316
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,240
Life is short.

317
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,640
Just you want you're happy to do.

318
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,120
Go to bed, kiddo.

319
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,960
Who's a kiddo?

320
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,480
Do you have class tomorrow?

321
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,720
Then, I'll give you a ride.

322
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,000
Go away!

323
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,320
Are you alone?

324
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,120
Te!

325
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,600
Are you here to watch a movie alone?

326
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,160
No, I'm with my friends.

327
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,120
They're in the toilet.

328
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,360
Why didn't you tell me

329
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,040
so that I'd pick you up?

330
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,560
It's fine. I don't want to bother you.

331
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,840
For you,

332
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,160
I'm willing to do it.

333
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,600
If you're not into me, don't get my hopes up.

334
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm not.

335
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,200
I just want to open up to you.

336
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,520
What?

337
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
Wait. Where are you going?

338
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,040
I'll use the toilet.

339
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,360
It's right here.

340
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,080
Nail, I have something for you.

341
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,160
Something?

342
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,760
- What is it?
- Your hand, please.

343
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,960
When I asked you to be my boyfriend,

344
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,360
I didn't give you anything.

345
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,280
Please let this ring
serve as a symbol that you are mine.

346
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,080
Thank you.

347
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,840
Thank you for this lovely ring,

348
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,320
and for helping me with my work.

349
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
You don't need to.

350
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,320
I'm willing to help my boyfriend.

351
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,080
It's for my boyfriend.

352
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,200
Then,

353
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,160
should I reward you with something, too?

354
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,160
Wait.

355
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,200
If you're getting any reward,

356
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,520
it should be something...

357
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,000
fragrant.

358
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,680
It is fragrant.

359
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,720
That smells good, too.

360
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,760
- Are you done?
- Mm.

361
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,800
Are you tired?

362
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,199
I'm so lucky

363
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,920
to meet you.

364
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,920
It's me who feels luckier to meet you.

365
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,320
Don't you want to know

366
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,159
if I love you or not?

367
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,440
You've never asked.

368
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
I want you to say it yourself.

369
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,800
I can wait.

370
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,920
Then,

371
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
I love you, Him.

372
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I love you, too, Nail.

373
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,520
You know what? After you said that,

374
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,080
all of me...has become all yours.

375
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,160
How can I believe that?

376
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,200
Well,

377
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,080
I have to prove it.

378
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,720
I love you, Nail.

379
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,840
I love you, too, Him.

380
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
I love you more.

381
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,240
I love you, too.

382
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,040
But I love you more.

383
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,080
- You can't enter your house?
- Shit!

384
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,680
Te?!

385
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,520
You don't have to curse at me!

386
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,320
You came out of nowhere.

387
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,400
So, you can't enter the house?

388
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,800
Wanna spend the night at my house?

389
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,600
"Let's spend the night at my house."

390
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,000
Point your finger there.

391
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,000
After that, go that way.

392
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,720
- "At my house."
- Yes.

393
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
Let's spend the night at my house.

394
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,880
That would be out of the frame.

395
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,920
Ready?

396
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,960
Ready.

397
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,240
Rolling!

398
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,920
Go!

399
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,720
- Go.
- Get set!

400
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,280
And...
Action!

401
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,280
I'm fucking doomed.

402
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,520
- You can't enter your house?
- Shit!

403
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,320
There's an airplane flying above us.

404
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,720
What is this?

405
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,320
This is ridiculous!

406
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,920
- Ready?
- Set.

407
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
And...

408
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,840
Action!

409
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,960
You can't enter your house?

410
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,320
No yet.

411
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,000
It's "I'm fucking doomed!"

412
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,360
Okay, let's try that again!

413
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
- Return to your position.
- Again!

414
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,400
Walk back.

415
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,080
Set and...

416
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,680
Action!

417
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,040
- You can't enter your house?
- Shit!!

418
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,920
- Te!
- Were you about to punch me?

419
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,480
So, you can't enter the house?

420
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,760
Pointing like that means that's your house.

421
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
- I'm fucking doomed...
- Set...

422
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,320
- Set!
- Okay.

423
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
And action!

424
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,760
I'm fucking doomed.

425
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,800
- You can't enter your house?
- Shit!!

426
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,640
- Te!
- Were you about to punch me?

427
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,720
You came out of nowhere.

428
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,560
So, you can't enter the house?

429
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,240
Let's spend the night at my house.

430
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,760
Will you do it here, then?

431
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,600
Come on!

432
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,560
Well done!

433
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,240
Why don't you share the bed with me?

434
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,760
Well, I don't want to bother you.

435
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,920
Not yet.
He has to ask you this first...

436
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,240
"Aren't you afraid that your heart will beat too fast

437
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,520
if you share the bed with me?"

438
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,720
After this, show him that you aren't afraid of him.

439
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,280
Jomtup, tell us how you feel
about going on set with Fu again.

440
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,520
How do you feel?

441
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,520
We got to do a big scene today.

442
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,600
It was the first scene.

443
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,560
I was also the first one
to get to do the makeup.

444
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,480
It was great.

445
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,160
I'd never thought I'd be the first one.

446
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,840
You were the first
to get to do everything today,

447
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,520
- doing the first scene of the day,
- Yes.

448
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,080
and getting the makeup done, right?

449
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,120
- Yes.
- Ah...

450
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,880
How did it go?

451
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,240
This is not your first time
coming to this set, right?

452
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,160
It's your second time.

453
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,560
- Ah, yes.
- See?

454
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,960
This was my second time,
and I thought I had to do one shoot.

455
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,440
- There was a bit of a misunderstanding.
- Yeah, there was.

456
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,320
I thought I only had to do one.

457
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,080
So I told everybody
that I only had to do a shoot today.

458
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,920
But actually...
Let me correct myself.

459
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,040
- I have to be on set twice today.
- Ah, twice.

460
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
- You'll be in several EPs, right?
- Yes.

461
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,680
What about you? Fu?
How did you feel about being on set

462
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,960
with him for the first scene?

463
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,000
It was exciting.

464
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,160
How do I explain this?

465
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,000
I haven't been on set for a long while, right?

466
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,520
So it was pretty exciting.

467
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,120
I'd rarely seen him, like only once.

468
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,880
- Ah.
- And I got to see him again today

469
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,320
- on the set.
- Yes, on the set...

470
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,720
What Fu was trying to say is that...

471
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,400
It's not that he got excited being on set,

472
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,640
but it's because he got to work with you.

473
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,120
Yes, I'm excited working with you.

474
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,440
How sweet.

475
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,240
Please check out
EP. 11 and 12 of For Him, guys.

476
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,200
Also, please root for us.

477
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,000
- This is...Te.
- Te.

478
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,560
Te and who?

479
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,280
- Te and Piece.
- You got your character name right.

480
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,600
We're now in the homestretch, right?

481
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,160
Please check it out, guys.

482
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,320
I don't know how this would end.

483
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,480
Every EP from here on out will be surprising.

484
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,480
Stay tuned, guys.

485
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,200
I'll give you a ride.

486
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,960
Okay.

487
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,560
Are you sure you're going to flirt with me?

488
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,200
I've been sure for a while.

489
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,760
Nail,

490
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,280
I have a surprise for you tonight.

491
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,640
You may open your eyes.

492
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,280
Here's to celebrate
the four-month anniversary of our first meeting.

493
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,720
From now on, I promise

494
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,880
that I'll take care of you

495
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,960
and not hurt you ever again.
