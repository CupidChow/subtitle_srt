00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,800
I don't think Him's ready, though.

186
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,440
I don't want him to hurt anyone.

187
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,120
He'll be the one who gets hurt.

188
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,200
Will Nail do the modeling with me?

189
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,840
Not really sure.

190
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,360
But trust me.

191
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,840
I'll have to go now.

192
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Text me if there's anything.

193
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,240
Okay, Type.

194
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,160
It's my turn now, Him.

195
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:17,480
[Yihwa: Do you know Blue?
Why don't you answer?]

196
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,400
[Nail: I do. Why?]

197
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,680
[Yihwa: Finally! Thought you blocked me]

198
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
[Nail: Sorry, I was busy]

199
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,000
[Yihwa: You do know him?]

200
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,280
[Nail: It's Him's ex]

201
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,200
[Yihwa: You've seen his face,
haven't you?]

202
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,480
[Yihwa: Aren't you shocked?]

203
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,080
[Nail: Why would I?]

204
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,080
[Nail: I've never seen his face.
What's wrong?]

205
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,920
[Yihwa: Sent a picture.
You look identical]

206
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,680
[Yihwa:
He probably goes to this college, too]

207
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,240
Blue!

208
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,440
Him! What are you doing?

209
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,319
Why are you taking photos here alone?

210
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,720
I'm wearing the shirt you bought me.

211
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,800
How do I look?

212
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,960
Pay attention to what I said!

213
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,920
- Okay, then.
- Do I look cute?

214
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,200
Let me see.

215
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,400
Whoa, it's so pretty.

216
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,280
Then, let's take some photos.

217
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,680
Sure.

218
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,720
You're here?

219
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,040
Here. Have some.
I made it for you.

220
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,280
Thanks.

221
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,800
Whoa, it's good.

222
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
You won't have it?

223
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,400
I've already had it.

224
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
- Dessert?
- Sure.

225
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,360
Let me feed you.

226
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,240
Ahhh...

227
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,800
What are you doing?

228
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,080
- Is it good?
- It is.

229
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,520
This has sat here for 3 days.

230
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,640
Just kidding.

231
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
Let me feed you now.

232
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,880
Sure.

233
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,160
How is it?

234
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,280
What a big bite.

235
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,320
I like that we're here together.

236
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,160
I want to be with you like this forever.

237
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,200
Me too.

238
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,120
It's almost 8 A.M. now.

239
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,400
I'll be late.

240
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,040
Easy.

241
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,440
I'll take you there first,

242
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,560
okay?

243
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,040
Sorry, I was panicking.

244
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,160
It's alright.

245
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,600
Check your stuff.
You might miss something.

246
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,920
I don't think so. It's all here.

247
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm ready.

248
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,560
Okay. Let's go.

249
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,880
Let's go.

250
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
The vibe's so good in here.

251
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,240
Do you like it?

252
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,960
A lot.

253
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,640
Come on.

254
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,680
Please have a seat.

255
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,080
Thank you.

256
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,240
Blue,

257
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,160
happy second anniversary.

258
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,240
Him...

259
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm about to cry.

260
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,520
Thank you so much.

261
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,000
Thanks.

262
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
It looks so good.

263
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,800
I ordered all of your favorite dishes.

264
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,880
Eat up.

265
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,200
You're very good.

266
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,800
You can remember all of my favorite dishes.

267
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,840
Of course.

268
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,160
You're my lover

269
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,880
and my special person.

270
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,560
I love you, Him.

271
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,080
I love you the most, Blue.

272
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,960
Thank you, Him.

273
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,240
No problem. Let's dig in.

274
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I couldn't focus.

275
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,480
- Just try to concentrate, then.
- The exams are coming.

276
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,560
Hey, I'll pick Blue up.

277
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,800
- Okay.
- You're heading home?

278
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,440
- Right, I am.
- Okay.

279
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,360
Get home safe.

280
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,240
Hello?

281
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,320
Hello, are you a relative of
Mrs. Walaiporn Panumesthanan?

282
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,120
Yes, I'm her son.

283
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,800
Mrs. Walaiporn got into an accident
and is now at the hospital.

284
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,080
What? What did you say?

285
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,960
Can you come visit the patient?

286
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,680
Yes, I'll be there now.

287
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,360
[Him (13)]

288
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,800
Hello?

289
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,480
Hello, Te.

290
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,360
Am I bothering you?

291
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,400
Are you free to talk?

292
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,640
I am. What's wrong?

293
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,000
Do you know if Him's okay?

294
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,200
I can't contact him.

295
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,720
He's...busy.

296
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,680
His mom got into an accident,
so he went to the hospital.

297
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,600
What? Is his mom okay?

298
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,600
I don't know.

299
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,000
Do you want to talk to Him?

300
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,120
Can I?

301
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,200
Yes, hold on.

302
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,120
Blue called.

303
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,400
- Hello.
- Hello, Him.

304
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,240
Is your mom...okay?

305
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,600
Do you want me to come?

306
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,880
You can go home.

307
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,480
You don't have to come.
It's nothing.

308
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,520
Should I?

309
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,360
Yeah, get home safe.

310
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,560
Your home's pretty far.

311
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,360
Do you always go home alone?
The road's not well-lit.

312
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,400
No.

313
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
Your skin's so nice.

314
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,240
Well, how about this?

315
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,120
If you don't mind,
I'll take you home every day.

316
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,880
It's fine.

317
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,840
You can pull over.

318
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,120
I'll get off here.

319
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,440
Come on. Don't leave just yet.

320
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,800
It's not your home.

321
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,120
I'll take you home, okay?

322
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,680
If you don't stop,
I'll call the police.

323
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,120
Jeez.

324
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,560
You're so mean.

325
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,880
I'm wondering...
if you're also mean in bed.

326
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,080
I'm calling the police.

327
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,880
Hey, wait!

328
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,040
Fine. I'll stop right here.

329
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,560
Get off here.

330
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,120
You're playing so hard to get.

331
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,440
I've met someone prettier than you!

332
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,080
Te!

333
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,800
Blue!

334
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,720
Didn't Him join the class?

335
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,360
He didn't.

336
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,520
He's taking care of his mom
at the hospital.

337
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,200
You still can't contact him?

338
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,680
Yeah.

339
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,520
He won't pick up my calls.

340
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,440
He's busy, I guess.

341
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
What about his house?

342
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,320
Right, you should go to his house.

343
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,080
Okay. Thank you.

344
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,320
Hello?

345
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,360
Hello, Him.

346
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,720
Blue, I have to take care of my mom.

347
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,560
Talk to you later.

348
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,280
Hey, Blue!

349
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,640
You're looking for Him?

350
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Hi.

351
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,960
He's not here.

352
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,560
He's taking care of his mom
at the hospital.

353
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,360
That's what you always say.

354
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,240
Do I not matter to you at all?

355
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,960
[Blue: How are you?]

356
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I know that...

357
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,520
you have work to do,

358
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
but I still feel slighted.

359
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,480
Will you know what I've been through?

360
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,000
Are you...bored of me now?

361
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,240
Hello, where are you?

362
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,480
Hello, Te.

363
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,400
Have you met Him?

364
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,880
Where are you?

365
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,840
I'll take you to Him.

366
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,880
I'm at the Faculty of Laws building.

367
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,680
Okay. I'll be there soon.
Wait for me.

368
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,480
Thank you, Te.

369
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,000
Welcome.

370
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,040
Take care of her.

371
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,080
- Mr. Him.
- Yes?

372
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,320
Please check the grocery list.

373
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,960
I think we need to restock this

374
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,520
- because there are lots of customers.
- Okay.

375
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,200
- And...
- That's him.

376
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,200
- Go in.
- So, we should restock this one.

377
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,360
- Sure.
- Thanks, Te.

378
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,480
- Come on.
- And please carefully check it again.

379
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,560
This is a new brand, you know.

380
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,400
- Sure.
- Alright.

381
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,679
Okay...

382
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,920
I'll discuss it with you later.

383
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,760
Okay.

384
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,320
Why are you here?

385
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,159
I'm here to see you.

386
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,840
I'm busy.

387
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
You should leave.

388
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,800
I'll come to you when I'm free.

389
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,960
When is that?

390
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,639
Can you not cry?

391
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,719
I'm very busy.

392
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,159
Can you leave?

393
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,280
No.

394
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,679
I miss you.

395
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,360
A lot.

396
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,720
If I didn't come,

397
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,920
we wouldn't have met.

398
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,320
Don't be silly.

399
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,600
You know I'm busy.

400
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,120
Just leave. Please.

401
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Wait. Take it easy.

402
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,200
You took him here.
Now, take him back.

403
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,840
Why did you do that to Blue?

404
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,680
You want to do this, huh?

405
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,880
From now on, I'll take care of Blue.

406
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,440
Let's leave.

407
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,120
It's true that I approached him
because he looked like Blue.

408
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,320
I don't want to deal
with you guys anymore.

409
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,920
And you're hating me, too?

410
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,560
If there's anything on your mind,
you can tell me.

411
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,480
Just follow your heart.

412
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,640
Hi! It's me, Yeen.

413
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,840
So, today is...

414
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,280
an auspicious day

415
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,680
for Y.entertainment

416
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,520
as we are...

417
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,560
on set filming the series For Him.

418
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,240
Today...

419
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,800
For today's interview,

420
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,800
let's see who will be on set

421
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,480
and who we will get to interview first.

422
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,600
Please stay tuned, guys.

423
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,800
They're doing their first scene of the day.

424
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,280
If you take a look to your left...

425
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,640
Pan the camera, please.

426
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,640
Ah, see?

427
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,920
I can only show you a sneak peek.

428
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,720
When they're done,
we'll interview the first actor we see.

429
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,600
Let's see who it's gonna be.

430
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Stay tuned!

431
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,720
See you in a minute.

432
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,600
I dyed my hair a different color.

433
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,280
It was black in the morning,
now it's blonde again.

434
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,880
I'm like a shape-shifter.

435
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,320
True.

436
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,800
He plays so many characters.

437
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,480
I'm constantly changing this and that.

438
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,000
My shooting schedule is
from morning to late night.

439
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,760
I'll be in every scene today.
It's like I'm the main character or something.

440
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,040
Cut me some slack!

441
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Right, I'm the protagonist.

442
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,440
Is it tiring to have to constantly dye your hair?

443
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,880
No, I like it. But...

444
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,640
Today,

445
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,320
they took me to a hair salon.

446
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,240
I fell asleep during my session.

447
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,640
You didn't go to that salon, did you?

448
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
We didn't go there.

449
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,600
We're not sponsored.

450
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,280
He went to a hair salon, guys.

451
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,040
I was dozing off.

452
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,000
Let's see how the 4 girls are doing today.

453
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,760
I guess today is gonna be a chaotic one.

454
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
There are so many cast members here today.

455
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,080
I'm having a lot of fun.

456
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,960
The producer is drained.

457
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,200
Yes, right from the start of the day.

458
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,240
What did the producer say?

459
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,680
"What are the cast members doing?"
"Why is there nobody here?!"

460
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
Take a look.

461
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,320
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

462
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,880
All the 7 cast members are here.

463
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,240
As we're talking,
it's almost time for them to do their scenes.

464
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,320
But they're still dozing off!

465
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,080
They just spoke through a walkie-talkie and said,
"Girls, 4 of you, go downstairs."

466
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,480
But none of them budged.

467
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,040
Yeah.

468
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,400
Okay...

469
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,040
Let's see how chaotic today will be.

470
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,400
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!!

471
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,040
How was the first scene of the day?

472
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,600
We did a scene so early in the morning.

473
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,840
I'm still sleepy.

474
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,200
Yeah.

475
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,840
I've done my first scene, yet I'm still sleepy.

476
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,360
I think I can get through the rest of the day.

477
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,840
Yeah, I think so.

478
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,440
I'm not that energized just yet,

479
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,920
...you know?

480
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,640
It's kinda challenging.

481
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,600
How should I explain it?

482
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,680
I have to do scenes
with a lot more diverse camera angles.

483
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,520
Yeah, the camera angles.

484
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,600
It's kinda hard.

485
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,840
What was that?

486
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,560
No, my character isn't that mischievous.

487
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,240
He's like...

488
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,040
He tries to tease...

489
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,120
He follows Nail
and tries to flirt with him, you know?

490
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,040
Please root for Techin, guys.

491
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,120
Let's interview others.

492
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,240
They're doing a scene over there.

493
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,440
Let's go!

494
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,080
Hello!

495
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Let's talk to her instead.

496
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,120
She'll talk to us.

497
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,240
Follow me. She'll 100% talk to us.

498
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,680
Hello!

499
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,800
- What's your name?
- Hello.

500
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,800
Your name, please?

501
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,080
This is such an exclusive BTS video.

502
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,680
Now, you know
how stuck up the cast members are.

503
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
They're not saying anything.

504
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,800
OK. I'll let them rest.

505
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,640
Girl, it's your turn. Hi!

506
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,680
Hello.

507
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,960
- How's it going?
- I didn't mean to look at the camera.

508
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,840
- It wasn't your turn yet.
- Oh.

509
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,040
There was a little mistake.

510
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,440
Hello.

511
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,800
How's it going?
What look are you serving today?

512
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,680
I'm going with a fierce vibe today.

513
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,200
- A fierce vibe?
- Yep.

514
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,320
- You seem casual compared to your friends.
- Really?

515
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,200
- Yeah.
- Oops.

516
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,520
Others had their moments.

517
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,200
They were being so dramatic.

518
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Show me your earrings.

519
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,160
Show me your earrings.

520
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,440
- Alright! That's dramatic.
- They're casual.

521
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,960
They're usually fancier.

522
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,320
- Is this casual?
- Mm.

523
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,920
Is it, though?

524
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,680
I'm going with a casual vibe
'cause my friends are taking the spotlight.

525
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,360
So, it's just casual me today.

526
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,880
Yeah.

527
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,960
The first two that were stuck up

528
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,840
- are taking the spotlight.
- Yep.

529
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,080
They showed up at the salon at 5 A.M.

530
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,600
- and came out at 10 A.M.
- Totally.

531
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah.

532
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,880
You still look like a student.

533
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,760
- Yeah.
- But those two look like...

534
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
they're about to graduate soon.

535
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,000
- Get it? Right?
- Yeah.

536
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,440
Alright, next one.

537
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,480
I can't walk up to you because...

538
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,960
Hello!

539
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,840
How are you feeling today?

540
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,200
- What do you want me to say?
- You're Yihwa, right?

541
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,080
You play her.

542
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,800
- I play Yihwa.
- See?

543
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,840
Now, I'm the one who's misunderstood.

544
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,560
- Is it?
- Yeah!

545
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,760
- Is it?
- Whom do I play?

546
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,160
- Ployli.
- It's Ployli.

547
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,400
She plays Phaploy!

548
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,080
Your character's name is all that matters.

549
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,120
How rude!

550
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,160
This is so exclusive.
Whom do you play?

551
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,360
- I play Phaploy.
- No, it's Ployli.

552
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,800
- It's Phaploy.
- She's messing with you!

553
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,640
- Phaploy?
- And you believed her.

554
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,840
She's Ployli.

555
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,200
- You're Somsom.
- No.

556
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,240
She's the dramatic one.

557
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,400
She's Somsom.

558
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,760
Wait for the camera to pan.

559
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,880
Whom does she play?

560
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,560
- Whom do you play?
- She plays Him.

561
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,200
- Whom do you play?
- Chao Phraya.

562
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,280
Chao Phraya?

563
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,520
- Chao what?
- I play Chaochom.

564
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,600
Not Chao Phraya.

565
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,560
I rarely saw you on set. How come?

566
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
- How come?
- Little screen time?

567
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,200
You saw me often!

568
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,880
More often than the two behind you.

569
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,040
That's harsh!
Do you know what Chaochom said?

570
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,200
- What was it?
- She said...

571
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,760
I'd seen her more often
than Ployli and Yihwa.

572
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,920
Aren't you scared of them?
They're a gang of four.

573
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,520
- I'm not because I'm so innocent.
- It's fine.

574
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,840
We made a plan this morning.

575
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,640
- What plan?
- What kind of plan?

576
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,400
Tell us.

577
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,080
- We're messing with Chaochom.
- Tell them.

578
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,840
- You'll see.
- The two of us were in a car.

579
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,120
And we came up with a plan.

580
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,480
- We were curious...
- It's Chaochom.

581
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,480
about why Chaochom had
more screen time and lines than us.

582
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,200
- We couldn't tolerate it.
- Right.

583
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,240
- So, we devised a plan.
- The ones who got Chaochom into this industry...

584
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,960
- Were us.
- ...were us.

585
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,080
- How could Chaochom have more lines than us?
- I know.

586
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,120
So, we're getting rid of her.

587
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,400
See?
You need to be cautious on set now.

588
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,640
- You could just get beaten up.
- I know.

589
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,120
- Poor girl.
- We work closely, too.

590
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,000
She's the only innocent one here.

591
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,800
Alright. How's it going, Peat?

592
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
He's Chaogum. (=karma police)

593
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,920
- I'm...
- She's Chaochom. You're Chao what?

594
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,320
- I'm Chaogum. What is this?
- Chaogum.

595
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,560
- How are you feeling today?
- Chao what?

596
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,480
Whom do you play, Peat?

597
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,040
I play Pae.

598
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,520
I've asked you in every interview
whom you play.

599
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,440
I know, right?

600
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,760
- Yeah.
- She can't remember the names.

601
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,160
- You're right.
- I play Pae.

602
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,120
What's up?

603
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,280
You play Pae, right?
I get it right sometimes.

604
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,280
Depends on how I feel.

605
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,440
- Ask me questions.
- You're Pae.

606
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,360
What's your scene count for today?

607
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,520
I have about 7 scenes today,

608
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,640
but I won't be saying much.

609
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,240
You have 9 scenes!

610
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,840
The one with me downstairs?

611
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,120
That's 7 scenes.

612
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,160
It's 9!

613
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,360
- 9 scenes, alright.
- Aren't you on the same set?

614
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,080
Is it 9 or 7 scenes?

615
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,720
- It's 7 because...
- It's 9!

616
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,520
Fine, let's go with 8 scenes, then.

617
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,440
Ah! It might be a bit too early.

618
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,320
They might not be fully awake.

619
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,280
Pan the camera here.

620
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,480
She's still asleep.

621
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,920
Hold on. Peat, you play...

622
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,120
Let's do this again.

623
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,040
Hello.

624
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,160
We're done with all the scenes.

625
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,880
Now, we have to...
What's wrong with you?

626
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,640
We have to go back
and restore our energy.

627
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,120
We're good at that.

628
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,320
So, next time, we can give it our all,

629
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,640
which is in 15 days.

630
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,920
15 more days of shooting?

631
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,520
I mean, the shoot is 15 days away.

632
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,800
Oh, it's 15 days away.

633
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,840
Even longer.

634
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,800
Oh, OK.

635
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,720
Yeah, the next shoot is on the 15th.

636
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,120
I'm rooting for all of us.

637
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,800
We're switching to chill mode.

638
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,840
So...

639
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,560
I'll miss you like coffee needs sugar.

640
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,880
Whom do you miss?

641
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,080
Hey.

642
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,200
It should've ended there.
