1
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,760
You don't want me to undress you?

2
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
You do it, too.

3
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,080
What's wrong, Him?

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,760
Nothing.

5
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,840
Are you tired, my baby?

6
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Yeah, but not that bad.

7
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,600
You've always been on your phone lately, Jay.

8
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,960
It's nothing.

9
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
Just working on a group project.

10
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,840
Hello?

11
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,280
Jay's with you, isn't he?

12
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
He won't pick up my calls.

13
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,079
Who's this?

14
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,120
I'm sharing my man with you.

15
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,920
Who are you?

16
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,160
You're curious?

17
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,960
Then, come to Jay's room

18
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,480
and give me my man back.

19
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,200
If you're sick, get help.

20
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,560
Don't mess around like this.

21
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,320
I'll make Jay break up with you.
Just you wait, Nail!

22
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,680
SOS

23
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,760
Ready

24
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,440
- Ready
- Ready

25
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,760
We’re all together,right?

26
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,400
I'll say this one time.

27
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,680
Is anything wrong, Nail?

28
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,040
Right. What's wrong?

29
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,880
A second ago,

30
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,640
someone called me
and claimed Jay was her man.

31
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,600
What? For real?

32
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
Did she make it up?

33
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,080
Ask Jay if he cheated on you, then.

34
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,160
Who would admit it, Chaochom?

35
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,280
What should we do, then?

36
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,000
We should find out if it's true.

37
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,760
If it is, Nail should just break up with him.

38
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,400
What if she was just making it up?

39
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,440
Okay. I think I'll follow him to his room

40
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,159
to find out the truth.

41
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
I'll go now.

42
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,080
Who were you talking to?

43
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,880
I was talking to Chaochom and Pae.

44
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,560
What was it about?

45
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,440
I won't tell you. You'll find out later.

46
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,080
Okay.

47
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,080
I'll be waiting for your surprise.

48
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,480
Oh, you're really here.

49
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
- Leave.
- Why would I?

50
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,760
This is my man's room.

51
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,320
- Jay!
- Stop it!

52
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,920
Make sure he'll choose you, Nail.

53
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm rooting for you.

54
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
This is so fun!

55
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Nail, why did you follow me here?

56
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,000
Why did you do this shit to me?

57
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,920
What did I do?

58
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,280
I wouldn't ask if I were this bold.

59
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,200
Be honest.

60
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,520
Do you think
our relationship's been doing well, Nail?

61
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,600
I know that you don't love me anymore.

62
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,200
Why didn't you just break up with me

63
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,680
instead of doing this shit to me?

64
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,240
It's because you've never cared about me.

65
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,480
Why wouldn't I?

66
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,840
Do you know how I'm feeling now?

67
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,600
My feelings changed because of you, Nail.

68
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,240
You should've told me
what you didn't like about me

69
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
so that I could change.

70
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,200
Cheating was not a solution.

71
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,440
You don't like my friends.

72
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,480
I always had to go out alone.

73
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,720
And things about you,
I'm always the last to know.

74
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,360
I...am just nothing to you, Nail.

75
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,360
I'm also the last to know about yours.

76
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,240
I let you be alone and go out alone

77
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
so that you could have time with your friends.

78
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
You could go anywhere you wanted

79
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,760
and come back as late as you wished

80
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,919
because I knew that you enjoyed it.

81
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,480
You said I didn't love you anymore...

82
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,679
- That's a lie.
- What do you want?

83
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,800
I don't have any feelings for you.

84
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,720
- You want a breakup?
- Yes! I surely do.

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,920
Fine! We're over.

86
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,560
You bastard!

87
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,720
Right. Please take care of that bastard for me,

88
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
you asshole.

89
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,320
What?! Nail!!

90
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,080
Scolding hurts, still pushing my head

91
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,120
Is everything alright, Jay?

92
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,320
Can you be my boyfriend?

93
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,200
Try this.

94
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
You're burning up.

95
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,640
So, you found Jay with that woman in his room?

96
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,720
Yeah.

97
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
What did he say?

98
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,640
"You don't like my friends."

99
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,680
"I always had to go out alone."

100
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,800
"And things about you,
I'm always the last to know."

101
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,520
"I...am just nothing to you, Nail."

102
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,200
He said I'd never cared about his feelings,

103
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,920
so he cheated.

104
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,320
How much attention did he need

105
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,640
to make him happy?

106
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,960
It's not your fault.

107
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,160
Cheaters are gaslighters.

108
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,120
Chaochom!

109
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,760
Chaochom!

110
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,840
Come with me for a minute.

111
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,520
- Take care of him.
- Okay.

112
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,400
Be right back.

113
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,960
Alcohol won't make you forget him.

114
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,560
Pae, tell me.

115
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,040
Why would someone do this to another?

116
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,080
He made the first move,

117
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,000
asked me out,

118
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,600
and said he loved me.

119
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,920
But in the end,

120
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,680
he did that shit to me.

121
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,560
Don't give that bastard a shit.

122
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,080
You deserve so much more.

123
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,360
You're drunk?

124
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,040
No.

125
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,600
I'll go to the toilet. Be right back.

126
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,600
- You're okay here?
- Yeah.

127
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,320
Can I buy you a drink?

128
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,600
Me?

129
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,120
I want to know you.

130
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,120
I overheard that you just got dumped.

131
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,680
That's rude.

132
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,560
I apologize.

133
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,920
Let me cheer you up.

134
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,640
I don't think you should.

135
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Well...

136
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,960
Can I just get...

137
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,320
If you want to know me,

138
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,640
have fun trying.

139
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:04,880
Him.

140
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,160
Him.

141
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,920
Him.

142
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,680
Him!

143
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,440
- What the fuck?
- What?!

144
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,600
What's wrong?

145
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,280
Hungover?

146
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,720
Is something on your mind?

147
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,800
Nothing.

148
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,440
I don't buy it.

149
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,040
What are you thinking?

150
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,880
I think...

151
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,200
I found someone...

152
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,240
who could make me feel better!

153
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,920
Did you mean...someone you like?

154
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,000
- Yeah.
- Jeez!

155
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,080
Get him! Come on!

156
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,079
- I can't.
- Why not?

157
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,720
What's his name? Tell me.

158
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,480
I might know him.

159
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,079
- That's the problem.
- What?

160
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,480
I don't know his name,

161
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,520
but I'll find him!

162
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,000
- Okay. Tell me if I can help you with anything.
- Okay.

163
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,880
Have you talked to Te yet?

164
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,960
Let bygones be bygones.

165
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,720
Reconcile with him already.

166
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,720
Reconcile?

167
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,280
Guys, I'm starving.

168
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,520
I'll have something before class.

169
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
No need to hurry, Dream.

170
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,520
Te's not here yet.

171
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,040
Wait. I didn't tell you?

172
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,000
Te said he'd be late. Don't wait for him.

173
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,760
What? Where is he?

174
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,800
Modeling for a clothing brand
as usual, maybe.

175
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,440
I see. He's getting more money
even though he's already rich?

176
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,160
Just let him do it.

177
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,600
I'll find something to eat now. It's time.

178
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,480
What about you?
You're not modeling with Te anymore?

179
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,800
No. I'm busy.

180
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,760
I see. Busy thinking of someone
whose name you don't know?

181
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,080
Flower Club tonight?
You might get his name.

182
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,960
What would you like?

183
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,200
One glass of whiskey, please.

184
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,840
It's alright, dude. You'll find him one day.

185
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
I want to see him.

186
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,040
Who could get him this worse?

187
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Come on. Let's drink.

188
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,960
- We're not here together often.
- Come on.

189
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

190
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,040
Guys, do you think
that looks like my future girlfriend?

191
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,640
Almost.

192
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,520
Look. Her boyfriend's here.

193
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,720
You'll have to get in line, Chao.

194
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,960
When will it be my turn?

195
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm sick of this.

196
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,320
Jeez.

197
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,160
It's like I'm watching an MV

198
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,560
with 2 main characters in it.

199
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,720
Him.

200
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,760
- Guys!
- What?

201
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,440
What game?

202
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,920
Let's play a game.

203
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,000
The "007 BANG!" game.

204
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,720
- No.
- What?

205
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,280
- I'll leave now.
- What?!

206
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,760
You don't want to see that guy anymore?

207
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,400
Who are you waiting for anyway?

208
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,160
You're so out of the loop.

209
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,720
- Him told me that he found someone...
- Shut it, Chao.

210
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,560
Fine. Let's change the topic.

211
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,320
Should we go to another place?

212
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,520
Should we go to another place?

213
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,840
- Let's go have fun.
- Yeah.

214
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,400
You're coming, Te?

215
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,080
What's with him?

216
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,280
Let’s go

217
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,400
Let’s go Te

218
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,280
You can go yourself.

219
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,520
I thought you wouldn't come.

220
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,640
I was waiting for you.

221
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,000
Why were you?

222
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,040
Excuse me. Get me the usual one.

223
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,320
Sure.

224
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,840
You told me to try.

225
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,440
Sorry, but I don't want to see you.

226
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,760
As usual, sir.

227
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,240
Thank you.

228
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,160
May I please get to know you?

229
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,800
Honestly, I don't think
'get to know me' is the right phrase.

230
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,200
'Sleep with me' is the right one

231
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,200
Sir, 2 more of this.

232
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,560
Drink with me, please.

233
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,200
Nail

234
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,840
I want to talk to you.

235
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,320
We're over.
Why do I need to talk to you?

236
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,080
I just wanted to say that... I'm sorry.

237
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,320
I think this suits you.

238
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,320
What's your favorite color?

239
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,000
I think...it's black.

240
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,200
- Which one do you like?
- This one's pretty.

241
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,480
So, let me get it for you
as your birthday gift this year.

242
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,840
Really?

243
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,200
Here's your stuff.

244
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,000
Nail,

245
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,080
you put my watch in a trash bag?

246
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,680
I know it's my fault. I'm sorry.

247
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,000
You were so bold. Why are you sorry now?

248
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,680
I really feel bad, Nail.

249
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,280
Quit bullshitting.

250
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,840
What, Jay? Why would you drop that?

251
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,720
Go get it.

252
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,080
Do you think
the club will be crowded tonight, Chaochom?

253
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,440
I think so.
There might not be that many people, though.

254
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,520
I'm dressing up.

255
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,080
What's with my friend?

256
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,320
He's going out every single night.

257
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,520
So?

258
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,160
You're going tonight?

259
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,920
You'll find out.

260
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,640
That, for sure, means yes.

261
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,440
I'm not going, though.

262
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,560
It's fine.

263
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,880
I can just go there alone.

264
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm feeling bored.

265
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,000
I just want to have fun and enjoy myself.

266
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,560
Why are you bored?

267
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,880
Or...

268
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,280
did Jay mess with you again?

269
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,520
What a bastard ex.

270
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,440
He left when he wanted to,
and he came when he wished to,

271
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,600
thinking the world revolves around him.

272
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,840
Did he do anything to you?

273
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,120
Jay? He can do nothing to me.

274
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,040
I'll go now. See you at the club.

275
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,000
This drink's excellent.

276
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,840
It smells so good. Try smelling it.

277
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,040
- It's not sharp, right?
- It's from the year 2000.

278
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,800
It's good.

279
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,160
One glass of blue margarita, please.

280
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,880
Sure.

281
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,400
Here's your blue margarita.

282
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,040
Thank you.

283
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,160
- Are you not sick of me yet?
- No.

284
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,400
I really want to know you.

285
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,760
How about this?
If you can order a drink I like,

286
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,800
I'll reward you with something.

287
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Reward?

288
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,040
Wanna try?

289
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,560
Sure.

290
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,520
Yes?

291
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,080
I ordered a drink
that I think suits you best.

292
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,280
It draws my attention,

293
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
and it gives me an urge to play with fire.

294
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,880
I like that.

295
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,560
My reward?

296
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
I'm Nail.

297
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,760
Okay, Nail.

298
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,880
I want to know more about you.

299
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
One more game?

300
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,320
Sure.

301
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,040
If I win,

302
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,240
can my reward be taking you home?

303
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,840
I like that.

304
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,840
I lost. You won.

305
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,560
You don't want me to undress you?

306
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,480
You do it, too.

307
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,159
What's wrong, Him?

308
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,199
Nothing.

309
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,440
You're awake?

310
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,760
Yeah, for a while now.

311
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,600
Can I borrow your shirt?

312
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
I don't like wearing the same shirt.

313
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,240
I don't like wearing the same shirt.

314
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,560
Sure.

315
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,680
In exchange for your LINE ID.

316
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,640
Are you hitting on me?

317
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,960
Yeah, may I?

318
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,920
You've already redeemed your reward.

319
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,000
So, I don't think you can do that.

320
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,280
What if...I only use it
to ask you to have fun with me?

321
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,560
Is that alright?

322
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,240
I'm fine with that, as long as you are.

323
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,120
I'm fine.

324
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,560
Having you with me is enough.

325
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,640
If you borrow my shirt,
you'll have to give it back.

326
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,440
Okay?

327
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,720
I'll use a delivery service to do that.

328
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,400
I'll take a shower now.

329
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,160
Here's your shirt.

330
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,400
- Thanks.
- No problem.

331
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,720
Do you have any concealers?

332
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,400
You want one? I'll buy it for you.

333
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's fine. I'm leaving soon.

334
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,440
How?

335
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,920
A taxi, maybe.

336
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,320
Let me take you home.

337
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,440
I don't want to bother you.

338
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,360
For you, I can do anything.

339
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,840
But...

340
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,040
Do you know how to drive?

341
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,720
Why?

342
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,160
Well, you can use my car.

343
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,680
You have that much trust in me?

344
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,480
It's not hard to find you.

345
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,200
How about this?

346
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,760
Take me to my condo.

347
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,440
Then, take me to the college.
Can you do that?

348
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,080
Of course.

349
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,160
You're so sweet.

350
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,800
My condo is not far from the college.

351
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,240
We go to the same college, don't we?

352
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,400
I don't know.

353
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,560
You'll find out.

354
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,440
Okay.

355
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,280
Get out. I'll take a shower.

356
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,800
I don't want to.

357
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,880
Go! I'll take a shower.

358
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,200
Can I join you?

359
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,120
No! Leave!

360
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,440
Tell me when you're done, okay?

361
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,920
Girls, that car's stunning.

362
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,440
- It's my dream car!
- Fabulous!

363
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,640
It's stunning.

364
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,120
They're parking at our faculty.

365
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,200
If it's a man, he's mine.

366
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,520
- Stop it, Som.
- What?

367
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,480
You're too fast.

368
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,400
- Who's in there?
- Right.

369
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,120
Someone's sending Nail off?

370
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,360
It's over.

371
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,440
Is that Nail's boyfriend?

372
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,120
Wait. Does his boyfriend have a car?

373
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,160
No! They just broke up.

374
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,080
You girls are so out of the loop!

375
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,760
Jeez, how come?

376
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,480
I'm also curious about who sent him off.

377
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,760
When did you get here?

378
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,600
A while ago.

379
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,840
Were you eavesdropping, Chaochom?

380
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,800
Gosh, you guys were so loud.
Everyone could hear that.

381
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,360
Girls, curiosity is also known as...

382
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,280
- nosi...
- Nosiness!

383
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,120
- Nosiness?!
- That's so harsh.

384
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,520
Pae! How could you say that to your friends?

385
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,400
- We were just worried about Nail, right?
- Right!

386
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,840
He was in the car
with someone we don't know.

387
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,920
- It's normal that we were worried.
- Right!

388
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,440
Thanks for worrying about me...

389
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,360
Let's go, Pae.

390
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,520
See you in class, girls.

391
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,160
- They're so harsh toward us!
- Right!

392
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,880
Do you think Nail is secretly cursing at us?

393
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,160
- No.
- He's not?

394
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,480
- Let's go.
- To where?

395
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
To the class!

396
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,440
I forgot to bring my pencils.

397
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,000
You can just borrow mine or buy a new one.

398
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,280
You'll copy others' work anyway.
Don't worry about that.

399
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,000
- Hey.
- What?

400
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,480
Help me with the work.

401
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,080
Help what? Dream's not even here.

402
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,480
It's a group project.

403
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,640
Can we get it done by today? Hurry!

404
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,360
- What?
- Let me see that.

405
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,040
See what? It's my phone.

406
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,120
Nail, someone's calling you.

407
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,040
I won't pick it up.

408
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,600
[Why didn't you pick up my call?]

409
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,120
[Pay attention in class]

410
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,000
[I want to see you again today]

411
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,360
[Why didn't you pick up my call?]

412
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,080
[Pay attention in class]

413
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,120
[I want to see you again today]

414
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,240
Buzz-buzz-buzz! It won't stop buzzing!

415
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,520
Answer that.

416
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,960
- It kept buzzing.
- Focus on your work.

417
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,920
Answer that already.

418
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,520
Hurry.

419
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,880
[Let me think about it first]

420
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,720
Nail. What now? I already answered that.

421
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,080
Can I see your notes?

422
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,800
I couldn't catch up.

423
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,000
No! It's because you didn't pay attention.

424
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,360
Please, Nail. Let me see it.

425
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,480
Ask Chaochom to see hers.

426
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,360
What?

427
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,520
Nail, who are you talking to?

428
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,200
No one.

429
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,520
Stop hedging.

430
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,720
Who were you with?

431
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,960
I see. He's Him.

432
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,160
And he's your...

433
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,200
We've met many times.

434
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,080
We clicked, so we started talking.

435
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,480
Is he the same person
you were with last night?

436
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,720
And he also owns that BMW sports car?

437
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,080
- It's great that you've moved on now.
- That's not it.

438
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,960
We're just having fun together.

439
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,040
What? You mean you're not together?

440
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,600
Yeah.

441
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,760
Why? What's with those faces?

442
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,560
Nail, that kind of relationship
won't make you feel better.

443
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,000
Right. Think about it carefully, Nail.

444
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,280
You still have us.

445
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,040
I don't think what you're doing is good.

446
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,160
Whenever you're ready for a relationship...

447
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,760
There won't be any more relationships.

448
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,600
I'm completely fine with this.
