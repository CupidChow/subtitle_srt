You're my best friend, Te.

This is Nail.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,140
Nail?

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,600
We're friends.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,880
Is this how you wanted to start over?

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,840
What are you doing?

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,110
Making you realize.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,810
You know what? You're my type.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,220
Stay away from him. He's mine.

10
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,550
Were you...spying on me as I slept?

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,750
I wasn't spying on you.

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,820
Come on.

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,000
- Did you sleep well?
- Mm.

14
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,840
For the things I said last night...

15
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,270
That we're gonna be a couple?

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,050
Mm. But...

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,050
we're going be a couple just for 1 week.

18
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,550
Are you okay with that?

19
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,890
If you're comfortable with that,
I'm okay.

20
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,539
Then... For a week,

21
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,970
let's be together.

22
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,539
Sure. We're together.

23
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,620
I'll go take a shower.

Where are you going?

25
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,490
We're a couple now, honey.

26
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,200
Nonsense. I'll go now.

27
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,130
- Where are you going?
- I'll go take a shower.

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
Stay with me.

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,370

Well, I saw my ex.

78
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,860
Should we go somewhere else?

It's fine.

81
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,570
We can go somewhere else.

82

someone who hurt you,

right?

It's fine. It's totally fine.

87
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,800

97
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,130

98
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,870

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,620
Thank you.

100
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,820
This is my mom's new restaurant.

101
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,990
This set is called The Major Tray.

102
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,900
I made all the recipes
and let the cook make them.

103
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,460
Give it a try.

104
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Mmm... What are these dishes?

105
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,410
A lot of foreigners come to this place,

106
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,610
so I came up with this set

107
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,080
to present dishes from all 4 regions.

108
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,610
There's Hang Lay curry,

109
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,020
fermented fish entrails soup,

110
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,580
bamboo shoot and Yanang soup,

111
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,490
and spicy shrimp paste sauce.

112
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,560
Can you eat all of these?
Are you okay?

113
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,500
Honestly, I've never tried these before.

114
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,430
However, they all look very good.

115
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,270
I'll try them.

116
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,640
Here.

117
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Here's the Hang Lay curry.

118
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,710
Thanks.

119
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,190
It's good.

120
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,230
It's not spicy.

121
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,630
I like it.

122
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,030
Then, I'll cook it for you.

123
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,670
You're good at everything, huh?

124
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,770
Not really.

125
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,510
Do you want to try
the fermented fish entrails soup next?

126
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,690
You don't eat vegetables?

127
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,030
Yes, I don't like vegetables.

128
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,530
Okay. I'll remember that.

129
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,970
And...what is your favorite food?

130
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,170
Anything without veggies.

131
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,510
I love steamed eggs.

132
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,610
Well, my legs don't grow roots...

133
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,410
Do you want to try me?

134
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,050
I'll think about it first.

135
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,790
Don't make it long.

136
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,530
Let's dig in. That was a joke.

137
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,750
I ordered all of your favorite dishes.

138
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,420
That's good. Thanks, Nail.

139
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,560
Jay, I want to eat that fried pork...

140
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,830
Okay, have some first.
You can eat anything you want.

141
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,230
Girl, I think that's Him's new lover.

142
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,670
The way they looked at each other
was so lovely.

143
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,940
Honestly, I'm pretty shocked

144
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,410
that he looks exactly like his ex.

145
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,140
Yeah! You're right!

146
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,550
I was thinking that, too.
They look identical.

147
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,580
Is he the same person?

148
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,160
He's good, though.
You can't tell them apart.

149
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,260
There. Do we need anything else?

150
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,800
I think that's all.

151
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,370
I'm at Chaochom's dorm now.

152
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,440
I'll go now.

153
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,340
Okay. Tell Chaochom to get well soon.

154
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,540
Call me when you're done.
I'll pick you up.

155
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,610
Mm.

156
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,410
Nail.

157
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Do you live here?

158
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,650
No, I'm here to see my friend.

159
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,290
Me too.

160
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,390
Why did you buy those drugs?
Are you ill?

161
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,260
They're for my friend.

162
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,730
Do you need to know this, too?

163
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,340
My friend also lives here.

164
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,100
Can I come with you?

165
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,950
We ran into each other again.

166
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,050
Do you think...this is destiny?

167
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,130
Him and I are dating.

168
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,100
Do you think that's destiny?

169
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,370
You can date,
and you can break up, too.

170
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,970
Him has told me everything.

171
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,210
And...do you know about Blue?

172
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,550
Yeah.

173
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,190
And you're still dating him?

174
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,230
I told you not to come!
Why are you here?

175
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,660
If you catch a cold from me...

176
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,500
If I didn't come,
who would take care of you?

177
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,470
Here are your food and drugs.
I bought them for you.

178
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,340
No!

179
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,310
Stay here. I'll do it for you.

180
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,450
Nail, I forgot to wear a face mask.

181
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,560
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold from me.

182
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,590
It's fine. I won't catch your cold.

183
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,590
Just worry about yourself.

184
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,200
Eat up and take the drugs.

185
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,630
Fine. I know what to do.

186
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,170
Mm. I'll put this in a bowl for you.

187
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,380
[Te]

188
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,510
[Te: Do you know how shitty Him was
when he was with Blue?]

189
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,850
[Te: If you don't, I'll tell you]

190
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,030
Why didn't you pick it up?
Was it a spam call?

191
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,130
Right.

192
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,270
Eat up, so you'll get well soon.

193
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,700
I know.

194
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,940
Please.

195
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,510
Come on. Take a seat.

196
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,820
Eat up and get well soon.

197
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,790
Thank you so much.

198
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,730
By the way, would you mind
taking your shoes off?

199
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,500
Oops, sorry. I forgot.

200
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,620
Te, I've done a few slides already.

201
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,620
What's left is a chart for...

202
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,860
Te...

203
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,300
Do you know that
Him and Nail are dating?

204
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,500
Good for them.

205
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,710
No.

206
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,870
That's not fair for Blue.

207
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,180
It's been a long time.

208
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,750
Just be happy for your friend.

209
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,220
Fuck no.

210
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,390
Do you know how much he hurt Blue
when they were together?

211
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,920
I have no idea.

212
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,130
Did Blue tell you that?

213
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,400
Yes.

214
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,660
I'm always aware of that.

215
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,540
Were you always thinking about Blue
as more than just a friend?

216
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,510
Yes.

217
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,110
That bastard doesn't deserve to be loved.

218
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,210
I'll take Nail from him.

219
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,290
Yes?

220
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,990
Your parcel is here!

221
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,790
Who's this?

222
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,600
Come get your parcel, please.

223
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,630
Chao?

224
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,040
Whoa! You actually remember my voice!

225
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,340
Babe, open the door for me.

226
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,310
How did you get here?

227
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,140
Am I good?

228
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,410
Leave.

229
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,580
I'm not free.

230
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,850
Can't I just be in the room with you?

231
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,290
No!

232
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,890
Come on, babe.

233
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,400
Babe, open the door.

234
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,100
If you don't open the door,

235
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,170
I won't stop knocking.

236
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,220
Come in if you want.

237
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,740
You're the cutest, babe.

238
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,840
Why are you here?

239
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,240
I wanted to see your face.

240
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,340
I miss you.

241
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,180
Fine. No cuddles.

242
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,820
Can I get a kiss instead?

243
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
That's too much.

244
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,890
You're here only to have sex with me?

245
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,660
It's not like that!

246
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,300
I just want to be with you.

247
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,930
We're not together.
Why would you want to be with me so badly?

248
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,700
Then, what should we be?

249
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,810
What do you want to be?

250
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,270
Your lover.

251
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,540
A friend with benefits is enough.

252
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,250
Don't settle down with me.

253
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,050
You'll meet a lot more people,

254
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,720
and you'll get sick of me.

255
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,290
I won't!

256
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,700
Then, if you want to be here,
that's all you'll get.

257
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,770
What do you mean by that?

258
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,100
Just having sex.

259
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,680
And if you want to come here,
tell me first.

260
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,480
I have work to do.

261
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,150
Don't be childish.

262
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,120
Okay! Later, I'll tell you first.

263
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,850
I'll do anything you tell me to.

264
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,060
Great.

265
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,930
Don't break into my room like this again.

266
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,700
I'll go outside now.

267
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,330
Where are you going?
Can I join you?

268
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,630
To see my ex.
Wanna come?

269
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,500
Stay here.

270
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,540
Wait... The door's over there.

271
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,940
I'm changing my outfit.

272
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,800
Just like the good old days, right?

273
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,540
Can you not mention our past anymore?

274
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,940
Why can't I?

275
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,180
- Aren't you here because...
- No.

276
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,880
Type, our breakup...

277
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,120
was mutual, wasn't it?

278
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,090
It was,

279
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,820
but I actually didn't want it.

280
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,730
How does that change anything?

281
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,600
If it's the same book,
the ending remains the same.

282
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,830
How would it be the same?

283
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,600
You didn't make it until the end.

284
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,920
Nail... Nail...

285
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,160
Nail...

286
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,000
Stay away from Him and Te.

287
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,290
Nail... Nail.

288
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,560
What's wrong?
Did you have a nightmare?

289
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,860
I was dreaming...

290
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,100
It wasn't a good dream.

291
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,800
Are you sick?

292
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,140
Jeez, you're burning up.

293
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,580
I think I caught a cold.

294
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,050
You should leave.

295
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,250
What?

296
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,250
We're together.
How could I leave you?

297
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Thank you.

298
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,000
Come on. Let's go to sleep.

299
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,990
Come on, good boy.

300
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,690
Come here.

301
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,560
Are you hungry?

302
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,000
Let's eat up,

303
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,500
so you'll feel better.

304
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,720
Is your headache gone?

305
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,860
Not yet. I'm still having it.

306
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,360
Let me see.

307
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,330
It's not as hot as it was yesterday.

308
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,520
Is it good?

309
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,860
- No.
- Oh...

310
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,100
Just kidding!

311
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,800
I won't cool it down for you, then!

312
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,180
Is it perfectly warm?

313
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,650
Come on. Eat up.

314
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,760
Do you want shrimp?

315
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,460
No, I'm full.

316
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,570
Just a few more bites, good boy.

317
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,240
Come on. Have some more.

318
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,620
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

319
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,460
That's enough. I'm full.

320
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,690
Alright. Okay, then.

321
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,340
After this meal, take your drugs
and have some rest, okay?

322
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,380
No, I won't take those.

323
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,850
Nail,

324
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,150
if you don't feel better today,
you have to see a doctor tomorrow.

325
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,220
No, I don't want to.

326
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,090
Get well soon, then.

327
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,900
I'll go get your drugs.

328
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,960
Hello?

329
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,430
I just wanted to tell you that...

330
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,000
I'll do everything
to make Nail break up with you.

331
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,080
Te! Hello?

332
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,450
Fucking...

333
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,780
Get well soon.

334
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,240
Him.

335
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,280
- Him...
- Yes?

336
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,120
Can you get me my phone?

337
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,020
Sure.

338
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,330
Who called you?

339
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,830
It was Techin.

340
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,610
Thanks.

341
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,560
Are we still dating?

342
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,470
Of course.

343
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,880
As your lover,

344
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,950
is there anything else
I need to know?

345
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,940
Hello, Type.

346
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,280
Are you free next week?
I have something for you to do.

347
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,810
What is it?

348
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,150
It's modeling for a new jeans collection
from my friend's brand.

349
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,150
Give me the date.

350
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:36,990
Fine. I'll text you the details.

351
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,060
- Type...
- Mm?

352
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,930
I want to talk to you about Him.

353
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,740
Why? What's wrong with my cousin?

354
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:56,340
He's in love with someone...
who looks exactly like Blue.

355
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,380
I'm afraid the ending might be the same.

356
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,820
Shit. He looks exactly like Blue?

357
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,260
Exactly.

358
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,900
And I think...I fell for him.

359
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,500
Shit! Again?

360
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,510
Don't let history repeat itself.

361
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,280
Fine. I'll help you out.

362
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,180
Tell me everything.

363
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,750
Thank you, Type.

364
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,930
Be honest.

365
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,400
Is there anything else
you're hiding from me?

366
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,640
What do you want to know about?

367
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,310
About...Blue.

368
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,250
You want to know about Blue?

369
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,390
Can I ask you about that?

370
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,690
Why did you guys break up?

371
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,780
It was me who neglected him,
so he left me.

372
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,020
I thought he would be my last,

373
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,190
but...

374
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:14,179
This led me to seek medical help.

375
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,190
Medical help?

376
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,590
Psychiatric consultation.

377
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,199
It's fine. I'll go get it.

378
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,909
Who are you?

379
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,690
Why are you here?

380
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,790
To get my stuff.

381
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,500
You got everything back.

382
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,500
You didn't give me The 1975 tee.

383
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,270
Fine. Stay here. I'll get it.

384
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,950
Nail found someone new pretty fast.

385
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,230
If you can't say something nice,
just shut it.

386
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,630
Why? Wasn't it nice?

387
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,200
I stated a fact.

388
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,140
Nail shouldn't have met you.

389
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,680
Are you disappointed
that I met him before you?

390
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,320
Is Nail hot in your bed?

391
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,390
- You bastard...
- Stop it, Him!

392
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,160
Here's your shirt.
Now leave.

393
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,330
Leftovers are leftovers.

394
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,100
Admit it.

395
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,370
Nail...

396
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,390
This is not your place anymore.

397
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,690
Get out!

398
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,980
He didn't respect you.

399
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,220
Why would you mess with him?

400
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,720
It was none of your business.

401
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,190
Okay. I'll leave then.

402
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,920
Hi, honey?

403
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,490
Hm?

404
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,830
Well, I wanted to say sorry.

405
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,000
For what?

406
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,670
For making you feel bad

407
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,540
and for not being nice to you.

408
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,110
It's fine. I'm okay.

409
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,380
Did you really mean it?

410
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,420
Just go to bed.

411
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,060
Good night.

412
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:12,270
[Te: Have a good night, Nail]

413
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,410
[Jay: Thank you for giving back my shirt]

414
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,320
[Jay: Good night]

415
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:30,290
[Jay: If we didn't break up,
you would've been in my arms right now]

416
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,590
They're all crazy.

417
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,340
Is this...your friend?

418
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,840
I know what I'm doing.

419
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,550
Have you forgotten about
our agreed-upon status?

420
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,190
You can talk to Him.
I'm fine with that,

421
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,920
because you're here with me.

422
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,760
Having this meal with you is enough.

423
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
It is now...

424
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,680
1 A.M.

425
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,520
I'm kidding.

426
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,560
It's still bright.
It's around 7 A.M.

427
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,260
Well...

428
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,620
There's...

429
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,660
me, Tor,

430
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,690
and this is...

431
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,300
Kong. He's here.

432
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,870
I'm showing how we're doing.

433
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,600
Well...

434
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,400
Let's...

435
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,800
Let's see

436
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,410
what we have to film today.

437
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,010
Let's ask others.

438
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,340
Let's go.

439
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,980
Hi.

440
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,910
I'm filming the first scene today alone.

441
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:35,010
There's no one in that scene.

442
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,350
I'm finishing up my makeup
and dressing up.

443
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:38,820
Oh.

444
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,190
What?

445
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,920
My pants are loose.

446
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,020
You stole my thunder.

447
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,620
He's not in this scene, though.

448
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,830
We'll film the second scene together.

449
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,800
I'll be in the first scene alone.

450
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,770
See you!

451
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,350
I just finished the first scene,

452
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,880
but it wasn't that good

453
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,650
because I wasn't fully awake.

454
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,520
And...

455
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,820
I had to use the phone in that scene,

456
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,590
but my phone...

457
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,060
ran out of credit.

458
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,490
So, it couldn't make a call.

459
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,230
The director said, "Cut!"

460
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,530
We had to re-film it.

461
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,430
It was fun, though.

462
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,000
In the next scene,
I'm filming with Dew.

463
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,300
Let's check it out!

464
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,090
We're attaching a mic to me.

465
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,700
My script is very long in this scene.

466
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,100
It's so long.
I'm not sure if I can remember it.

467
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,000
What do I have to say, Atom?

468
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,240
Nothing. Just wash the dishes.

469
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,510
Nothing? Just wash the dishes?

470
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,010
Jeez, that's funny.

471
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,380
Isn't that funny?

472
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,050
What I have to say is,

473
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,820
"Hey, Te,"
or something like that.

474
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,130
"Te, hello?"

475
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,330
Right? Am I right?

476
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:07,570
He didn't answer.

477
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,900
- Right. You're so good.
- Right?

478
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,940
I think that joke worked.
You can use it.

479
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,910
It is now 8.36 P.M.

480
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,080
All done.

481
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,850
I have to be quiet.

482
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,450
The other staff are working hard

483
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,150
because there are around
2 scenes left for Nail.

484
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,920
We have to leave this house
before 10 P.M.

485
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,330
Well, we managed our time
quite well today.

486
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,230
Also, the previous scenes were all great,

487
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,830
according to me.

488
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,400
Alright. It's Nail's day.

489
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,940
Try your best, Nail.

490
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:51,440
I saw him looking worried
in some scenes.

491
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,150
I was rooting for him.
