00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,240
But...

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,360
we're going be a couple just for 1 week.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,120
Should we go somewhere else?

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,640
It's fine.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,600
Let's eat here.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Girl, I think that's Him's new lover.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,560
Why did you buy those drugs?
Are you ill?

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Fuck no.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,320
Do you know how much he hurt Blue
when they were together?

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,360
We're not together.
Why would you want to be with me so badly?

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,440
How did you know it would be the same?

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,240
You didn't make it until the end.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,360
Nail...

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,160
Stay away from Him and Te.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,320
Type...

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,360
I want to talk to you about Him.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,720
Why? What's wrong with my cousin?

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,840
Who are you?

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,400
Nail found someone new pretty fast.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,240
This is not your place anymore.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,760
Get out!

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,400
I wanted to say sorry
for making you feel bad.

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,000
I have to take care of
my mom's new branch.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Once I'm free,
I'll come to you as soon as I can.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,720

30
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,280
Blue!

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,160
Hey... When were you here?

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,120
Just now.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,960
Are you okay?

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,440
It's okay. You can tell me.

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,680
I'm fine.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,880
I'm just...kinda lonely.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,480
Then, where do you want to go?

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll take you there.

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,960
Thanks, Te.

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,440
Without you...
I wouldn't have anyone.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,520
Thank you.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,360

Mm.

Are you not curious about
why it had to be Te for the interview?

62
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,560
You didn't ask me.

63

Why?

You've been saying that a lot.
It's getting weird now.

67
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,480
I guess it's because
I want to be your supportive lover,

who can give you
as much freedom as you want.

a dish of spicy spaghetti, please.

No.

That's all.

82
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,960
Do you remember that
I don't like veggies?

83
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,520
Yes, I do.

84
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,040
I chose Te for the interview

85
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,400
because my previous interviewee
got into an accident.

86
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,760
So, I had to replace him
with someone famous in our college,

87
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,159
which is Te.

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120

You can't make it again?

117
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,080
You haven't come to me for weeks.

118
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,960
We're together, aren't we?

119
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,200

121
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,560
you know I'm busy with my family matters.

122
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,000
Why don't you get to understand me a bit?

123
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,560
That's what you always say.

124
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,400
Do I not matter to you at all?

125
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
I don't feel good.

126
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,720

127
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,480
I really can't make it.

128
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,240

129
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,600
I'll call Te to be with you, okay?

130
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,760
I want to be with you,

131
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,520
not Te.

132
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,760
I know that you have work to do,

133
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,320
but I still feel slighted.

134
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm sorry,

135
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
but I promise you that...

136
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,160
once I'm free,
I'll come to you as soon as possible.

137
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,480

Let's eat.

145
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,240
Girl, I think that's Him's new lover.

146
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,920
The way they looked at each other
was so lovely.

147
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,840
Honestly, I'm pretty shocked

148
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,240
that he looks exactly like his ex.

149
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,360
Yeah! You're right!

150
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
I was thinking that, too.
They look identical.

151
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,280
Hello, Te.

152
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,320
The client's confirmed the work
I told you.

153
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,280
- What work?
- What?

154
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,040
Modeling for a jeans collection
as I told you.

155
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,520
I'll send you the location.
The shoot's on Sunday at 11 A.M.

156
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,320
Okay.

157
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,120
Wait, Te.

158
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
Do you have other friends to suggest?

159
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,400
For the next work,
the client wants it to be a couple.

160
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,000
Friends?

161
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,640
Him!

162
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,080
I miss you!

163
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,120
You don't come home to see me often.

164
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,360
Honey,

165
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,000
I have to work so hard on my studies.

166
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,240
Anyway, why are you still awake?

167
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,720
Mom said you'd be here,

168
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,960
so I waited.

169
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,600
Honey, it's time to go to bed.

170
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,280
Let me talk to Him first.

171
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,680
It won't take long, okay?

172
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,240
But I want him to put me to bed.

173
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,640
Honey,

174
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,800
let me talk to Mom first.

175
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,960
After that,
I'll put you to bed right away.

176
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,920
You can go upstairs with Bua first.

177
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,760
Fine.

178
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,800
Okay. Good girl.

179
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,640
I know what you want to do.

180
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,680
Alcohol won't make you forget him.

181
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,320
He asked me out

182
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,680
and said he loved me.

183
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,240
But in the end, he did that shit to me.

184
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,200
Don't give that bastard a shit.

185
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,520
You deserve so much more.

186
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,760
You're drunk?

187
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,480
I'll go to the toilet. Be right back.

188
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,920
Can I buy you a drink?

189
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,680
I want to know you.

190
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,240
I overheard that you just got dumped.

191
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
That's rude.

192
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,840
I apologize.

193
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,640
Let me cheer you up.

194
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,080
Can I join you?

195
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,880
No! Leave!

196
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,560
Tell me when you're done, okay?

197
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,040
Why would I be possessive of you?

198
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,680
We're not together.

199
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,240
It's yours.

200
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,760
That's it if you like it.

201
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,720
We're just having fun...

202
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,200
Stop it right there!

203
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,440
I don't want you to...

204
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,040
I know what I'm doing.

205
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,600
You don't go to every doctor's appointment,

206
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,440
do you?

207
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,880
From now on,

208
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,160
I promise you that
I'll always keep up with that.

209
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,360
I...

210
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,040
I'm better now, Mom.

211
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,080
Please let me be in love again.

212
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,640
I believe that...
Nail can make me feel better.

213
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,280
Please trust me.

214
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,720
Then, I'll go to Honey.

215
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,520
Good night, Mom.

216
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,320
Mmm... I don't wanna study anymore.

217
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,760
[Nail: Join me for lunch tomorrow]
[Te: Sure. Where?]

218
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,440
Me neither.
[Nail: At the canteen]

219
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,080
Only Nail loves studying.
[Te: I want it to be just us]

220
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
[Nail: Not what we agreed on,
so it's fine if you don't wanna come]

221
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,480
[Te: See you]

222
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,600
- Hey.
- What?

223
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,560
- You're studying so hard, huh?
- Of course.

224
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,240
Teach us, then.

225
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,080
- Hey, Te!
- Hi, guys.

226
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,800
Hi, Nail.

227
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,480
Are you okay with
having lunch at a canteen?

228
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,080
We're working on so many projects,

229
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,320
so we don't have time to
treat you to a good meal.

230
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,920
It's totally fine.

231
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,520
Having this meal with you is enough.

232
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,920
Mm, that's great!

233
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,480
Let's find something to eat.

234
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,160
That stand sells the best food.

235
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
You want anything? I'll get it for you.

236
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,120
It's fine. We can go together.

237
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,240
Guys, I'll buy mine from Phon's.

238
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,760
- What?
- Again?

239
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,960
What about Tawan's?

240
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,160
- Fine.
- Let's go.

241
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,320
Phon's it is.

242
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Come on.

243
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,920
Nail, are you okay?

244
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Not really.

245
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,200
You told me to invite him.

246
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
Well, I didn't know.

247
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,080
They're coming.

248
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,520
Here are your drinks.

249
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,520
Are you thirsty?

250
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,680
- Here.
- Thank you.

251
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,600
I bought this for you.

252
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,080
Okay, I'll drink it.

253
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
I want to be the main character.

254
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,720
Te, try this.

255
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,840
The food here is so good.

256
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,400
Really?

257
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,360
- Yes!
- Then,

258
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,440
if it's that good,
can I come again?

259
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,400
But your faculty's so far from here,
isn't it?

260
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,960
If I can have lunch with Nail every day,

261
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm fine with that.

262
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,360
Let's eat!

263
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,080
It's so good. Try yours.

264
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,960
It's really good.

265
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,160
So refreshing.

266
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,360
[Type: Are you interested in modeling?]

267
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
[Type: I'm Type, a model agent]

268
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:47,080
[Nail: Hi]

269
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,080
[Nail: What kind of modeling is it?]

270
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,000
Where's Chaochom?

271
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,440
Right? It sucks.

272
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
She ditched us.

273
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,160
Huh? What?

274
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,720
The project got rejected?

275
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,560
Okay, I'll be there.

276
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,240
Nail, my project got rejected.

277
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,160
I'll have to revise it.

278
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,120
The due date's today.

279
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,160
Please take care of Nail, Te.

280
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,320
Okay, sure.

281
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,440
- I'll go now.
- Okay.

282
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,280
Let's get in the car.

283
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:59,120
[Chaochom: Sorry, I have an urgent task]

284
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,840
[Nail: It's fine. I get it]

285
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,040
Who are you texting?

286
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,920
[Chaochom: Tell me when you reach home]

287
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,520
You can talk to Him.
I'm fine with that

288
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,960
because you're here with me.

289
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,720
I won't go with you.

290
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,120
I can go on my own.

291
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,560
Wait.

292
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,240
I can't let someone
I'm flirting with go home alone,

293
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,280
can I?

294
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Quit flirting with me.

295
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,880
I won't be with anyone but Him.

296
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,560
I miss you so much!

297
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,440
Will you be home tonight?

298
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,840
Why?

299
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,680
It's been 1,440 minutes
since I last saw you.

300
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,680
Nonsense!

301
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,280
Don't you miss me?

302
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,920
No!

303
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,160
Whatever.
Can I please see you today?

304
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,480
Please, please, please.

305
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,320
No, I have an appointment.

306
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,000
Again?

307
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,320
What appointment? With whom?

308
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,920
It's personal.

309
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,880
With whom?

310
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,440
I'll go now.

311
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,040
With whom, Phai? Your ex again?

312
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,640
The appointment you talked about...

313
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,560
is hanging out?

314
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,400
Whom did you go with?

315
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,960
Have you forgotten about
our agreed-upon status?

316
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,040
I haven't.

317
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,920
Then, why did you ask?

318
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,680
If you can't handle it,
we can quit this.

319
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,560
No, we won't.

320
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,920
I gave up. I won't ask you anymore.

321
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,760
- If that's all...
- There's something else.

322
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,240
- What is it?
- Something about you...

323
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,960
I'll go take a shower.

324
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,120
Can I join you, please?

325
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,600
Phai! I really have to speak with you.

326
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,240
Phai!

327
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,000
Are you drunk?

328
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,080
Not yet.

329
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,120
How was my music performance?

330
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,040
Mm, it was great.

331
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,520
Did you...get a new tattoo?

332
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Yes, I got bored,
so I tattooed myself.

333
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,200
Are you a tattoo artist?

334
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,480
I want you to tattoo me.

335
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
I want to see you work.

336
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,240
Just don't.

337
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,160
Leave now.

338
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,640
It's getting late. Go home.

339
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,560
I took a shower
and got ready to go to bed,

340
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,920
but you're telling me to leave?

341
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,800
Can I...stay tonight?

342
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,520
So cool!

343
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,720
I want to watch this every day.

344
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
I love all of them.

345
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,800
They're all looking good!

346
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,160
Right, especially the singer.

347
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,760
He's so cute and playful,
and he's got a beautiful voice.

348
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,280
Right! I like him.

349
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,160
Wait, but why wasn't Him there
last night?

350
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,040
He usually plays bass.

351
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,600
And why did they use
Stay Four as the band name?

352
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,840
Where was he?

353
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,920
What?

354
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,720
Where did he go?

355
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Guys, I found Him's Facebook.

356
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,680
Somsom, that's too fast.

357
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,880
- Look.
- Let me see.

358
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,320
He rarely posts.

359
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,920
Right.

360
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,120
"My Blue?!"

361
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,400
Oh, well...

362
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,960
Is that...Him's ex?

363
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,160
Maybe.

364
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,240
- But why does he look...
- Familiar.

365
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,240
- Right?
- He looks familiar.

366
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,080
Pae!

367
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,960
- Hi!
- Hi!!

368
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,640
Please have a seat.

369
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,560
What is it, girls?

370
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,880
Do you know Blue?

371
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,320
Girls, we have to get to the bottom of this.

372
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,080
Good morning, Charlie.

373
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,160
What is it, Angels?

374
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,040
The espionage mission has begun.

375
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,120
We have to find out who Blue is.

376
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,480
Phew!

377
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,880
Hello, Nail.

378
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,080
Why do you look...

379
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,600
I want to have Blue's cake,

380
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,320
and I want to see him.

381
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,120
Why did you do that to Blue?

382
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,920
You want to do this, huh?

383
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
It's my turn now, Him.

384
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,800
Record this.

385
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,960
Let's take some photos.

386
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,200
Smile, please.

387
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,280
Would you like some drinks?

388
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,680
Okay. Cut!

389
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,240
Bring the prop.

390
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,920
You're so fast, huh? What is this?

391
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,360
What is this?

392
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,360
- Be a host.
- Me? A host?

393
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,040
Right.

394
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,640
Can I just sleep? Or should I just leave?

395
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,160
It's not that bad.
You were only in one scene.

396
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,120
But I had to wake up early!

397
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,920
I should just go to sleep now.

398
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,840
Let me interview you.

399
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,280
He was also in the scene.

400
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,840
- Was I?
- Yes, you were.

401
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
No!

402
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,400
- Come on.
- I wasn't.

403
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,920
- What scene were you in?
- What?

404
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,720
What scene were you in?

405
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,680
The one at 5 A.M.

406
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,920
What is that?

407
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,640
You're talking nonsense.

408
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,360
Come on. Give it to me.

409
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,000
That's enough of your nonsense talk.

410
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,560
What was it...just now?

411
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,800
- The first scene?
- You're here already?

412
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,240
Yes, I am.

413
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,000
In the first scene,

414
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,400
who were in it?

415
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,040
Me, myself, and I.

416
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,320
- And who are you?
- All me.

417
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,400
- Introduce yourself.
- Okay.

418
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,320
I'm Fu, and I play Techin.

419
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,680
- Alright, Techin.
- Right.

420
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,960
Pae,

421
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,360
Chaochom,

422
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,960
and Nail were in it, too.

423
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,400
Who plays Pae?

424
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,520
- It's Peat.
- Peat?

425
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,120
- Right.
- Don't film him.

426
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm interviewing Techin.

427
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,920
And Nail? Who plays Nail?

428
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,480
It's Tor.

429
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,640
And Toon plays Chaochom.

430
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
- I see.
- Right.

431
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,320
How do you feel today?

432
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,680
- Today?
- You're a newcomer actor.

433
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,920
I feel tired, honestly.

434
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,440
Why?

435
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,680
It was so early in the morning.

436
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,600
Film him.

437
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,960
Film him. Look at the camera.

438
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,880
Say it.

439
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,200
I'm tired.

440
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,680
- Why are you tired? Tell us again.
- It was very early.

441
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,280
- I see. It was early.
- You're not just tired.

442
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,200
You're sleepy as well.

443
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,440
I'm tired...

444
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
- I'm awake, but...
- Hey!

445
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,240
He was trying to avoid it.

446
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,360
It was hot.

447
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,880
The weather wasn't nice, you know.

448
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,160
It was already hot at 7 A.M.

449
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,920
Overall, you were not nervous at all?

450
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,480
- Just sleepy?
- Yes.

451
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,960
Okay. This is the first person in the scene.

452
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,520
Next, I'll show you the other one.

453
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,320
He plays Pae.

454
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,440
- Pae...
- No...

455
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,080
He's not Pae, but he's Pee.

456
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,320
- Pee?
- Yes.

457
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,600
I guess he needs to pee.

458
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,520
Pae...

459
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,080
This is a familiar face.

460
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,360
It's Pae.

461
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,720
Introduce yourself.

462
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,480
What's your name?

463
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,880
I'm Peat Suchanon.

464
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,720
I play Pae.

465
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,840
Who's Pae? Tell them.

466
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,280
Pae's a friend of Nail and the girls.

467
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,480
- Right.
- Really?

468
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,520
Yes!

469
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
But he has his match, though.

470
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,520
Really?

471
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,440
You're talking too much.

472
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,880
Is that a spoiler?

473
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,280
- Hey!
- Yeah!

474
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,840
He might have a lover.

475
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,640
If he doesn't, you'll feel embarrassed.

476
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,160
This could record your voice.

477
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,600
But who cares?

478
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,880
Tell them who Pae's match is.

479
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,720
How do you feel...

480
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,920
- It was pretty chill.

481
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,680
- Whoa, you're a pro now?
- No.

482
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,800
I mean, in my first series,

483
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,640
I was very tense

484
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,160
because it was my first series.

485
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,880
But since this is the second one,

486
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,920
and I got to know the staff,

487
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,920
I know what to do when filming.

488
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,520
Like, paying attention and so on.

489
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,840
I'm getting more relaxed.

490
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
That is to say,
you are experienced?

491
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,080
Kinda.

492
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,400
Okay.

493
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,400
This guy was also in the scene.

494
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,960
Wave goodbye to the camera.

495
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,120
Yes, that one.

496
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
Perfect!

497
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,880
Again.

498
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,240
I haven't practiced at all!

499
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,000
- Do you need to practice?
- Nope.

500
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,520
I'm being filmed.

501
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,080
Oops, I can do it now.

502
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,240
Right. Nice.

503
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,120
Come on, Yaya.

504
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,320
Show me.

505
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,440
Stand in front of us
and turn around.

506
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,120
- Teach me.
- Turn around.

507
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,920
- Turn around.
- 1, 2, and 3.

508
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,600
- Can you do it?
- No.

509
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,680
Take that out, and let's do just this.

510
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,680
1...2...3...

511
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,680
Right, let's do just that.

512
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,000
Right!

513
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,840
- You're so good at this!
- You are!

514
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,840
"Good morning, Charlie."

515
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,680
"What is it, Angels?"

516
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
How was it? Did you sleep well?

517
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,640
What happened?

518
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,920
I slept very well.

519
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,480
I just woke up.

520
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,640
Was it a good sleep?

521
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,920
Kinda.

522
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,560
- You're awake now?
- Yes.

523
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,080
- I gained some energy.
- Are you ready for the shoot now?

524
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:46,920
I am.

525
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,920
Wait, they're showing our pictures.
Rude.

526
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,000
How's this person?

527
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,760
Look at them, jeez.

528
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,080
This girl slept like a rock.

529
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,520
They told me to sleep
while sitting up straight.

530
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,000
- I didn't move an inch.
- I see.

531
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,000
I was sitting up straight.
No wrinkles.

532
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,920
I was just resting my eyes.

533
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,520
But I am fully awake now.

534
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,040
There's a video...

535
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,040
Like, you woke up

536
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,320
and smiled at the camera right away.

537
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,560
How did you do that?

538
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,480
Can you teach others to do that, too?

539
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,680
Sure. I'm actually an expert.

540
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,920
These guys are amateurs, honestly.

541
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,280
They're new.

542
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,080
Their acting skills are so bad and stiff.

543
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,240
You should be like....
5, 4, 3, 2, whoosh!

544
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,800
And you could change
your emotions right away.

545
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,840
These guys are unskillful,

546
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,920
but I'm an expert.

547
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,480
I have hundreds of years of experience.

548
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,960
