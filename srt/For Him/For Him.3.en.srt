3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How come you can't join us?

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,680
I heard he's going out with someone new.
That's good for him.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,160
Do you know...you're so cute?

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,080
Cute what?

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,120
What are you actually doing?

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,880
You forgot about that?

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,760
I don't mean a thing to you, Him?

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,880
We're dating, aren't we?

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,320
Why don't you have time for me?

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,760
Blue... You know I'm busy with my family stuff.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,080
Why don't you get to understand me a bit?

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,600
That's what you always say.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,440
Am I even important to you?

16
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,560
Here it is.

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,759
Thank you, Te.

18
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,520
Thanks for coming over.

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,000
Am I doing something wrong?

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Don't blame yourself.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
What if Him doesn't love me anymore?

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,360
What should I do then?

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,760
You still have me.

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,160
I'm not there.

185
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,760
Where are you now?

186
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,920
I'm working.

187
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,880
Send me the location. I'll pick you up!

188
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,160
No need to.

189
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
- But I...
- Just go back home.

190
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,840
No. I wanna see your face!

191
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,920
I told you I would come to see you!

192
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,880
- But...
- Whatever!

193
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,400
I'll wait until you're back!

194
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,760
Don't be childish, Chao.

195
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,760
I miss you, Phai.

196
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,120
Alright, I'm coming.

197
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,200
Bye.

198
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,120
You're going home?

199
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,240
Yes. Do you need help?

200
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,080
No. I'm just confused...

201
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
You usually stay until the shop is closed.

202
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,800
I have to feed my dog at the condo.

203
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,480
I'm leaving. See ya later!

204
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,680
OK. OK.

205
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,280
When did he pet a dog?

206
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,000
What?

207
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,400
Well...I miss you.

208
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,920
Well... Am I a bad guy missing you?

209
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,840
That's too much!

210
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,040
I wanna invite you to watch a movie with me.

211
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,080
That's nonsense.

212
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,520
I really miss you.

213
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,760
After that day, we hadn't met each other at all.

214
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,600
Did you have dinner?

215
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,960
Are you hungry?

216
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm craving you more!!

217
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
But I'm hungry.

218
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,360
I'm ordering food. What do you want?

219
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,720
Whatever, choose one for me.

220
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll eat what you eat.

221
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,240
What are you doing?

222
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
Choose one!

223
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,680
This one!

224
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,560
If you don't stop...

225
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,840
I'll kick you home.

226
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,920
Well...let's watch a movie then...

227
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,720
This one?

228
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,320
Hmm.

229
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,120
You're really hungry?

230
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,200
Let me check!

231
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,800
I've worked all day and
haven't had a bite yet.

232
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,680
I'm, of course, starving.

233
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,960
Hello.

234
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,800
I'm coming right up.

235
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,080
I'll get the food.

236
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,600
Come back quickly!

237
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,760
I miss you so so much!!

238
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,600
[Chao: I already waved you money from the show.]

239
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,960
[Te: Wanna join me at the studio?]

240
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,360
[Chao: What is it?]

241
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,320
[Te: So we can have new songs on stage.]

242
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,640
[Chao: That's not a bad idea.
@Dream @Him What ya think?]

243
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,800
[Dream: Sure. I'm in.]

244
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,200
[Te: Him?]

245
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,080
[Chao: Gone again. Often disappear lately.]

246
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,120
See you at the studio tomorrow.

247
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,640
What time is it?

248
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,840
- Te-chan!
- What the heck!

249
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,800
Finally.

250
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,280
I wanna sing a song so bad!

251
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,720
What about Him?

252
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,600
I don't know him.

253
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
He didn't read the text.

254
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,320
But I'm surprised you're here!

255
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,880
As I said,

256
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,320
I wanna have a new song to perform
when Van calls me.

257
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
We kept playing the same old tracks.

258
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,280
That doesn't sound like you.

259
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,560
Whatever.

260
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,600
No bass for today.

261
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,040
Let's practice the basic ones today.

262
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,560
OK.

263
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,720
I've prepared some songs.

264
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,720
These.

265
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,960
They are new and fun.

266
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,200
Alright.

267
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,200
But...I'm thinking about Blue.

268
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,840
I want him to join us again.

269
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,880
Why are you silent?

270
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,520
You, shut up.

271
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,040
Well, shall we visit Him at his place afterward?

272
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,600
Let's do the rehearsal first.

273
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Cheers!

274
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,880
I'm not familiar with
the way you look at me.

275
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,320
Are you uncomfortable?

276
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm just shy...

277
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,600
Nail, when I'm with you,

278
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,600
I'm so happy.

279
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,440
I feel like myself.

280
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
- Is that true?
- Yes.

281
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,560
It's like being myself again.

282
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,120
But...

283
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,920
I can't give you a title now...

284
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Are you sure? But I think...

285
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,200
a friend with benefits is a title, though.

286
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,800
That's crazy! What did you say!?

287
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,120
Hmm? Isn't that true?

288
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,440
- Well...
- It has a good feeling...

289
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,920
Stop it right there!

290
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,160
- Why? It's a fact.
- No, it's not!

291
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,200
It is. Why can't I say it?

292
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,120
Can't I?

293
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
Are you ticklish?

294
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
Go get the door.

295
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,840
No.

296
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,760
I wanna be with you, just two of us.

297
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,760
I'm not going anywhere!!

298
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,720
Go get the door first!

299
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,240
The neighbor will come
and shout at you!

300
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,240
- I'm not getting it.
- Do it.

301
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,080
If you don't, I'll do it.

302
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,800
Alright, alright. I'll do it.

303
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
What were you doing?
Why didn't you get the door?

304
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,000
Are you ready to be drunk!!?

305
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,680
But I'm not ready. I'm not free now!

306
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,880
But WE ARE!

307
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,080
- Hey.
- Let's get inside.

308
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,960
Drunk, drunk!

309
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,000
You guys, this is Nail.

310
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,760
Nail?

311
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,480
And these are...

312
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,240
Chao, Dream, and...

313
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,000
Te.

314
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,120
These are my friends.

315
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,120
You guys are what?

316
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,080
We're friends.

317
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,560
Are you sure!?

318
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,240
He's flirting with you, right?

319
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,240
I'm just joking!

320
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
I know things well!

321
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,800
We're just kidding!

322
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,680
I'm going to the bathroom.

323
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Chao...that's funny!

324
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!!

325
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,760
Bottles up! Go!

326
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,840
This is what you mean by starting over?

327
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,960
They look identical!

328
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,120
I didn't see Blue in him.

329
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,040
Who's gonna be fooled by that?

330
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,040
Did you tell him that?

331
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,520
- Want me to do that for you?
- Stop!

332
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,480
Why? You're afraid
he'll know the truth...

333
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,320
- that...
- STOP!

334
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,720
Right.

335
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,280
I was the one to blame.

336
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,640
But I have no chance to
live my life after that?

337
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,320
How dare you still live your live?

338
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,400
Huh?

339
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,560
- When Blue...
- You did this 'cause you loved Blue?

340
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,240
- SURE!
- Why?

341
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,680
How dare you did that sh*t to me!?

342
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,520
Huh?

343
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,840
- What are you doing?
- I'll let you know...

344
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,080
Nail, do you know you're my type?

345
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,400
Te, you bastard!

346
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,200
What the f*ck!?

347
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,200
Stop.

348
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,680
Go now! Get out!

349
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,680
GO!

350
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,080
See you around, Nail.

351
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,640
You b*tch!

352
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,480
Sit down.

353
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Are you OK, Him?

354
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,440
I'm so sorry.

355
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,320
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

356
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,000
Te...

357
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,880
I'll take care of this myself.

358
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,360
Nothing to worry about.

359
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,520
I'm going to class now.

360
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,480
See you later.

361
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,960
Bye-bye!

362
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,360
[Te: I'm Te. What are you up to?]

363
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,280
Nail, you ate!

364
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
That guy is showing off his possession

365
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,840
by lending you this big shirt!

366
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,200
Is it Him's?

367
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,200
Or someone else!?

368
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,440
Oops, that's too much!

369
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,680
- I wouldn't ask that if I were you.
- Oopsie!

370
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,120
That's b*tchy, but I like it!

371
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,960
Well, be careful of falling for the owner, OK?

372
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
- What?
- Stop!

373
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,960
Falling in l-l-love!

374
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,680
I like that!

375
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,240
I'll wear a bigger shirt next time!

376
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,720
Nail.

377
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,000
You didn't answer me at all.

378
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,560
I didn't see it.

379
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,360
Well...

380
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,640
I just did.

381
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,360
Shall we go out for a meal then?

382
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,680
No, I have a date.

383
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,360
Nail!

384
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,480
What are you trying to do?

385
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,960
Hope we get a chance
to have a meal together soon.

386
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,400
Stop intervening with my person!

387
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,520
Come on, Him.

388
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,520
[Te: I wanna have dinner with you.]

389
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,679
[Te: Answer me, please.]

390
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,960
Te, what do you wanna talk about?

391
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,360
[Te: I just want to have a meal with you.]

392
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,680
I'm not going.

393
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,160
[Te: Think first, why you answered it so fast?]

394
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,360
That's all?

395
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:19,600
[Te: I told you you're my type.]

396
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,280
I can see...

397
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,120
If you like Him,
I can stop seeing him for you.

398
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,000
[Te: Why did you say that?]

399
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,600
What else can it possibly be?

400
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,200
When...

401
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,280
[Te: Nail, that's ridiculous. We're just friends,

402
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,080
never more than that.]

403
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,240
[Te: But I'm interested in you...]

404
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,240
Don't bring me in.

405
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,880
I'm not part of this.

406
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,520
Nail.

407
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,080
Thank you.

408
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,840
But why?

409
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,280
I remember you like it.

410
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,600
I'm sorry for coming late at night.

411
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,040
Am I disturbing you or something?

412
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,280
Is there anything you wanna say?

413
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,680
I wanna explain.

414
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,680
You wanna hear that from me?

415
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,160
Sure, go ahead.

416
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,360
My ex is Blue.

417
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,760
We dated when we were in
the last year of high school,

418
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,720
around the university time.

419
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:08,800
At that time, Te, Blue, and I
were tutoring together.

420
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,600
So Te and Blue were pretty close to each other.

421
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,040
We were hanging out
and doing stuff together.

422
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,520
One day, Blue left me.

423
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,920
I found out later that Te liked Blue, too.

424
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,680
You mean...?

425
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,560
Te saw me as Blue?

426
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,920
I'm not sure of that.

427
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,520
But for me, you are you.

428
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,840
What are you doing? Are you a kid?

429
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,160
I'd better go home.

430
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,600
Hold on.

431
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,960
It's heavily raining outside.

432
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,040
I think...you should go out tonight.

433
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,640
And...you're afraid of lightning?

434
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,080
No need to say that, though.

435
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,920
Well, stay with me tonight, OK?

436
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,040
Hmm.

437
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,000
Thank you for this.

438
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,560
I know that you like it.

439
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,120
I brought you many.

440
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,800
This scene is reminding me of us.

441
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,880
Which one?

442
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,120
The scene where a man brought a man back home?

443
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:09,440
It's the scene that a man gives
another man a chance to get close

444
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,080
and brings him to his world.

445
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,720
What did you understand about my world?

446
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,720
I learned that
you're a romantic person!

447
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,160
That's it?

448
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,400
You like reading books.

449
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,760
You like B-52.

450
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,360
You like hydrangea.

451
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,400
I wanna know more about
what you like.

452
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,160
Nail, when you're in my room,

453
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,600
you look so charming in my eyes.

454
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
What is it so charming about

455
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,600
reading books and watching series?

456
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,800
I don't know.

457
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,920
I just feel like you're so special.

458
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,920
Just right now when we have no status?

459
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,920
I wanna try dating you for real now.

460
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,680
No need to try. Be my boyfriend.

461
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,520
Hmmm, for the things I said last night...

462
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,400
We're gonna be a couple just for 1 week!

463
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,920
Are you OK with that?

464
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,520
We're a couple now.

465
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,120
This is for my friend.
Do you need to know this, too?

466
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,680
Come here if you want.

467
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,760
Are we still dating?
