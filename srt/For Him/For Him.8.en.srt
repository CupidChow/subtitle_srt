3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,640
It's true that I approached him

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,560
because he looked like Blue.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,640
I don't want to deal
with you guys anymore.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,200
And you're hating me, too?

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,400
If there's anything on your mind,

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,840
you can tell me.

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,720
Just follow your heart.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,640
Blue, stay right here.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,160
Who took you home?

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,040
It's Te, Him's friend.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,560
Are you still messing with them?

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,800
Both Him and Te.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,680
When will you stop dating men?

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,600
What you're doing now
is ruining our family's image.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,560
Have you ever thought
about how people would look at us?

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,880
You're the only son of ours.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,800
You're also taking over
my company in the future.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,640
You won't help your sister do it, huh?

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,840
I told you to study business administration,
but you wouldn't.

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,440
You're only fantasizing
about your foolish dreams.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,600
You've never thought of us at all.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,480
Please, Blue.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
Stop being friends with them.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,800
I... I'm sorry,

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,960
but I love Him.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,000
I won't break up with him.

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,720
If you won't, I'll end it for you

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,320
and send you to study abroad!

31
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,640
Please don't, Dad.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,960
I won't break up with Him.

33
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,080
I love him.

35
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,280
Please don't send me to study abroad.

36
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,560
I want to stay here

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,440
to pursue my dreams with him.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,800
That's nonsense!

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,480
If you won't break up with him,

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,320
I'll ruin that guy's life completely!

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Mom...

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,199
Please help me.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
Please don't let Dad hurt Him.

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,880
Please.

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,840
I love him.

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,920
Don't force me to do it.

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,640
Are you saying I'm forcing you?!

48
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,040
What I'm doing is all for you!!

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,000
Just do as Dad said.

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,920
What he said was the best thing.

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,840
Blue, don't hurt us anymore.

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,880
What you're doing now
is ruining our family's image.

53
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,960
Blue!

54
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
What are you doing?!

55
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,480
Are you a faggot or something?

56
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,480
I didn't raise you to be like this.

57
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,360
- You're a boy!
- Dad!

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,960
Don't wear female clothes!

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
Take it off!

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,680
Take it off.

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,159
Take it off now!

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,760

63
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,000

64

Take it off.

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,720
How will you live growing up like this?

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,159
How can you be part of society?

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,720
Jeez, come here.

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760

72

Come here, then!

73
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,000
What's this?

74
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
Communication arts?

75
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
Quit it. Get a business administration degree.

76
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,560
Are you really dating Him?

77
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,240
Yes, I am.

78
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,000
I raised you to be a man.

79
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,159
Why aren't you?!

80
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,440
Why was I born?

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,800
I only caused trouble and hurt people.

82
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
I'm sorry, Dad,

83
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,720
Mom,

84
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,720
Pink,

85
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,000

86

and Te.

87
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,440
I only caused you guys problems.

88
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,440
I hurt Mom and Dad.

89
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,680
Dear everyone I love,

90
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,880
I'm sorry for what I did.

91
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
I don't regret it at all.

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,120
I love you, and I'm grateful for you,
Mom and Dad.

93
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,360
Thank you for giving me my life
and raising me so well.

94
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
But I'm very tired.

95
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,880
I'm tired of all the pressure

96
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,680
and expectations.

97
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,640
I'm tired of doing what you guys want me to do.

98
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,960
I don't want to keep trying anymore.

99
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm sorry that I can only make it this far.

100
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,360
I can't be who you want me to be.

101
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,960
I apologize.

102
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,960
Him,

103
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm sorry for leaving you like this.

104
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
You're my best friend and lover.

105
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,440
Thank you for everything.

106
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,840
I'm sorry that I won't get to tell you
before I leave

107
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,760
although we made a promise

108
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,159
that we'd live our lives
in our own house one day.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,960
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,840
I really am.

111
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,880

Don't worry about me anymore.

You too, Te.

Hello, Kao. I'm Chao.

186
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,560
Hi.

187
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Is he really a friend?

188
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,520
He really is.

189
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Just for now. After this...

190
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
I found a milk tea shop outside.

191
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,360
Do you want some?

192
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Let's add something sweet to your heart.

193
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,240
Or me coming here is enough?

194
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,840
I'll be right back. Finding something to eat.

195
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,800
Text me if there's anything.

196
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,040
- Okay, Kao.
- Be right back.

197
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,280
Keep going.

198
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
I almost misunderstood you.

199
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,480
Back then, I thought you two were together.

200
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,400
You're just business partners?

201
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,320
You're talking too much.

202
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,320
Phai!

203
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,280
Did you send me your tattoo?

204
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,400
I did. Through your DMs.

205
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,960
Excuse me.

206
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,920
Who are you?
Why do you have his DMs?

207
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,280
Chao, this is Type.

208
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,880
Do you want to know everyone?

209
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,680
What about you? Who are you to Phai?

210
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,360
Type, this is Chao.

211
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,040
He's my friend.

212
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,280
Just for now.

213
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,600
Are you here to get a tattoo?

214
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,480
Yes, I am.

215
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,200
I'm also here to get Phai back.

216
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,040
I don't want to be his ex anymore.

217
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,920
Type.

218
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,120
Chao,

219
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
you said you'd get some milk tea.

220
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Yours is less sugar, right?

221
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
Yes, that's right.

222
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,000
Go now.

223
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,680
Let's go.

224
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,920
Phai, do you know

225
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,359
the meaning of this tattoo?

226
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,960
Do I need to?

227
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,920
It's related to you.

228
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
Do you remember
what we talked about?

229
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,840
Phai, can we please get back together?

230
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,000
Please. I'm begging you.

231
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,800
Type, it's been a long time.

232
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,000
Let the past be the past.

233
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,760
Your milk tea's right here.

234
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,720
Thanks.

235
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,680
Can I get more than that word?

236
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,920
Chao, get out.

237
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm working.

238
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,320
Your favorite drink's still the same.

239
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,720
I want a tattoo.

240
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,520
Let Kao do it for you.

241
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,120
I want you to do it for me.

242
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,600
My schedule's full.

243
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,800
You did it for that guy, Type.

244
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,000
But you won't do it for me.

245
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,320
For real?

246
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,320
Are you going back to him?

247
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,440
Do I need to answer that?

248
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,000
We're not together.

249
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,720
Have you forgotten about that?

250
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Does that mean...

251
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,680
you still have feelings for him?

252
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,560
I won't let you.

253
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,480
You can't do that.

254
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,680
Don't cross the line. It's my life.

255
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,560
You again, Him?

256
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,760
Is something bothering you?

257
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,160
It's not a big deal.

258
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,920
Is it about Nail?

259
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,240
Yes.

260
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,200
Nail accidentally found out about Blue.

261
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,960
I explained everything, though.

262
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,880
Then, why are you making that face?

263
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,640
Well, I'm not sure...

264
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
if Nail has forgiven me.

265
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,400
Please come in.

266
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,800
Madam, Type wants to meet Him.

267
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,480
Hello, Auntie.

268
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,040
Have a seat.

269
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,880
Is everything okay?

270
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,560
It's nothing.

271
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
I just wanted to talk to Him.

272
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,840
You guys can talk here, then.

273
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,840
I'll take Honey to her tutorial class.

274
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,360
Okay.

275
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
Honey.

276
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm ready, Mom.

277
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,880
- Hello.
- Hi.

278
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,480
Him, I'm waiting to eat your cake.

279
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,520
Okay.

280
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,680
Let me talk to Type for a moment.

281
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,760
I'll make one for you right after that.

282
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,600
Fine.

283
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,960
Go to your class, okay?

284
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,560
Let's go, Honey.
Eat the cake later.

285
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
I'll be right back, Him.

286
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Okay. Goodbye.

287
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
Goodbye.

288
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,400
Bye-bye.

289
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,160
What do you wanna talk about?

290
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,160
Well, I need your help.

291
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,120
I want you to help me
get back with Phai.

292
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,520
Honestly,

293
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,520
I don't wanna get involved.

294
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,360
I don't think you can do that.

295
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,520
Chao's your friend, isn't he?

296
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,400
Tell him to stop messing with my boyfriend.

297
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,240
Your ex-boyfriend.

298
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,000
You guys broke up.

299
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,360
Are you...really not helping me?

300
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,280
Good. Fine.

301
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,400
You have chosen your side.

302
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
Hi, Nail.

303
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,800
Hi, Type.

304
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,800
Are you free to talk?

305
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,680
I want to treat you to a meal.

306
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,320
I'm good.

307
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,760
I mean, the client absolutely
loves your shoot with Te.

308
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,120
Let me treat you to a meal.

309
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,560
Okay, fine.

310
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,080
Okay, Nail.

311
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,320
See you around.

312
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,520
What are you trying to do?

313
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,800
Right? What am I trying to do?

314
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,400
Don't mess with Nail.

315
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,640
You have no right to order me.

316
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,760
We're not kids anymore.

317
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,560
You couldn't order me to do anything

318
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,960
just because you were richer.

319
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,040
Keep this in mind.

320
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,800
I'm not the old Type.

321
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,920
Why are you doing this?

322
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,400
I just remember that you like it.

323
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,720
What do you want?

324
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,440
What if...I want us to get back together?

325
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,360
That's weird.

326
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,680
Why? Why now?

327
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,800
I love you.

328
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,360
I miss you, and...

329
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,960
I want to be with you forever.

330
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,920
Please, Phai.

331
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,440
Are you okay...

332
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,320
that I keep our relationship a secret?

333
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
What's wrong, Phai?

334
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm okay, Kao.

335
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm just worried about the assignment.

336
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,120
It's freaking hard.

337
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,480
Really?

338
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,320
I see. It's Drawing.

339
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,080
I got an A.

340
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,480
Let me teach you.

341
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,280
I don't think it's about the assignment.

342
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,360
Are you and Type fighting?

343
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,960
I knew it. That's why
you're not going anywhere together lately.

344
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,560
Come on.

345
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,640
You're lovers. Talk things out.

346
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,360
That's not it, Kao.

347
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,160
Type and I...are not together.

348
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,760
We're just close friends.

349
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,360
Are we just close friends?

350
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,080
Well...

351
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,400
Take it easy.

352
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,280
Excuse me.

353
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,720
Why, Phai?

354
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,960
Why didn't you tell him the truth?

355
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,720
Type, I told you

356
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,040
that I didn't want anyone to know.

357
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,120
If you're not okay with it,
let's break up.

358
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
Wait, Phai.

359
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,840
I've grown up.

360
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,440
I think I'm mature enough

361
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,480
to let you do whatever you want.

362
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,000
All I want is...for you to come back.

363
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,280
Please, Phai.

364
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Phai, where are you? I'm at your shop,
but you're not here.

365
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,240
I miss you so badly.

366
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,680
I'm near the shop.

367
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,720
I'm having a meal.

368
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,400
Cooked-to-order?
I'll be there as soon as possible.

369
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,520
Chao, don't come.

370
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,280
Why?

371
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,640
I'm with Type.

372
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,880
I have to be there even faster, then.
I'll go now.

373
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,600
Chao! Don't!

374
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,360
Did Chao call you?

375
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,840
Let's dig in.

376
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,200
Eat up.

377
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,080
Why didn't you wait for me for lunch?

378
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,120
Chao, don't be silly.

379
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,640
Who did you...have lunch with?

380
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,320
Can you take me to lunch?
I'm hungry.

381
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,080
I have to get back to work.

382
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,520
If you're hungry, go and eat alone.

383
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,280
Phai... I'm hungry.

384
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,600
Chao, don't be headstrong.

385
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,200
Right.

386
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Phai doesn't like a headstrong boy like you.

387
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,080
And...we're back together.

388
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,560
After this, I hope not to see you
messing around with my boyfriend.

389
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,640
I don't believe you.

390
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,440
Who would believe you?

391
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,240
Phai's wise enough not to get back with you.

392
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,280
That's your business.

393
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,640
A boy like you is just his rebound guy.

394
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,840
What do you mean by a boy?

395
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,280
It's you!

396
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,640
Look at you.
Violence is always your solution.

397
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,240
You can't control yourself.

398
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,480
Old stuff remains old.

399
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,640
A new one's always better.

400
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,280
It's newer, younger, and better.

401
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,680
Suit yourself.

402
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,680
Anyway, I'm his actual boyfriend,

403
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,760
not a temporary guy
he's just having fun with.

404
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,280
Hi, Mom.

405
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,199
I have something to say to Nail.

406
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,719
But...

407
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,520
It's okay, Him.

408
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,520
I'll talk to your mom.

409
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,640
You should wait upstairs.

410
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,360
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

411
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,760
What is the relationship
between you and Him?

412
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,600
We're seeing each other.

413
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,280
We're not a couple yet.

414
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Him and I have feelings for each other.

415
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,360
He's happy when he's with me.

416
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,760
I'm also happy when I'm with him.

417
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,600
Do you know about Blue yet?

418
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,520
Yes, I do.

419
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,040
You should know this about Him, too.

420
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Why?

421
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,040
Why isn't it me who died?

422
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,240
Why...

423
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,640
Why did he leave me like this?

424
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,760
Why can't I do anything?

425
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,480
Why...

426
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,720
Why...isn't it me who died?

427
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,360
Him, how can I live without you?

428
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,280
What about your sister?

429
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,480
I have no one else but you.

430
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,840
Will you leave us?

431
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,000
I can't live like this.

432
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,960
I can't take it anymore.

433
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,520
I'll take you to see a doctor.

434
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,200
I can't...

435
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,160
- Go see a doctor with me.
- I can't take it...

436
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,760
I can't live like this.

437
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,160
Why... Why isn't it me?

438
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,640
Now, he's gotten so much better.

439
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,240
However, he still needs to go to his appointments.

440
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,200
I want you to understand how hurt he was.

441
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,920
Okay.

442
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,280
I know he has to go see a doctor.

443
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,880
I know what Him's been through.

444
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,160
You don't have to worry.

445
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,360
That means...he really trusts you.

446
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,000
Thanks a lot, Nail.

447
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,480
Him's gotten so much better
because you're by his side.

448
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,840
Alright, you should go upstairs now.

449
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,360
He's probably thinking
I'm doing something to you.

450
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,720
Okay. Please excuse me, then.

451
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,920
Thank you so much, Mom.

452
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,440
Nail.

453
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,600
What did Mom say?

454
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,560
Sit down.

455
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,160
Did she say anything bad?

456
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,160
She's just worried about you.

457
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,880
Do you know
that she loves you so much?

458
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,200
I do.

459
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,320
I know.

460
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,800
I know she's very worried about me.

461
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm also worried about you.

462
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,800
I don't want to hurt you ever again.

463
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,800
I have something for you.

464
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,400
Will it smell good?

465
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,160
I was looking around,

466
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,840
and I thought this one would suit you.

467
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,840
It smells good.

468
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,240
It feels relaxing, too.

469
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,200
Then...

470
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,720
I think...

471
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,680
I can make you feel
even more relaxed.

472
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,720
What is it? I'm so curious.

473
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,760
From now on, I'm all yours.

474
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,080
I love you, Phai.

475
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,720
Do you ever love me?

476
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,800
Chao? We're just friends.

477
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,400
It's nothing.

478
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,000
Let me give you a ride today.

479
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,240
No need.

480
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,400
Stop arguing.

481
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,400
If I don't give it my all now,

482
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,920
how will I beat him?

483
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,880
Let's just be what we are now.
