4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,420
I'm sorry for everything.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,100
All I did was be mad at you,

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,460
and it ruined everything.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,820
I'm sorry, too.

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,780
From now on,
let's be friends again like we were, Te.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,060
Can I take a break from you for a while?

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,180
But he doesn't want to see me.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,100
Are you blind?

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,420
He's head over heels in love with you.

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,700
Chao, about being your boyfriend,
can we not hurry?

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,780
I'm scared I'll get hurt.

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,700
I'll prove it to you
and show you that I love you

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,020
and that I won't hurt you.

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,420
Mm, let's give it a try, then.

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,300
If you're not into me,
don't get my hopes up.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,940
I'm not.

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,260
I just want to open up to you.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,380
I'm so lucky to meet you.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,460
I love you, Him.

23
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,860
After you said that,

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,260
all of me...has become all yours.

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,060
You've used up lots of energy.

26
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,340
Let me see.

27
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,900
You look so run-down.

28
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,540
Come here.

29
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,140
What is it?

30
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,700
I'll apply it for you.

31
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,740
Ouch, it's cold.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,400
How does it feel?

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,600
It feels so relaxing.

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,140
If you're gonna stare at me like that,
why don't you just eat me up?

35
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,660
May I?

36
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,180
If you want to, I'm fine with that.

37
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,510
Are you hungry?

38
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,380
Mm, I am.

39
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,180
What do you wanna eat? An omelet?

40
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,420
Okay.

41

48

That's not what I mean by 'try'.

94

you wouldn't open up.

95

to a meal, aren't you?

97

Whoa, with that look,

108
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,860
I can lose my life, Phai.

109

Then, let's do it.

110
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,820
Then, we have to be together first,

111
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,140

I'm opening up to someone I like.

122
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,620

138

139
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,660

Do you like it?

148
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,280
You didn't paint them yourself, for sure.

149

Yeah, Him did.

150
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,820

154
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,900
Did I miss something?

155
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,140
I guess.

156
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,380
We're seeing each other.

157
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,780
Still missing something?

158
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,260
- That's harsh!
- That's harsh!!

159
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,700
Right. How about this?

160
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,820
Next week, it's a school break.

161
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,420
I'll be free for 3 days.
Should we go on a trip together?

162
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,620
- Yes! What are you waiting for?!
- Yes! What are you waiting for?!

163
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,230
Of course.

164
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,780
Sounds great.
Somsom can go there and relax.

165

Are you going on a trip or a date?

166

Nail, ask Him and his friends
to come with us.

167
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,020
It'd be fun with lots of people.

168
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,100
He must go with his boyfriend.

169
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,540
What about you?
Don't you wanna go with that guy?

170
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,420
Which guy?

171
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,900

172

It's Dream.

173
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,380
They always have breakfast together.

174
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,260

175
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
It's really him.

176
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,980
What do you mean?

177
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,380
- Your voice sounds suspicious.
- Just ask them to come with us.

178
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,020
Fine, it's nothing between you.

179
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,100
But...

180
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,770
I'm fed up.

181
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,460
Why is there no one
hitting on a pretty girl like me?

182
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,860
Right! Are we too hot?

183
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,940
You're too bold.

184
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,500
You may not be pretty at all.

185
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,780
Keep your mouth shut.

186
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,340
- Let's sit down.
- I am pretty.

187
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,420
- Right!
- Right!!

188
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,620
- We're the prettiest!
- We are!

189
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,740
During the school break,
are you going anywhere?

190
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,820
I don't have a plan yet.
Where are you going?

191
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,180
My friends want to go camping.

192
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,980
We still don't know where to go, though.

193
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,500
Well, they want me to ask you
and your friends to come together.

194
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,220
They said it would be fun
with lots of people.

195
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,140
I'll tell them.

196
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,020
Nail...

197
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,460
I have a surprise for you tonight.

198
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,780
Walk slowly.

199
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,340
Careful.

200
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,380
Stop.

201
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,660
Don't open your eyes just yet.

202
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,020
You may open your eyes.

203
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,460
I'm sorry for what I did.

204
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,340
I'm sorry for giving you a lot of hard times.

205
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,820
Thank you...

206
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,180
for the love you give me.

207
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,060
From now on, I promise

208
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,260
that I'll take care of you
and not hurt you ever again.

209
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,500
Here's to celebrate
the four-month anniversary of our first meeting.

210
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,780
I don't know if you'll like it or not,

211
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,700
but I put in a lot of effort
to do this for you.

212
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,180
What I want the most from you

213
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,220
is for you to be happy.

214
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,060
I love you, Him.

215
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,220
I'm happy that we made it until today,

216
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,380
that I'm with you

217
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,180
and get to love you.

218
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,580
Thank you for being my love.

219
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,180
You're gorgeous.

220
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,940
What a sweet talker.

221
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,340
Can I?

222
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,220
Oh, my God!!

223
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,180
Men!! They're men!!

224
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,500
What are we calling this trip?

225
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,660
A group of stars?

226
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,900
- That's so old-fashioned.
- So outdated.

227
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,500
I think this name sounds better.

228
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,220
"The Aces of Stars."

229
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,460
The ace, as in Acer, the electronics firm?

230
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,020
What's with her?

231
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,300
Do we need a name for that?

232
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,220
Yes, so that you can use it in your caption.

233
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,340
So outdated.

234
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,100
Right!

235
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,380
Can I bring my boyfriend, too?

236
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,100
Boyfriend?

237
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,060
It's Phai.

238
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,980
I'm blushing.

239
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,300
Well, ask Phai to come. It'll be fun.

240
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,020
Alright, we're going glamping.
It's gonna be chill.

241
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,500
As for the food, I'll take care of it.

242
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,100
So, let's call this trip

243
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,900
"Lovely Couples During A School Break."

244
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,300
- Sounds great?
- Yes!

245
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,380
Jeez, Som. That name is only for you.

246
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,700
How about not having a fixed name?

247
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,900
It's up to all of you.

248
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,190
That's nice!

249
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,060
What a buzzkiller.

250
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,500
Well, that's settled then.

251
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,060
See you tomorrow.

252
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,060
Don't be late!

253
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,860
I won't!

254
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,340
I've never been late!
You always come the latest!

255
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,860
Pick me up.

256
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,180
Why are you staring?

257
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,460
I'm getting beautiful.

258
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,660
I'm staring at my beautiful boyfriend.

259
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,820
On this trip, we haven't spent
much time alone together.

260
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,460
Why?

261
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,260
It's good, though.

262
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,300
We're always with our friends.

263
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,220
No.

264
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,340
I think this trip is a good thing.

265
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,100
I get to be with my friends

266
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,500
and my boyfriend.

267
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,670
That's nice.

268
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,340
Then, my beautiful boyfriend,

269
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,260
let this drink make you even more beautiful.

270
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,380
Thank you.

271
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,699
It's good.

272
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,860
You look beautiful

273
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,940
even while drinking.

274
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,670
You know that?

275
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,780
What beautiful?

276
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,620
What's that?

277
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,820
Hey!

278
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,500
[A month later]

279
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,980
The semester just started,
but we already have lots of tasks to do.

280
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,140
There's no point talking about it.

281
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,020
Anyway, tell me when you'll do the report.

282
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,860
I'll tell Pae and Somsom, too.

283
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,420
Those two are inseparable.

284
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,700
I've never seen them for a while now.

285
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,620
Anyway, I couldn't see
those two being together.

286
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,900
It confuses me sometimes.

287
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,060
People who don't get along
are always the perfect match.

288
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,900
Right. It's great that they're in love.

289
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,180
What about you?

290
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,540
How are things going with Dream?

291
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,820
What? It's nothing!

292
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,140
Don't root for us.

293
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,820
- Jeez...
- What?!

294
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,820
Right! When will we do the interview with Phai?

295
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,700
I made an appointment with him next Sunday.

296
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,500
I'm getting a tattoo, too.

297
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,440
You're getting a tattoo?

298
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,260
Yeah, why?

299
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,220
Jeez! You'll become even hotter!

300
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,060
Him must be so worried.

301
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,340
Have you thought this through?
Getting a tattoo?

302
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,460
Yes, for a long time now.

303
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,980
I gained more confidence
after talking to Phai several times.

304
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,340
I want to get one, too, but I'm scared.

305
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,820
Just open up.

306
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,540
Your body is yours.

307
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,700
That's true.

308
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,500
So, does Him know?

309
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,260
He doesn't. I want it to be a surprise.

310
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,100
Jeez! That's so cool.

311
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,900
He must be head over heels
in love with you,

312
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,940
and you two must be so clingy.

313
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,420
What clingy?

314
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,820
Your boyfriend's here.

315
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,340
- Don't spill the beans.
- Okay!

316
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,960
Are we leaving now?

317
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,940
- I'll leave.
- Okay.

318
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,340
Chaochom, Dream asked me to tell you

319
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,340
that he's waiting in his car
near the building.

320
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,980
What? Why did he ask you to do that?

321
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:41,380
[If you don't wanna be embarrassed,
get in the car]

322
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,900
Nail, I'm leaving.

323
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,380
Bye-bye.

324
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,580
- Jeez, you're leaving 'cause a guy texted you!
- What?

325
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,700
What? No! I was about to leave!

326
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,420
- What? I'll go now.
- Have a safe ride.

327
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,820
Yeah. Bye-bye!

328
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,060
What?

329
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,980
What did my chef make for dinner?

330
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,420
Spaghetti with bacon
and dried chili. Your favorite.

331
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,260
It looks good.

332
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,250
Shall we dig in?

333
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,780
I mean, the spaghetti.

334
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,540
Is everything okay?

335
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,380
Well...

336
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,020
I have an appointment with Phai tomorrow.

337
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,940
An appointment? For a meal?

338
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,820
Yes, kinda.

339
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,140
Mm.

340
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,180
Are you hiding something from me?

341
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,940
No.

342
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,180
I'm just telling you.

343
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,780
Can I give you a ride, then?

344
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,940
Okay. Fine. Let's do that.

345
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,740
Okay.

346
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,940
Let's dig in.

347
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,020
Don't disturb me. I'm working.

348
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,860
Look. Nail's here.

349
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
Chao...

350
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,900
I won't say a thing.

351
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,260
My lips are sealed.

352
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,420
Don't worry, Nail.

353
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,500
No need to be that serious.

354
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,340
Why are you getting a tattoo?

355
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,340
I've been thinking about it for a while.

356
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,860
I want to get this tattoo because I love it.

357
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,140
I saw the tattoo you sent me.

358
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,300
You have good taste.

359
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,780
So, are you ready?

360
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,690
I am.

361
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,180
Okay, you may go and wait in the room.

362
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,820
I'll be there after printing out the tattoo.

363
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,500
Okay.

364
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,220
Look at you. You're looking like a sad dog.

365
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,140
Look at you. You talked to Nail so nicely.

366
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,420
And?

367
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,300
I'm jealous.

368
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,420
Don't be silly.

369
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,620
I'm going to work.

370
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,500
Don't be mad. I'll be right back.

371
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,860
You can do it, Phai!

372
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,180
Nail...

373
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,020
What's wrong?

374
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,420
You look a bit tired today.

375
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,460
I have something to tell you.

376
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,460
What is it?

377
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,020
I just got a tattoo.

378
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,860
A tattoo?

379
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,220
You're not shocked?

380
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,580
Why would I? You just got a tattoo.

381
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,740
I wanted to surprise you.

382
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,420
You did.

383
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,940
Did it hurt?

384
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,540
What is your tattoo?

385
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:45,620
It didn't hurt at all.

386
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,260
Phai did it so gently.

387
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,700
What's my tattoo?

388
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,060
Do you wanna see?

389
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,820
Of course, I do.

390
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,460
Where is it?

391
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,100
I want to see it now.

392
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,260
Then...

393
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,460
Take it off.

394
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,740
Where is it?

395
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,140
I can't see it clearly.

396
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:00,820
Can I take your pants off?

397
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,460
Where is it? Let me see.

398
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,020
It's not fair.

399
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,980
I'm all naked,

400
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,020
but you're still fully dressed.

401
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,060
Is this alright?

402
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,660
Do you wanna see it now?

403
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,780
Yes, I want to see it so badly.

404
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,260
Now, I'm all yours, Him.

405
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,780
I'm also all yours, Nail.
