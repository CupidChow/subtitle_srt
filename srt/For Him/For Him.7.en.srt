Hello, Nail.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,160
Why do you look...

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,200
I want to have Blue's cake,

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,920
and I want to see him.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,840
Why did you do that to Blue?

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,520
You want to do this, huh?

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,080
It's my turn now, Him.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,840
Guys!

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,680
The outdoor cinema event is coming.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,440
I want you guys to brainstorm ideas
for holding the event.

11
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,200
Hey, look at Nail.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,120
- I feel bad for him.
- Yeah.

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,800
Girl, should we just go
and yell at that guy who hurts him?

14
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,039
- Shall we?
- Sure.

15
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,840
Let's just do it.
How could he hurt our friend like this?

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
For real.

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,960
Let's just berate him.

18
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,880
Make him feel mortified!

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,720
Hey.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,160
You're so good at being nosy.

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,280
Pae!

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,400
Guys, pay attention.

23
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,479
It's tiring talking to a wall.

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,800
Pay attention.

25
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,720
Even if this is our first discussion,

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,720
I want you to brainstorm ideas
for the cinema event.

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,079
Drop your phones and work.

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,960
I can't think of anything.

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,040
- You, Somsom?
- Transformermaid?

30
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
- I'm a mermaid.
- It's Transformers.

59

Sorry. Couldn't see it.

that I approached him
because he looked like Blue.

62
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
But after I got to know him,

63
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,560
he's nothing like Blue.

64
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,080
Instead of stepping out,

65
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,200
I fell for him.

66
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,360
We're together.

67
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160

68
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,520
not for looking like Blue.

69
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,440
Then, tell him.

70
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,840
Ask him back.
Don't let him misunderstand you.

71
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
Right.

72
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,080
He's probably so sad right now.

73
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,200
Go and tell him the truth now.

79
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,760
I misunderstood.

80

Don't think too much.

stay sad for too long.

Did you break up?

with you guys anymore.

and you're hating me, too?

99

What's wrong? Why do you look so upset?

106
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,880
It's Him. He makes it hard for me
to approach Nail.

119
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,960

120
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,840
that you guys are having a crush
on the same person again. Is that right?

121

You're like my brothers,

127
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,120
I'll leave.

128
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,240

129
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,800
Come on. Easy.

130
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,000
I have a plan.

131
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,760

134
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,480
A place around here.

135
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,680
You're telling me this time.

136
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,040
It's not your ex, is it?

137
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,000

138
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,760
Then...

139
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,160
Can I join you?

140
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,880
That way, I'll get to know your friend.

141
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,080

142
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,840

Well, Nail and my friend are fighting.

147
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,960
We aren't.

148
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,920
We just have nothing
to do with each other anymore.

149
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,880
That was pretty harsh, Nail.

150
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,760
If he treated you badly,
it's good that you stopped meeting him.

151
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,160
That was harsh, too, Phai.

152
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,840
Let's not talk about that and just eat.

153
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Nail,

154
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,400
if there's anything on your mind,
you can tell me.

155
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,880
I'm not really fine, Phai.

156
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,920
But I'm okay.

157
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,600
If you can't take it anymore,
don't force it.

158
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,400
Just follow your heart.

159
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,920
I don't want to feel anything.

160
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,720
Is it that bad? I understand you.

161
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm confused.

162
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,560
I don't want to think of him,

163
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,280
but I always do.

164
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,440
You're confused
because you have feelings for my friend, right?

165
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,360
Come on, that was just my guess.

166
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,640
To be in love, only love...

167
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,960
is not enough.

168
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,280
You have to talk, listen,

169
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
and understand,

170
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
and you'll work it out.

171
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,840
That's right.
You should listen to him first.

172
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,320
You don't have to, though.

173
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,520
You know what, Phai?

174
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,080
I've never experienced a good relationship.

175
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,640
Until now,

176
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,600
I have no faith in love anymore.

177
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,120
Love isn't a bad thing.

178
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,000
You just met bad people.

179
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,360
But...my friend's a nice person.

180
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,600
I am, too.

181
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,400
I'll stop talking.

182
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,800
You guys are so cute together.

183
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,520
He is annoying.

184
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,480
Are we cute together?

185
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,840
I'm blushing.

186
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,560
Let's just dig in.

187
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,040
- Te.
- Yes?

188
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,840
Can you post an Instagram Story with Nail?

189
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,600
The client wants you to promote the brand.

190
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,760
Sure.

191
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,440
Tell me when you finish.

192
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,320
I'll call Him.

193
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Yes.

194
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,560
Just a moment.

195
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,960
Nail, can you post a Story with me?

196
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,839
Hello.

197
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,599
Hello, Him. What are you doing?

198
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,599
Why did you call me?

199
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,000
Nothing. I'm working,

200
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,600
and I saw Nail and Te together.

201
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,680
Where are you?

202
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I have to go now.

203
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
Just check out Te's Story.

204
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,600
I have to work.

205
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,360
The lighting, is it good?

206
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,840
Are you okay?

207
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,760
I am.

208
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,880
We're ready.

209
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,560
Okay, you can go in.

210
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,600
You can do it.

211
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,280
Are you okay?

212
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,800
I'm fine.

213
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,080
Hey, Him. Where were you here?

214
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,680
Have your arms linked.

215
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
Just like that.

216
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,440
They can be closer. Te,

217
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,840
wrap your arm around his waist.

218
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,280
Just like that. Good.

219
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,680
Relax, Nail.

220
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,720
Keep smiling.

221
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Nice.

222
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,240
Good.

223
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,040
That one's nice.

224
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,280
Thank you.

225
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,080
Thank you, everyone.

226
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,000
Please excuse me.

227
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,520
Thank you.

228
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,440
Thank you.

229
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,840
Thank you, Type,
for asking me to do this job.

230
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
Thank you, too.

231
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,280
Let's work with each other again next time.

232
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,280
Sure.

233
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,680
See you.

234
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,120
Nail.

235
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,080
Let me give you a lift.

236
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,600
No.

237
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,960
I can go home myself.

238
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,080
Nail,

239
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,200
are you tired?

240
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,800
Do you want me to take you home?

241
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,640
No.

242
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,120
I'll do that.

243
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,840
Piss off.

244
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,600
- I can take care of Nail.
- Oh, yeah?

245
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,080
Did you ask Nail about that?

246
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,640
Stop messing with me.

247
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,120
Him...

248
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,880
Have you talked to Nail?

249
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,560
He wouldn't give me a chance.

250
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
He's really harsh.

251
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,880
I don't know...what to do.

252
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,760
But I do.

253
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
What?

254
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,560
You should flatter his close friends.

255
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,360
I just know that...
Nail's close to my future boyfriend.

256
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,120
Future boyfriend?

257
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
Don't crush my hopes.

258
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,080
Listen.

259
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,920
We have to ask my future boyfriend
to help us.

260
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm blushing by saying that.

261
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,880
Hey, don't be silly.

262
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,840
Fine, I'll handle it.

263
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,920
Whoa, you changed so fast.

264
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,760
I couldn't catch up!

265
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,960
I'm blushing.

266
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,160
Oh, hi, Phai.

267
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,120
Why do you know Phai?

268
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,160
You told me you'd help me reconcile with Nail.

269
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,440
Fine, we'll talk about this later.

270
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,000
Phai, babe...

271
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,160
Do you know Him?

272
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,600
Then...

273
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,960
Can you help him reconcile with Nail?

274
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,480
No.

275
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,320
Come on, babe. That was so harsh.

276
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,640
I was bragging that I could help.

277
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,120
I won't help him.

278
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,440
Babe... Please.

279
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,240
No!

280
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,680
Aren't you going to help my friend?

281
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,840
If you won't, nobody can help him.

282
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,120
If you can't do anything
without anyone's help,

283
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,760
don't do it.

284
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,920
Let Nail meet someone better.

285
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,440
Phai,

286
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,000
I just want him to let me explain.

287
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,480
Nail's not someone who doesn't listen.

288
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,400
But he won't...even look at me.

289
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,560
I don't think I can help you.

290
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,840
You should seek help from someone else.

291
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,120
Nail's a good person.

292
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,440
Don't take advantage of him.

293
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
You're here again,

294
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,280
looking like dogs begging for food.

295
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Annoying.

296
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,160
Jeez, watch your mouth.

297
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,680
Why? What's wrong?

298
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Stop it, Dream.

299
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,760
We need her help.

300
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,680
Don't upset her.

301
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,520
Chaochom, can I talk to you?

302
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,280
I always say no,

303
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,920
and you're still asking.

304
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,800
Well, in case you're free today.

305
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,400
Please.

306
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,840
Say what you wanna say.

307
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,760
I'm working. Be quick.

308
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,640
I want to explain everything to Nail,

309
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,880
but he won't give me a chance.

310
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,080
Can you help me with that?

311
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,560
I don't want to have a hand in it.

312
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,280
Please help me. I'm begging you.

313
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,000
I want him to at least listen to my explanation.

314
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,560
Whatever happens after that,

315
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm fine with all the consequences.

316
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,840
I trust you,

317
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,640
so I'm helping you to reconcile with Nail.

318
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,320
What, girl?

319
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,480
Why do you trust him?

320
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,160
I saw you chase him away the other day.

321
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,000
Like we were some dogs.

322
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,240
We're humans.

323
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,880
Aren't you a dog?

324
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,240
Hey.

325
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,760
When will I know why you trust him?

326
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,320
I'm confused. Why are you fighting?

327
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,040
I trust him

328
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,960
because I can see his sincerity.

329
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,360
He could do everything
to give Nail his explanation.

330
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,880
What about you?

331
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,320
Why are you helping him?

332
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,560
Just like you.

333
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,800
Thank you so much, everyone.

334
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,800
And? What should we do?

335
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,560
Let's start with saying sorry.

336
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,960
Like, give him a bouquet.

337
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,720
Sounds great.

338
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,120
A bouquet won't be enough.

339
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,840
A bouquet, a gift,

340
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
and a sweet message would work.

341
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,680
Sounds perfect!

342
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,880
Right, let's find it.

343
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,120
What if he won't listen?
What should we do?

344
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,760
We must make him listen.

345
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,400
If he walks away, just yell

346
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,560
and chase him.

347
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,800
- What?
- What? What's wrong with you?

348
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,560
What did that mean?

349
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
Where are you guys?

350
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm in the parking lot.

351
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,480
No one's here.

352
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,320
Stop!

353
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,360
Stop right there!

354
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,760
It's me.

355
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,920
Why are you doing this?

356
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,160
I want to explain everything to you.

357
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,080
I want to reconcile with you.

358
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,120
May you please give me a chance?

359
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,000
Nail...

360
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,080
Do whatever you want.

361
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,120
Then, please allow me to ask you back!

362
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,200
Do you know about Blue yet?

363
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,040
I'm not anyone's replacement.

364
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,720
When will you realize?!

365
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,200
All I want is...for you to come back.

366
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,200
Are you going back to him?

367
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,680
We're not together.

368
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,680
Have you forgotten about that?

369
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,120
Hi, Nail.

370
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,080
What are you doing?

371
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,880
I'm not the old Type.

372
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,760
He'll walk in,

373
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,400
and you'll say your dialogue.

374
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,440
Oh, you're here?

375
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,840
Hi.

376
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,639
I'm gonna be honest.

377
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,120
I called you guys here to talk things out.

378
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,960
You guys are friends.

379
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,400
Just talk things out.

380
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,600
Camera. Slate.

381
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,280
4, 3, 2...

382
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,199
Alright.

383
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,480
What?

384
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,320
You wanna do it?

385
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,159
You go first.

386
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,120
- Say it.
- Type was in that scene.

387
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,920
- Right.
- How was it?

388
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,040
What should I say?

389
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,960
He wanted Te and Him to talk things out.

390
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,880
Turned out it didn't help.

391
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,000
They hated each other even more

392
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,320
and fought harder.

393
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,440
He wanted them to talk things out.

394
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,720
- Right?
- That's right.

395
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,640
Type just wanted them to sit and talk.

396
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,480
- Turned out...
- It didn't help.

397
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,920
- It got even worse.
- Right.

398
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,760
Exactly.

399
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,120
- How do you feel?
- How do I feel?

400
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,280
Well, I'm fine. It's fun.

401
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,920
I don't get to film with Ku often.

402
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,240
Right, so I was a bit tense.

403
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,800
- What about Ku?
- He's great.

404
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
He suits his character, a villain.
I also do.

405
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,760
Was that a spoiler?

406
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,600
I knew what to do in that scene
after just a single nod.

407
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,960
Let's take a look at that.

408
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,920
They finished their scenes in the morning.
They were so energetic.

409
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
It took an hour for them to practice one scene.

410
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,440
- What's up? Can you tell us...
- Sure.

411
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,040
about the scene you took an hour to practice?

412
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,320
♫Happy birth...♫

413
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,080
No, sing it how you practiced it.

414
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,840
- What?
- With the...

415
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,440
- With the chorus and everything.
- I see.

416
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,320
- You two.
- Mine was a high pitch.

417
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,320
His is a low one.

418
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,880
We've been practicing it since we were five.

419
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,840
- What?
- Show us.

420
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,000
Sing like a choir.

421
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,680
♫Happy birthday to you♫

422
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,720
♫Happy birthday to you♫

423
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,960
♫Happy birthday, happy birthday♫

424
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,280
More vibrato.

425
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:34,720
- ♫Happy birthday to...♫
- ♫To you♫

426
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,720
He was singing.

427
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,480
- He was...chanting.
- What?

428
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,960
Happy birthday to you.

429
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,440
We need both high and low voices.

430
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,680
Oh, yeah?

431
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Then, you'll sing at the normal pitch.

432
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,800
And it'll be perfect.

433
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,320
When composing songs, there'll be...

434
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,720
Different voice ranges.

435
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,680
- Ranges?
- There are different keys.

436
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,240
- So, overall, it's perfect.
- But both of you didn't sound right.

437
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,600
It was the first one.

438
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,800
- It was the first one.
- He was trying to pull it off.

439
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,840
When you were hanging out in the yard...

440
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,320
We sang Dew and Tor's song.

441
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,720
- He sang really well.
- It's for Nail and Him.

442
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,160
I was just mumbling.

443
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,640
- I heard that...
- What?

444
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,160
I heard that you only knew one verse.

445
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
- That's right.
- And you kept singing it.

446
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,960
That's right.
We were just looking at one another.

447
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,200
I also didn't know what chords to play.

448
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,320
He was just pretending.

449
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,720
I just played how I thought it would work.

450
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
I kept repeating a few chords.

451
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,680
We were looking at one another.

452
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,720
- It was fine.
- It was.

453
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,360
- There was nothing wrong.
- It was fun.

454
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,560
- How do you feel about today?
- Fun.

455
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,480
I'm always happy when shooting.

456
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,240
- I'm happy.
- I see. What about you, Tong?

457
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,160
I'm happy all day.

458
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,160
They've been so energetic
since the morning.

459
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,120
- Because...
- We had to shoot in the morning.

460
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,520
We had to shoot the very first scenes.

461
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,880
I saw that you had to act in 10 scenes.

462
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,800
- You weren't like this. You too, Ryan.
- Right.

463
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,120
When I have to play in many scenes, I'll be so quiet.

464
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,520
He'll keep memorizing the dialogue like this.

465
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,040
You were a different person.

466
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,520
Well, please stay tuned to see the next EP.

467
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,320
- See you.
- Please check it out.

468
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,240
- Please.
- Please!

469
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,720
It was fun, obviously.

470
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,040
- How was your meeting?
- The class president was so fierce.

471
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,800
Wasn't he?

472
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,320
- I don't like him.
- He even yelled at us.

473
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,240
I felt offended.

474
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,240
- The class president...
- I like him a lot.

475
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
You like fierce guys?

476
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,480
I do. I like fierce guys.

477
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,040
I want to be their good girl.

478
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,480
What ideas did you give him?

479
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,640
Some movies for the event.

480
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,800
- Masked Rider...
- Here's the class president.

481
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,120
And Transformermaid...

482
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,520
How did you feel? Excited?

483
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,840
- They were talking about you.
- The class president...

484
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,840
- He repeated his dialogue 10 times.
- He was so fierce.

485
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,880
- Don't blame him!
- Don't bully him!

486
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,520
If it was your first series,

487
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,360
- would you be able to say such a long dialogue?
- It's not his first series.

488
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,280
Period.

489
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,160
Don't talk to him like that.

490
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,680
To be a class president and speak alone,

491
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
it's fine to make mistakes

492
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,840
- because everyone would look at you.
- He was fierce.

493
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,720
- He was.
- Yes.

494
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,840
- He was determined.
- He had to be fierce.

495
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,040
He was working hard. Don't insult him.

496
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,880
It's fine.

497
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,960
- It's just 20 takes.
- She's the only one doing it.

498
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,920
You can't take it back.
I heard everything.

499
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,520
You're so talented!

500
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,280
- About what you said...
- Just kidding!

501
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,720
- Oh, yeah?
- Let them clear things up.

502
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,320
- You're so good.
- Fine, ma'am.

503
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,720
Okay, ma'am.

504
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,120
Got it.

505
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,560
You believe her?

506
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,160
- Sorry?
- Can you trust her?

507
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,280
I can't.

508
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,200
Look at that old woman.
She can't be trusted.

509
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,240
Okay. Very good. Very well.

510
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,320
Good job!

511
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,840
Very good!

512
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,680
Guys, pay attention.

513
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,040
- And I'll turn to this side.
- Act like you are in the middle of a conversation.

514
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,040
Chaochom, turn to the front.

515
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,480
Drop your phones and work!

516
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,440
Just a short break.

517
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,720
- Stop please!
- The camera's out of battery. Just a minute.

518
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,040
Almost!

519
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,120
Pae, turn to the back.

520
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,520
You're so good at being nosy, huh?

521
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,880
- Pae!
- Pae!!

522
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,720
Drop your phones!

523
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,920
- I won't!
- You won't?!

524
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
You three, pay attention.

525
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,520
There's going to be
an outdoor cinema event.

526
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,240
It's going to be held soon.

527
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,280
You can continue now.

528
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,560
Guys, pay attention to me.

529
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,120
It's hard talking to a wall.

530
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,960
Even if this is our first discussion,

531
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,600
it's important

532
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,640
for our event to turn out well.

533
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,360
So, I want you guys to brainstorm...

534
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,720
What's wrong, Him? You can tell me.

535
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,160
I'm here for you.

536
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,240
What was that again?

537
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,880
Where should I sit?

538
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,640
Right. What's wrong?

539
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,120
Hey, be quick.

540
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,320
Hello.

541
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,280
It's been too long.

542
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,520
Him's not here yet.

543
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,200
Hurry. We've been waiting for too long.

544
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's been too long.

545
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,000
Is that fur real?

546
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,840
Is that dog's hair?

547
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,640
- It's real!
- Show us how to wear it.

548
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,640
Don't get a girlfriend like me, then.

549
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,600
It needs to be washed, though.

550
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,240
- It's the color.
- Boy...

551
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,920
It's this color!

552
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,120
This chair's not in the frame, right?

553
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,600
Yeah.

554
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,200
Walk together, but turn one-by-one.

555
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,240
Let's go.

556
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,600
You have to watch this show first.

557
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,520
And... Yes.

558
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,880
Don't let our friend
stay sad for too long.

559
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,560
If Nail moves on,
you won't have a chance to get him back.

560
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,080
- What did you say?
- If Nail moves on...

561
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,240
If Nail moves on,
you won't have a chance to get him back.

562
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,680
I told her to build up her emotions,
but she wouldn't.

563
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,160
So cute! Cute!

564
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,240
It's like I'm graduating.
My makeup's so heavy.

565
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,800
It's a graduation look.
It's how I gain my energy.

566
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,680
You're getting a doctorate degree, then.

567
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,080
Right, look at her.

568
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,720
- Yeah...
- Look.

569
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,120
You've used all of their lipstick.

570
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,800
Cut five. Take one.

571
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,960
Action.

572
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,120
Reconcile with Nail, Him.

573
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,840
If Nail moves on,
you won't have a chance to get him back.

574
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,720
- 3, 2, 1...
- If Nail moves on...

575
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,560
Action.

576
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,440
If Nail moves on,
you won't have a chance to get him back.

577
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,920
Let's go, girls.
