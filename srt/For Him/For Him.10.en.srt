when they're free.

178

00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,280
It's nothing.

187
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,480
I just ran into him.

188
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,600
Where?

189
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,400
After I got off work at the club.

190
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,760
And?

191
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,800
And it's nothing.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,960
Well, he was very drunk,

193
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,400
so I offered him a place to sleep.

194
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,240
That's all.

195
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,640
I didn't say anything, though.

196
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,320
And did you enjoy eating
the porridge together?

197
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,200
Well, yes.

198
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,960
Come on, Nail.

199
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
I just felt bad for him,

200
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,080
so I made him some porridge!

201
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,200
For real?!

202
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,960
It's really nothing!

203
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,520
Trust me!

204
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,520
My question was nothing,

205
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,000
but you had a guilty conscience!

206
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,800
Did you tease me?!

207
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
Nope.

208
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,080
You just let it slip on your own!

209
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
Wait for me.

210
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Chaochom!

211
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,880
[Miss you]

212
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,840
[You're the only one I'm thinking of]

213
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,680
[You don't have to reply]

214
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,080
[All you have to do is
know that I'm into you]

215
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,280
[Mm]

216
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,800
[So cold-hearted]

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,240
[But I like it]

218
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,240
You don't seem so well.

219
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,240
What? I'm fine.

220
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
Fine?

221
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,400
Are you sure?

222
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,960
Just thinking about something.

223
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,120
I think you should get some rest.

224
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,680
Kao, I'm really fine.

225
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,320
- Hi, Kao.
- Hi.

226
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,880
I bought you some dessert from the shops.

227
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Thank you so much.

228
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,040
- Here's yours.
- Thanks.

229
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,880
It looks good.

230
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,520
I also bought one for you, Phai.

231
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Phai,

232
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,880
please have dinner with me today.

233
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,480
Phai,

234
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,760
please.

235
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,360
What are you doing?

236
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,400
Just posting a Story.

237
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,720
It's nothing.

238
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,520
Well,

239
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,480
you're not gonna be in a serious
relationship with him, right?

240
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,120
No answer. Does that mean it's true?

241
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,920
Type, not only Chao,

242
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,960
but I won't date anyone.

243
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,800
You're still the same.

244
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,880
You're still you.

245
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I like the way you are.

246
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,320
Right, I'm afraid
of how people will think of me

247
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,280
if they know I date men.

248
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,280
I understand
if you care more about that.

249
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,960
But we broke up
because you didn't understand me.

250
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,120
But I do now.

251
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,560
Let's be together again.

252
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,520
Please, Phai. Please.

253
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
I'll go pick up this call.

254
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,680
It won't be long.

255
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,440
Right, it's tonight.

256
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,080
I'm with Phai.

257
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I don't buy it. Show me some proof.

258
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,600
Proof? Sure.

259
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,840
I'll send you a full video.

260
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,680
Get the money ready.

261
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,440
Phai is easy.

262
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,480
Some flirty pick-up lines...

263
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,640
will make him spread his legs for me.

264
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,160
What the fuck is wrong with you?

265
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,320
Why the fuck did you do that?

266
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
Are you serious?

267
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,120
Let's make a bet

268
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,840
if I'll get to score him tonight.

269
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,360
Keep this in mind.

270
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,920
Don't mess with Phai again.

271
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,360
Why are you here?

272
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,440
I saw that bastard's Story.

273
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,400
I recognized your arm,

274
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,680
so I came here.

275
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,720
Let's go, Phai.

276
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,880
Wait, Chao!

277
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,920
What did you do?

278
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,960
Why are there bruises
all over your face?

279
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,200
Let's leave, please.

280
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,240
Apply this compression.

281
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,680
Why are you not mad at him
after knowing the truth?

282
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,200
I've been suspicious of him
since the beginning,

283
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
so I wasn't surprised.

284
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
- Suspicious?
- Yeah.

285
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,160
You became blind
because of too much jealousy!

286
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Listen.

287
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,360
I've never thought of going back to him.

288
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,880
Got it?

289
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,320
I was suspicious of him
because he'd been gone for years,

290
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,960
but he came back.

291
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,080
But it's so shitty of him
to do that to me.

292
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,240
If he messes with you again,

293
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,520
I'll go all out after him!

294
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,480
I'm worried about you.

295
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Mm. Thanks.

296
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,800
I missed you badly as we didn't meet.

297
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
Why were you gone, then?

298
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,800
I went to your shop,

299
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,200
but I saw you with that bastard.

300
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,120
So, I left.

301
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,600
With who? When?

302
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,040
His face was close to yours,
and it looked like you were...

303
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,040
I didn't kiss him.

304
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,640
Did I misunderstand?

305
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,280
Do you need me to curse at you?

306
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,960
What a shame!

307
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,880
I misunderstood you for so long!

308
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,160
Otherwise,
I would've been with you a lot earlier.

309
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,440
Well, we did meet.

310
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,200
When? In my dreams?

311
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,960
Were there a lot of dogs in there?

312
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,200
May I request injury time?

313
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,840
Are you a soccer player?

314
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,120
May I?

315
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,520
If your face doesn't hurt,
do what you want.

316
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,080
Nail, is Pae busy lately?

317
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,440
We rarely meet him.

318
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,040
He said he'd help the girls with the work.

319
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,120
What? Why didn't he tell us?

320
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,360
I don't know.

321
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,080
He said he'd tell us
if there was anything.

322
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,200
He's completely gone.

323
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,480
- Peek-a-boo!
- Jeez.

324
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,320
What are you talking about?

325
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,440
- You look stressed.
- You scared me!

326
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,280
Sorry for such a sudden appointment.

327
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,160
You know Him's class schedule.

328
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,680
Why did you make an appointment today?

329
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
It's totally fine. We're free.

330
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,200
I'm sorry again.

331
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,160
Take your hand off of him.

332
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,200
He can't breathe.

333
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,240
Thanks a lot, Chaochom.

334
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,760
He's so docile with you.

335
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,200
Stop it, Chao. You're talking too much.

336
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Alright,

337
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
let's get to the point.

338
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,400
I called you guys here to ask
for your help in making a video

339
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,760
to promote the outdoor cinema event.

340
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,000
Whoa, are you sure that's all?

341
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,360
Well...

342
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
Our friends at the faculty

343
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,760
say that everyone knows Stay Four.

344
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,680
So, if you guys are okay,

345
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,880
that'll help a lot.

346
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm okay with that. I can help you.

347
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,080
If it's for Nail, I'm willing to do it.

348
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,160
I can do it.

349
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,520
Okay! Alright!

350
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,960
Then, deal! Tell me.

351
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,400
What do you want me to do?

352
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,280
I'm always ready.

353
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,880
Well, do you need help from Te, too?

354
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,480
We haven't told him yet.

355
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,040
That's great.

356
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,960
If he's free, that'd be nice.

357
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,120
Sure. I'll tell him.

358
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,720
Hello?

359
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,120
Hello, Te.

360
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,200
Chaochom and her friends want us

361
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,400
to film a promo video for
the outdoor cinema event.

362
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,800
Do you wanna join us?

363
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,960
When?

364
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,640
Next week? Are you free?

365
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,160
There's me, Chao, and Him.

366
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,440
Can you guys still talk

367
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,400
if it's not about studying?

368
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,320
It's fine if you can't.

369
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,960
I'll go now.

370
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,840
How did it go?

371
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,360
He said he'd come.

372
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,240
It's settled, then.

373
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,640
Piece?

374
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
My mom told me to give this to Auntie Tai.

375
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,880
My mom's not here.

376
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
Place it in the kitchen for her.

377
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,320
It's not for me. Why would I do that?

378
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,320
It's nothing big.

379
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,280
Jeez!

380
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,240
Aren't you going to wait
to see my mom first?

381
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,240
She's about to be back.

382
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,720
No! I won't be with someone here.

383
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,080
Tell your mom that I came.

384
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,160
I won't.

385
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,840
Tell her yourself.

386
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,120
You're getting on my nerves, Te.

387
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,640
Yes, I am.

388
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,240
Now,
when will I be getting into your heart?

389
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,360
I see...

390
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,040
You don't want to wait here
because you're still into me, right?

391
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,480
Hi, Auntie Tai.

392
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,720
Go to blazes, Techin!

393
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,120
Cheers to the cinema event team!

394
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,240
- Cheers!
- Yay!

395
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080
It's a shame that Te and Som are not here.

396
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,080
Right, we haven't hung out
as a whole group for a long time.

397
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,960
We should come again later.

398
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,880
He said he'd come, though.

399
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,600
I see. Fab!

400
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,200
Cheers!

401
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,120
Should we get up?

402
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,680
Let's do it, girls!

403
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,960
- Stand up. Come on, all of you!
- Get up!

404
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,320
Stand up, everybody.

405
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,080
You want this?

406
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,480
I'll be right back.

407
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,240
Stay here with your friends.

408
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,000
Where are you going?

409
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,400
It won't take long. I'll be back.

410
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,400
Nail, dance with us.

411
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,240
Come on!

412
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,400
Te!

413
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,000
Why do you keep stalking Nail?

414
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,080
What are you trying to do?!

415
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,920
- Answer me!
- I didn't do anything.

416
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,560
What's the stalking for, then?!

417
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,040
- Listen to me.
- Listen to you?

418
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,320
I was just trying to help Nail.

419
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,640
Him, stop it!

420
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,120
- You asshole!
- Him, don't do it!

421
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,000
Stop it!

422
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,920
Don't do this.

423
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
Te's done nothing to me.

424
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,400
He's the one who hurt you!

425
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,920
Nail, I...

426
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,960
Shut up!

427
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,440
Were you the rider who hit Nail?

428
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,120
Was it you?!

429
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,000
Hey!

430
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,160
Why the fuck are you screaming?!

431
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,080
It's annoying.

432
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,480
I'm here just to end this motherfucker.

433
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,800
Is that the one who hurt you?

434
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, go get him.

435
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,480
Go!

436
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,720
Type,

437
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,960
what are you doing with my friend?

438
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,400
Stop it, Type.

439
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,880
It's you who has to stop.

440
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,720
It's none of your business.

441
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,040
I'm here to end this motherfucker.

442
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,560
Go get him!

443
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Just fight with me if you're bold enough!

444
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,240
Chao, calm down. Take it easy.

445
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,800
Come here if you're not scared, buttface.

446
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,520
- Hey...
- It's okay.

447
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,080
I'll handle this.

448
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,240
Hey!

449
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,840
Him!

450
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Him!!

451
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:57,920
Him!

452
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,560
- Don't...
- Call an ambulance.

453
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,680
Call an ambulance!

454
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,720
Shit!

455
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,080
Te, why didn't you close the doors?

456
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,520
Te!

457
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,840
I don't know what happened,

458
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,960
but don't hurt yourself.

459
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,440
I'm sleepy.

460
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,240
- When did you arrive?
- Let me ask you something.

461
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,640
With me, you just gave me the mic

462
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,800
and let me do it myself.

463
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,800
You're a man!

464
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,360
Right. You're so good at talking.

465
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,600
You don't need questions.

466
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,320
You can just keep talking.

467
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
And you kept going.

468
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,600
Just put me in black and white and film just her.

469
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,160
Rest in peace.

470
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,760
When did you arrive?

471
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,760
When? 6 A.M.?

472
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,520
We came together, didn't we?

473
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,320
Right, give him some airtime!

474
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,480
I'd better leave.

475
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,680
I'll go now.

476
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,240
What's gonna happen today?

477
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
- Right?
- It's at the college.

478
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,520
It's around...

479
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,400
- 8.30 A.M.
- Right.

480
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,160
I still don't remember the dialogue.

481
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,960
A friend's gonna tease her.

482
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,680
Like, "Were you with a guy last night?"

483
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,280
- What is it?
- What?

484
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,080
What was the first scene?

485
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,880
- What was it?
- Chaochom was talking to her friend.

486
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,160
She teased her best friend first.

487
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,960
Then, her friend teased her back.

488
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,960
How many scenes
do you have to shoot today?

489
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,280
I think...around 5.

490
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,200
It's less than the other day.

491
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,120
It's a lot.

492
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,960
- I'll have time to sleep, for sure.
- For sure.

493
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,560
Now, let's meet another person.

494
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,200
- Leave it.
- You should get some rest.

495
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,040
Okay?

496
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,960
There's nowhere to sleep.

497
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Camera speed! Cut!

498
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,360
Cut 2. Take 1.

499
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,000
- Have you shot any scenes yet?
- Not yet.

500
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,760
- When did you arrive?
- Noon.

501
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,320
How was it?

502
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,960
They've shot so many scenes already,
but why did you just come?

503
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,960
I went to film
my own video about my haircut.

504
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,240
They're here.

505
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,440
What did they teach you?

506
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,360
To speak Anntonia's speech.

507
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,640
I'm practicing saying it.

508
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,880
I could remember it,
but I forgot it after a while.

509
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,040
- Give it to this woman.
- How do you say it?

510
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,760
"Hola Universo."

511
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,640
Say the next line!

512
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,840
I don't remember it!

513
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,400
Say what you can remember.

514
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,680
- "Anntonia Porsild..."
- Jeez!

515
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,680
- "Anntonia Porsild."
- What you told me the other day...

516
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,360
Orgulmunyo?

517
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,640
Orgulmunyo?

518
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,920
Is that a Korean word?

519
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,240
Yeah, it is.

520
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,240
It's becoming Korean.

521
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,040
I lost energy waiting here.

522
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,480
"Soy Anntonia Porsild.

523
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,240
Representando a...

524
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,440
Tailandia!"

525
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,920
That's it. What's next?

526
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,240
I'm exhausted from waiting.

527
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,880
♫No one's ever passing by here♫

528
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,040
♫What am I waiting for?♫

529
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,240
Why are you here?

530
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,240
I saw that bastard's Story.

531
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,240
I recognized your arm,

532
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,400
so I came here.

533
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,560
- Let's leave.
- Wait, Chao!

534
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,640
What did you do?

535
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,720
Why are there bruises
all over your face?

536
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,880
Let's leave, please.

537
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,720
Was it clear?

538
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,720
- Was it not blurry?
- Yes.

539
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,960
And then, they'll scream.
You say, "Stop screaming!"

540
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,240
Start screaming.

541
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,720
Hey! Stop screaming!

542
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,160
Who is he? Which asshole?

543
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,880
- This one.
- Which one?

544
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,040
Which asshole is he talking about?

545
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,360
This one?

546
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,840
Face-to-face. Fight him.

547
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,080
If you're bold enough...

548
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,400
Let him get through first.

549
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Don't block him just yet.

550
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,000
Come here.

551
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,840
Point the gun at him.

552
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,360
Right, right there.

553
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,000
Now, back up.

554
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,720
Look at the gun first.

555
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,120
Now, get him and tell him to step back.

556
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,440
You, try to stop him.

557
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,160
Hey! Stop it!

558
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,400
He pulled out his gun.

559
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,760
I'll call an ambulance.

560
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,120
Call the police!

561
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,680
Hurry!

562
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,280
Someone got shot!

563
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,040
4, 3, 2, 1...

564
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,360
Right?!

565
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,520
Him, stop!

566
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,600
Bang!

567
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,720
Hey! You're so annoying!

568
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,960
Why the fuck are you screaming?!

569
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,560
I'm here to end this asshole.

570
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,520
Him!

571
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,880
Him!! Him!

572
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,640
Call an ambulance.

573
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,320
I'll call an ambulance.

574
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,600
Call the police!

575
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,360
Him!

576
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,040
How was EP10?

577
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,240
It was so intense. I even got hurt.

578
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,720
Right, he went all out.

579
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,520
- I saw him running.
- Your knees are swollen?

580
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,560
Right, because I bumped into something.

581
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,480
Let's find out.

582
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,200
This EP is so sick.

583
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,160
- It is.
- Why?

584
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,600
There's a plot twist.

585
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,800
Let them find out.

586
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,520
- Don't tell them.
- Is it gonna happen in a club?

587
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,120
- A club?
- Look at our outfits!

588
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,760
Right, look at our outfits.

589
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,040
Where did you go?

590
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,720
- You disappeared.
- I was talking to the floor.

591
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
- She tripped over.
- Really?

592
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,680
- Yes.
- When?

593
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,000
Just a while ago. I tripped over.

594
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,160
You were dancing.

595
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,080
She felt weak at the knees.

596
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,040
- But I liked this EP!
- Right?

597
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,640
- I got to be me.
- Exactly!

598
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,440
- It's a party!
- It's enjoyable.

599
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,720
- Right.
- Right.

600
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,640
- You won't ask us anything?
- We are a gang.

601
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,080
- She was drunk.
- It was fun.

602
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,640
There's gonna be every taste in it.

603
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,800
- Was there blood?
- Sour, sweet, salty...

604
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,440
We'll have to wait and see
if it'll bleed tomorrow.

605
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,360
Okay, tell them to watch the next EP.

606
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Please stick around to see EP11.

607
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,920
- And we'll keep you guys...
- Updated.

608
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,440
- Right.
- Right, all the time.

609
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,520
You can watch the behind-the-scenes.

610
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,760
- It's coming to an end.
- Right.

611
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,920
- What end?
- It's ending.

612
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,680
- What end?
- The series is ending.

613
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,440
We're coming to
the last phase of the series.

614
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,840
Please stay tuned.

615
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,600
- My throat is sore.
- Let's find out together.

616
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,520
- Right.
- Yes.

617
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,080
We screamed a lot. Bye-bye.

618
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,920
- Please support For Him.
- Right. Please support us.

619
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,120
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

620
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,160
Yay!

621
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,400
You're still energetic?!

622
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,440
Well, let's tell them something.

623
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,640
- Like, what we had...
- We had liquor,

624
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,880
- Beer...
- cocktail drinks...

625
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,240
Right.

626
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,640
- No!
- Tell them what happened?

627
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,520
That scene's gonna be in EP10.

628
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,920
It's coming to an end.

629
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,040
Well... Yeah.

630
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,280
Keep going. Ignore that.

631
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,840
It was such an intense scene.

632
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
- Intense?
- Yeah.

633
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,560
- Violent?
- Intense and violent!

634
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,560
- Violent?
- There was no blood.

635
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,640
There was a bit of it.

636
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,960
- Give me the blood again.
- Look.

637
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,760
You're making me look bad.

638
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,240
But Dew and Fu were
fighting in that scene.

639
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,840
- Right?
- No!

640
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,360
- That's not right.
- That's not true!

641
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,360
I'll show you the wound.

642
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,280
There's a wound?

643
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,320
It's noticeable.

644
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,480
- What is that?!
- You gave it your all!

645
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,840
I need to call an ambulance.

646
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,480
- Get me an ambulance.
- Did a mosquito bite you?

647
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,400
- Mosquito!
- I'm going to claim my insurance!

648
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,200
Because of a mosquito bite?

649
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,560
Spill the tea.

650
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,080
How did you fight?

651
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,960
- I'll let you do it.
- You two won't stop arguing!

652
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,680
He started it. I wasn't at fault.

653
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,080
He's the bad guy.

654
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,960
And why did you have to do it in EP10?

655
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,280
Why didn't you do it in the very first EP?

656
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,960
We always wanted to fight.

657
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,920
That's also true.

658
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,560
- That's true.
- They had to show that

659
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,920
Te and Him are best friends.

660
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,400
They are, but Te was mad.

661
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,480
Well, he chose me.

662
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,600
I guess you need another punch.

663
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,440
Calm down. It's me, Dew.

664
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,000
I see. You're not Him.

665
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,160
He's not.

666
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,600
They're going to throw some hands
at each other again.

667
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,600
I did nothing but sit here.

668
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,680
It's about Nail, not...

669
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,800
- But it's...
- That wasn't a spoiler.

670
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,680
- He ruined it.
- What did he say?

671
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,360
Nothing.

672
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,560
- What did he say?
- Keep going.

673
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,080
No, it's nothing.

674
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,680
- Okay.
- Keep going.

675
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,680
This scene is very important.

676
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
- Very important.
- So important that...

677
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,640
- Right.
- We shot 4 scenes in a row.

678
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,840
We shot them in a row.

679
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,800
- There were so many actors...
- A lot!

680
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,040
- A lot!
- The largest number...

681
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,720
It set a new record
for the Guinness World Records.

682
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,240
- That's not true.
- You're exaggerating.

683
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,400
- It's not true?
- Yeah.

684
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,200
- But...
- There were a lot of them.

685
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,760
It was fun.
It's like I got to improve my skills.

686
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,120
With limited time,

687
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,240
- we had to finish it.
- Right.

688
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,640
No matter how hard it was...

689
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,520
The dialogue wasn't a problem.

690
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,560
Because you could remember it?

691
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,160
Because it was all removed.

692
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,400
You forgot all of it.

693
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,360
We had to feel like
we were in that situation,

694
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,160
so I could recall it.
I didn't just memorize it.

695
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,160
- It's the situation that helped.
- Right.

696
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,080
- That doesn't sound right.
- Do I sound professional?

697
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,920
- Right.
- You do.

698
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,600
Well, this is EP10.

699
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,160
- There are 2 EPs left.
- Right.

700
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,240
So, you'll get to see
some character development in this EP.

701
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,520
That includes Techin's, Him's, and Nail's.

702
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,000
- They'll...
- Did you forget about Him?

703
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,240
Almost.

704
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,200
I thought you were dead for real.

705
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,600
You'll get to see so much
character development from now on,

706
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,560
as it's coming to an end.

707
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,800
It's gonna be a fun EP.

708
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,480
We got to meet everyone. It was fun.

709
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,120
It was fun.

710
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
Right, because I got to see a fight.

711
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,080
You liked it?

712
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,280
- Our pain...
- Actually,

713
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,720
Him didn't get shot.

714
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,320
You could see that
he bumped into a chair and tripped over.

715
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,760
His head hit a glass.

716
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,240
You're making me look bad.

717
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,280
Can I tell them this?

718
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,480
- What is it?
- It was so bad.

719
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,080
- What happened?
- I tripped over.

720
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,720
They were trying to grab me
saying, "Are you okay?"

721
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,040
Then, they grabbed at...

722
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,880
- Yeah.
- The set was big.

723
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,320
My dear.

724
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,800
Right.

725
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,200
Who did that?

726
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,360
I won't say the name,
but I'll condemn that person.

727
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,080
I won't talk to that person for...

728
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,440
- A day?
- a minute.

729
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,600
- You're so soft-hearted.
- No, they didn't mean to do it.

730
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,520
It was just... There were so many parts...

731
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,720
You could feel relaxed,
and wouldn't feel stressed.

732
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,360
- Is that so?
- Turns out it's even worse.

733
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,480
That's right.

734
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,240
I said, "Take it easy."

735
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,440
And when I tripped over...

736
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,840
I was into my character.

737
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,720
Right.

738
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,440
- You really tripped over?
- His hands were attached to my hair.

739
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,760
Did your hair fall off?

740
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,080
My first question was,

741
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,240
"Did it fall off?"

742
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,360
He cried because his hair fell off.

743
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,200
- The next EP is 11.
- That's right.

744
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,320
The next one's EP11.
We're about to reach the last EP.

745
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,240
Let's stick around to see
if Him's gonna survive.

746
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,280
Yes!

747
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,960
I can't say anything more than that.
That's all I know.

748
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,040
Let's see if he's gonna die.

749
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,400
Him might...

750
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,880
become another person.

751
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,680
This series might end
in a different way you think it will.

752
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,240
What will you be reborn as?

753
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,520
What an evolution!

754
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,160
Maybe fertilizer.

755
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,920
Let's just go.

756
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,480
- See ya.
- Yeah.

757
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,040
He never gave in to me.

758
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,000
Try disappearing from his life.

759
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,760
Can I take a break from you for a while?

760
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,800
When I'm ready, I'll come back to you.

761
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,320
You should talk things out.

762
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,840
But he doesn't want to meet me.

763
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,160
Are you blind?
He's head over heels in love with you.
