00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,930
There's meat today.

5
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,170
What kind of meat is this?

6
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,770
Is it good?

7
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,650
Yes.

8
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,490
Rat meat.

9
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,130
Just kidding.

10
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,970
Rabbit meat.

11
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:44,880
What?

12
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,810
Rabbit meat.

13
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,060
How can I not eat it

14
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,970
even if it's really rat meat?

15
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,890
Let me tell you,

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,130
you're lucky.

17
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,440
The clips we put on the hill

18
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,009
only caught two this month.

19
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,330
Twice?

20
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,570
What was the last time?

21
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,490
It was you.

22
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,540
Hey,

23
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,920
why did you call me a brute?

24
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,520
Where is your father?

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,850
Why didn't you ask your father to come for dinner?

26
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,930
He's working.

27
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,169
I kept the meat in the pot for him.

28
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,360
I'll take his shift after I finish.

29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,560
Our peasant family is like a sparrow.

30
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,210
We count the grains to live.

31
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,040
You may starve to death even if you just slack off one day.

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,360
Is it that serious?

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,410
You really

34
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,120
know nothing.

35
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,960
Are all educated people like this?

36
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,490
My sister once said

37
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,600
I don't know much about the world.

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,570
Listen, educated man.

39
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,579
When my family

40
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,840
had five acres of land,

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,680
my father, my uncle,

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,130
and my cousin.

43
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,040
There were three strong men.

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,730
Although life is hard,

45
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,800
we can still live.

46
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,200
Isn't that good?

47
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,680
But the government's taxes is heavy.

48
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,770
Except for the regular tax twice a year,

49
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,370
there are also

50
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,520
other taxes

51
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,130
and corvee labor.

52
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,329
In the past year,

53
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,520
there was nothing left.

54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,400
Two years ago,

55
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,240
my uncle and cousin went to the army.

56
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,800
One died at the construction site.

57
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,400
One fell sick.

58
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,530
We lost half of our men.

59
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,610
We don't even have enough farmers.

60
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,210
After paying the government tax,

61
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,420
I don't even have money

62
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,360
to buy seed next year.

63
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,280
What should we do?

64
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,560
Borrow?

65
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,680
But the only thing we can borrow

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,810
is the usury.

67
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,450
Then, Lu Feilong showed up.

68
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,530
He tricked us

69
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,320
to sell our land at a low price.

70
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,930
At first,

71
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,730
we sold second-class slope.

72
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,760
But the interest

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,800
is too much.

74
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,250
It's getting more and more.

75
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,570
Eventually, we can't pay back.

76
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,540
We sold out the slope,

77
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,480
selling the irrigated field,

78
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,010
and sold out the farmlands.

79
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,000
We barely paid back

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,570
the usury.

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,980
I had no choice

82
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,400
to come to the wilderness.

83
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,740
Is there no other way?

84
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,690
Once you lost your land,

85
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,320
you either become rich people's tenant peasant,

86
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,820
or run away

87
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,690
and become a refugee.

88
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,370
In that case,

89
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,440
rich people have

90
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,330
more and more land.

91
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,610
Then the ordinary citizen have

92
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,610
less and less land.

93
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,810
That's right.

94
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,080
Look at Tongyang,

95
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,970
the land of the gentry and the rich merchant

96
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,210
is contiguous

97
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,360
What about our ordinary people?

98
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,260
We can only make use of

99
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,440
every single place.

100
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,399
When we really need to pay taxes,

101
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,610
it will be bitter.

102
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,130
That's not right.

103
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,010
The more land there is,

104
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,690
the more taxes we pay.

105
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,200
Rich people have their own way.

106
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,200
There are many ways to pay less taxes.

107
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,490
Otherwise, how could they try so hard

108
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,920
to get the land?

109
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,040
But the government's taxes

110
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,210
is fixed.

111
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,610
If they pay less taxes,

112
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,200
we have to pay more.

113

why the richer people

the less taxes they pay?

117

What is the emperor thinking?

118
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,409
That's because the government cares about the noblemen.

119
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,290
That's why the provisions are exempted

00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,440
I can't remember

690
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,090
other details.

691
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,929
That means

692
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,360
your father left you this book.

693
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,449
But you haven't

694
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,969
seen it, right?

695
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,409
No.

696
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,250
Director Ren seems to know what's going on,

697
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,130
but he refused to tell me.

698
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,050
Jiamo, stop talking about

699
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,560
this book.

700
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,050
Tomorrow,

701
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,889
the trial will be held.

702
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,120
I heard

703
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,000
they are determined

704
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,130
to close your case.

705
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,530
I've found

706
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,449
good evidence.

707
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,520
As long as we can read the Book of Employment.

708
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,020
Jiamo, this is not the place for you

709
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,570
to find the truth.

710
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,890
This is where the Yin and Yang are reconciled.

711
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,040
Yin and Yang?

712
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,930
Yin and Yang

713
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,840
means that everyone is satisfied

714
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,400
and everyone is not satisfied.

715
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,060
In the end,

716
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,600
this is the only way.

717
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,520
There's Yang in the Yin and Yin in the Yang.

718
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,280
This is the way of compromise.

719
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,410
This concerns interests.

720
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,530
So your efforts

721
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,090
is meaningless.

722
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't understand what you're talking about.

723
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,960
Why can't you understand

724
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,530
what I am trying to tell you?

725
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,760
Listen to me.

726
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,820
I hope I can

727
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,520
save your life

728
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,610
in the trial tomorrow.

729
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,220
So,

730
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,050
you have to cooperate with me.

731
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,850
How?

732
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,210
You don't say or do anything.

733
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,040
You mean

734
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,200
you want me to stop calculating this?

735
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,050
Don't do anything.

736
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,840
Many things have come to my mind lately.

737
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,490
But I can't remember

738
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,610
more things.

739
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,570
So I have more

740
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,280
and more doubts.

741
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,080
The Silk Book.

742
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,290
Why is it called the Silk Book?

743
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,440
Silk.

744
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,020
What does it have to do

745
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,330
with the the Silk Poll Tax?

746
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,730
What is the relationship between

747
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,000
the case and the arithmetic skill.

748
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,450
My father's crime

749
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,610
is also about the Silk Poll Tax.

750
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,490
If I could see that book…

751
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,720
What can you do

752
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,010
even if you can see that book?

753
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,480
You need to figure out

754
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,800
your own situation now.

755
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,720
Don't be like your father

756
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,890
who can't figure out his own position.

757
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,240
Think about it

758
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,650
yourself.
