00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,160
Did you trap them both

13
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,850
in the warehouse

14
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,140
to burn to death?

15
00:01:58,729 --> 00:01:59,280
Originally you wanted to

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,060
create the scene of an accidental fire?

17
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,300
Yes.

18
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,330
If we do away with the both of them,

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,340
we'll be able to get rid of all the trouble.

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,530
But it's not too bad now either.

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,570
I can just kill them again.

22
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,140
Stop!

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,500
What?

24
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,660
If you attempt to kill them again now,

25
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,840
it will take on

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,180
a completely different meaning.

27
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,660
What's the difference?

28
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,310
Now that the Archives caught fire,

29
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,820
if they're found dead outside,

30
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,060
it'll just make it obvious to others that

31
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,579
there's something fishy about this.

32
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,370
I have a way

33
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,470
to make the bodies disappear without a trace.

34
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,650
As long as Shuai Jiamo's body

35
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,950
is not in the library,

36
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,900
Inspector Liu

37
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,670
will definitely be suspicious.

38
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,820
Then I can just kill them,

39
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,110
and put their bodies back in.

40
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,140
That's a good idea.

41
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,630
There are so many people outside fighting the fire.

42
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,370
We can

43
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,670
sneakily smuggle

44
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,750
their bodies back in

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,860
without anyone knowing.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,980
That's right.

47
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,460
Tell me then.

48
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,660
Do you have any ideas?

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,940
I do have one.

50
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:03,940
Pray tell.

51
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,900
I need his

52

cooperation.

Inspector Liu.

54
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,579
We just checked everywhere earlier.

55
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,390
The ruins only have a lot of ash left from the paper

56
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,140
and some remaining wooden structures.

57
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,380
There were no bodies to be found.

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,020
Lu Feilong is such a fool.

59
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,500
Don't worry, Magistrate Mao.

60
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,579
I've settled everything.

62

left yesterday,

it was Shuai Jiamo

64
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,790
who voluntarily asked to stay behind?

65
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,620
Yes.

66
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,000
We asked him to eat.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,720
He didn't leave,

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,740
and was still in a daze.

69
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,860
The paper on the desk was completely blank.

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,790
We even asked him

71
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,940
about the progress,

72
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,220
but he didn't answer.

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,180
who else saw Shuai Jiamo after that?

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,860
Probably just the old official

76
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,980
who looks after the library.

77
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,460

Go.

00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,170
Bring Zhang over.

the Archives need to be locked up.

[Archives]

83
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,780
When I went to lock the door today,

84
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,290
I saw the two scribes saying that

85
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,980
Mr. Shuai was still in the library.

86
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,940
Zhang,

87
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,670
was there anyone else besides Shuai Jiamo

88
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,110
in the archive library?

89
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,519
There was another

90
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,420
young master called Feng Baoyu.

91
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,980
Later,

92
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,029
they started to quarrel.

93
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,210
They quarreled?

94
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,820
What did they quarrel about?

95
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,350
My hearing isn't too good,

96
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,780
so I couldn't really hear clearly.

97
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,620
Something about the fish-scale map not making it in time,

98
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,540
and how to explain to people about it,

99
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,450
not to implicate them, things like that.

100
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,220
I reminded them it was time to lock up.

101
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,800
But that young master got angry

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,430
and chased me out.

103
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,380
They said

104
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,940
they were working for Inspector Liu,

105
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,740
and that if I kept nagging,

106
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,780
and ended up delaying important matters,

107
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,340
they would hold me accountable.

108
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,860
After being chased out by them,

109
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,420
I was still worried,

110
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,300
so I came to check.

111
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,220
This fire

112
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,300
was all my fault.

113
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,200
Zhang, after the fire,

114
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,050
did you see

115
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,500
Shuai Jiamo and Feng Baoyu?

116
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,340
I really have no clue.

117
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,460
Inspector Liu.

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,000
Shuai Jiamo

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,130
promised to find out

120
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,780
the truth behind the silk poll tax.

121
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,750
But he got into trouble,

122
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,220
and we only have a blank piece of paper.

123
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,500
As for Feng Baoyu,

124
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,290
he bet all of

125
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,780
his money on

126
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,540
Shuai Jaime's victory.

127
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,130
But he realized that

128
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,510
Shuai Jiamo didn't make much progress,

129
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,420
and got extremely anxious.

130
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,740
He then came to the Archives

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,930
to urge Shuai Jiamo to stay up and go through the documents.

132
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,140
And so,

133
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,380
he ended up getting into an argument with him.

134
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,000
This was the both of them

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,900
pushing the blame onto each other.

136
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,800
You're talking as if

137
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,220
you actually saw what was going on.

138
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,610
Were you there too?

139
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,110
I'm from Zhuge Village.

140
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,120
The banquet that you

141
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,950
and the others attended earlier

142
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,380
was organized by me.

143
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,910
I've also been on standby near the banquet,

144
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,820
and never once left.

145
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,300
Cut the crap.

146
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,900
Get to the point.

147
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,250
Well, I don't know

148
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,210
what exactly happened

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,750
afterwards either.

150
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,030
Maybe as the both of them

151
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,300
were arguing,

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,510
they accidentally knocked over a candle,

153
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,780
and caused this terrible disaster.

154
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,160
Then where would they have gone afterwards?

155
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,420
They probably fled.

156
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,850
You should know that

157
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,900
it was the Archives of Lanxi County

158
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,850
that got burnt down.

159
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,150
At worst, they could be sentenced to death for it.

160
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,100
Of course the both of them

161
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,240
would have fled for their lives,

162
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,900
why would they stay here

163
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,500
to await death?

164
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,540
These deductions of yours

165
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,590
are mere speculations.

166
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,980
Let's take my deductions as incorrect

167
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,280
for now.

168
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,070
If both of them

169
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,400
had nothing to do with the fire,

170
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,140
then they would be innocent.

171
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,260
Why did they run away then?

172
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,310
They could have stayed where they were.

173
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,220
Or they could have

174
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,260
gone directly to find you, Inspector Liu.

175
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm afraid...

176
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,030
Inspector Liu, do you have

177
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,620
any other opinions?

178
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,740
Smart idea.

179
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:21,980
Master Fan.

180
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,460
I’m glad I didn't fail you.

181
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,300
Even in such a rush,

182
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,210
you put up such a good show that

183
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,620
even I almost believed it.

184
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,310
If you want to cover something up,

185
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,860
just bring something else up.

186
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,930
This is a common strategy used by lawyers.

187
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,870
How are the two of them now?

188
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,600
They have both been smuggled out of

189
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
Lanxi County by Lu Feilong,

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,580
and will be secretly detained on the way to Tongyang.

191
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,870
Once the arrest warrant

192
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,370
is sent out to all the counties in Jin'an,

193
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,300
Lu Feilong will then turn them in

194
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,680
to the county office of Tongyang County.

195
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,260
Why do you have to send them to

196
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,860
Magistrate Deng's,

197
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,340
instead of just doing it here in Lanxi?

198
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,690
They're fleeing after all.

199
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,610
Obviously they should flee for a distance before we catch them.

200
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,980
That makes it more believable.

201
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,700
Magistrate Mao.

202
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,910
Speaking of which, you'll need to do me a favor.

203
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,420
Write an extra note

204
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,770
giving Lu Feilong the status

205
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,860
of a constable.

206
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,980
It'll be easier for him then

207
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,940
to arrest people across the borders.

208
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,710
And then?

209
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,910
And then naturally Tongyang will transfer

210
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,140
the criminals back to Lanxi,

211
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,910
where they will stand trial.

212
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,640
Instead of going in such a huge circle,

213
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,840
it's so much more straightforward to just

214
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,460
kill them off at one go.

215
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,500
Speed,

216
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,510
doesn't necessarily mean it's ideal.

217
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,100
How dare you!

218
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,660
What I mean by this is,

219
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,270
such a big fire happening at the Archives

220
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,940
is a serious matter.

221
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,100
We can't hide it.

222
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,270
We will have to give the imperial court

223
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,100
an explanation for it.

224
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,020
Instead of burning Shuai and Feng to death,

225
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,929
why don't we just

226
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,740
let them take the blame for this?

227
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,340
Although it's a bit more troublesome,

228
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,830
but there are no loopholes in the process

229
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,340
and we can prevent any further troubles from happening.

230
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,660
I'll handle the paperwork.

231
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,810
Third Brother.

232
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,150
Sending these two guys so far away

233
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,820
through the night

234
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,180
without killing them or letting them go,

235
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,300
what do you think they're trying to do?

236
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,870
Just do what we're told.

237
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,100
Why are you asking so much?

238
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,790
When Big Brother comes later,

239
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,830
just follow his instructions,

240
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,740
and we'll be done with this.

241
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,460
Where am I?

242
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,490
Let's think of a way

243
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,740
to get these ropes off us.

244
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,820
Okay.

245
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,080
Big Brother.

246
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,920
Calm down, calm down.

247
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,690
Calm down, my foot!

248
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,240
This bastard

249
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,260
always comes up with bad ideas.

250
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,820
Let's not wait for the arrest warrant,

251
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,310
and just kill the both of them.

252
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,310
Just say that they resisted arrest,

253
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,140
and we had to kill them.

254
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,880
Big Brother.

255
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,510
Where are they?

256
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,740
They're tied up in the room.

257
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,740
Big Brother, they're here.

258
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,180
Where are they?

259
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,780
Where are they?

260
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,220
After them!

261
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,540
Let's give up on the ropes.

262
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,700
We won't untie them, let's just go.

263
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,540
Let's go.

264
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,340
Shuai!

265
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,700
Shuai!

266
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,340
Are you okay?

267
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,450
After them!

268
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,360
Let's go!

269
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,820
Let's go.

270
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,380
Baoyu!

271
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,720
Baoyu!

272
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,820
Stop rolling, Baoyu.

273
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,660
Sister!

274
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,540
Sister!

275
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,340
Shuai! Shuai!

276
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,260
It hurts.

277
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,390
What's wrong?

278
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,430
It hurts.

279
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,420
Baoyu.

280
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:12,890
Be gentle.

281
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,940
Wait, it hurts!

282
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,100
It hurts.

283
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,420
Have you seen-

284
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,260
Xiao Zhi?

285
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,930
Weren't you two

286
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,250
living in Renhua?

287
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,970
Why are you here in the mountains of Tongyang?

288
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,380
What are you doing here?

289
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,220
Don't be afraid.

290
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,180
Our old grudges are cleared now.

291
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,820
I'm not here for you today.

292
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,550
Let me ask you.

293
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,640
Just now, there were two

294
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,970
scholar-looking people

295
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,650
who passed by here.

296
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,820
Have you seen them?

297
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,780
Yes, we did.

298
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,300
They went down the mountain.

299
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:00,860
Let's go.

300
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,730
Actually, even without your land,

301
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,420
you can still come to work on my land as a sharecropper.

302
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,350
Why come to the mountains here to

303
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,670
try and cultivate barren land?

304
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,060
It's such hard work.

305
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,500
We don't need to you to worry about that.

306
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,340
I'd rather work for myself.

307
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,300
I find it pretty strange.

308
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,260
You say the two of them passed by,

309
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,590
and if they saw

310
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,260
such a big hut here,

311
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,370
wouldn't they come over and have a look?

312
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,690
Please leave now.

313
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,190
You're not welcome here,

314
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,310
and not a single person is welcome here.

315
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,860
Leave, leave!

316
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,670
Search!

317
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,540
Yes.

318
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,020
Big Brother.

319
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,540
There's an underground cellar here.

320
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,170
You can't go in.

321
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,830
The cellar hasn't been ventilated for a long time.

322
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,130
It's dangerous to just enter rashly.

323
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,060
Out of the way.

324
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,700
Let me do it.

325
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,030
Big Brother.

326
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,340
Big Brother, what's wrong?

327
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:47,970
Big Brother!

328
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,510
Are you okay?

329
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,350
Help him out.

330
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,020
Okay, hurry up!

331
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,110
Big Brother.

332
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,010
Slowly, slowly.

333
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,500
-Slowly.
-Big Brother. Hurry!

334
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,680
Big Brother!

335
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,540
Slow down.

336
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,980
Slow down.

337
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,780
Big Brother.

338
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,340
Slow down.

339
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,420
I told you not to go in.

340
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,300
-Slow down.
 -Slowly.

341
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,740
Quick, come on out.

342
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,970
Slowly.

343
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,420
Baoyu.

344
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,380
Slow down.

345
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,980
Here.

346
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,060
Hang in there.

347
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,350
Why is Lu Feilong coming after

348
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,460
the two of you?

349
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,490
We were in Lanxi to investigate-

350
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,130
It hurts.

351
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,660
Slow down.

352
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,740
I owe Lu Feilong money after gambling.

353
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,420
A-an unlucky year.

354
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,820

355
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,850

Hang in there.

357
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,940
Weren't you enduring it pretty well just now?

358
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,780
When Lu Feilong came,

359
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,740
you didn't make a sound.

360
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,130
Who would dare to make a sound earlier?

361
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,780
If I even made a squeak, we'd be dead.

362
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,050
I wonder who on earth

363
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,510
was the one who put such a huge trap,

364
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,500
it hurts so bad!

365
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,140
It was you guys!

366
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,100
It was us.

367
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,590
If we put that in the mountains,

368
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,700
it could catch us a wild rabbit or a wild boar,

369
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,660
giving us some meat to eat.

370
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,100
Who knew you'd run into it?

371
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,070
T-then,

372
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,380
since your trap injured my leg,

373
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,260
you should get me a doctor.

374
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,340
We don't have money for a doctor.

375
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,460
If you don't mind,

376
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,060
you can stay here and recuperate.

377
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,020
Xiao Zhi and I will go forage for some herbs.

378
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,140
Father.

379
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,030
The food we have at home

380
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,610
might not be enough for so many people.

381
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,220
I have money.

382
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,540
I have money.

383
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,220
You can recuperate here.

384
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,140
If you want to treat it properly,

385
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,820
you'll have to go into the town of Tongyang County.

386
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,340
Come.

387
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,260
Shuai.

388
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,260
if others ask again,

389
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,180
make sure you don't say that

390
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,460
we are here in Lanxi to check the accounts.

391
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,770
And don't mention the fire in the Archives either.

392
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,020
Why?

393
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,500
You can never know a person's true intentions.

394
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,230
How would we know what other people

395
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,460
are thinking?

396
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,980
But the Chens saved us.

397
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,780
All the more we shouldn't tell them then.

398
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,700
We shouldn't put others into trouble.

399
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,579
I understand now.

400
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,700
My family has a shop in Tongyang.

401
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,980
Go there tomorrow morning with my letter

402
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,190
to get some money.

403
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,569
Then call a doctor here,

404
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,160
and also ask them

405
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,460
to send a letter to my sister.

406
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,000
When we fainted, we were still in

407
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,410
the Archives of Lanxi County.

408

Do you remember the book

423
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,900
I was telling you about?

It's called the 'Complete Works of the Silk Event'.

The number 3,530 was also written

on the first page of the book.

You know what I'm calculating?

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,500
This is a civil engineering math problem.

460
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,640
You are calculating

461
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,980
the storage capacity for the food storehouses.

462
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,500
This is to calculate the dimensions of the food supplies.

463
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,460
That's right.

464

Tongyang County's tax collection is coming up.

465

In order to manage all of the supplies smoothly,

466
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,400
we must determine the

467
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,780
storage capacity for the food storehouses.

468
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,350
The storehouse here

469
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,780
is shaped like a cylinder.

470
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,140
So we need to use the Cylindrical Method,

471
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,040
which is the square of the circumference,

472
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,980
times the height, divided by 12.

473

But at the top of the storehouse,

474
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,500
there is a canopy.

475
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,960

476
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,340
calculate this section accurately.

480
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,830

481

where you drew on the white wall,

482
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,400
and was quite impressed.

483
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,510
So I came back and tried to see

484
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,820
how I could apply it myself.

485
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,950
But alas, with my limited understanding,

486
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,500
there must have been some careless mistakes.

487
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,180
There are many careless mistakes,

488
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,540
and your understanding is indeed limited.

489
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,180
You are quite stupid too.

490

set up a spy

The song you just sang

512
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,640
was really nice.

513
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,100
Can you sing it again?

514
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,340
I’m not an entertainer,

515
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,370
why do I have to sing whenever you ask me to?

516
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,500
Bear with it.

517
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,020
It hurts.

518
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,980
I'll be gentle.

519
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,710
You're a man,

520
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,730
why are you complaining that it hurts?

521
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,940
If it doesn't hurt, and I say it hurts, that's being attention-seeking.

522
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,140
But now it really hurts,

523
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,570
so saying that means I'm being honest, okay?

524
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,790
Fine, since you're talking so much nonsense,

525
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,020
it seems like your condition isn't too serious.

526
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,890
All right.

527
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,950
When your friend

528
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,940
brings a doctor back,

529
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,690
we'll see if there's any

530
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,660
better medicine for you then.

531
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,070
You're saying,

532
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,340
Lu Feilong was the one who set fire to the Archives,

533
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,570
and you two were also abducted by him?

534
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,670
Yes.

535
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,680
This Mao Panfeng.

536
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,200
Regarding the issue with the silk poll tax,

537
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,460
he should be disputing it in court

538
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,840
openly and honestly.

539
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,520
He's gone too far

540
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,740
with these sneaky tactics.

541
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,390
It makes him seem like he's guilty and weak.

542
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,650
So you'll let me go?

543
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,010
I can't let you go.

544
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,900
As the eight counties of Jin'an

545
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,160
have an alliance to help each other,

546
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,680
if I let you go,

547
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,440
that'll be akin to digging my own grave.

548
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,120
Why?

549
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,050
What a person wants to do

550
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,350
is different from

551
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,530
what he has to do.

552
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,130
I really wish that

553
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,050
I could discuss the silk poll tax issue

554
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,230
with you openly

555
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,780
from an arithmetic perspective.

556
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,290
But I can't,

557
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,800
because the silk poll tax

558
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,270
is  disadvantageous to Tongyang County.

559
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,000
No matter how reasonable your arguments are,

560
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,510
I will have to do my best to oppose it.

561
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,820
We may be able to become friends,

562
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,710
but not right now.

563
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,110
I don't understand.

564
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,920
It's precisely because you don't understand

565
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,070
that I can air my grievances out to you.

566
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,890
Before I took up this position,

567
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,440
I was also full of hope and ambition.

568
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,630
I thought that since I’m the head of the county,

569
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,630
and the lord preceding over this land,

570
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,400
I could make the most of my abilities

571
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,660
and save the world.

572
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,040
But only when you really get to

573
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,970
sit in this position,

574
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,140
you will realize that

575
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,660
even just trying to manage this county properly

576
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,380
will exhaust all of your energy.

577
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,850
Take for example the junior officials

578
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,070
who work for me.

579
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,550
Their positions are passed down from generation to generation.

580
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,770
As for me,

581
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,150
I'm just an official that is expatriated here.

582
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,010
I have to rely on them, and guard against them at the same time.

583
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,860
If I take one slight misstep,

584
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,960
my reputation will be completely ruined.

585
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,030
I still don't understand.

586
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,120
Why don't you

587
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,180
draw it out on the wall for me?

588
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,230
You won't ever understand.

589
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,960
Anyway,

590
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,100
I won't let you go.

591
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,580
I will only detain you and transfer you back

592
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,090
according to the formal procedures.

593
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,560
If others ask,

594
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,160
I can only go against my conscience and say that

595
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,330
I know nothing about

596
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,550
what Lu Feilong did.

597
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,240
But I've already told you about it.

598
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,370
How could you not know?

599
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,570
As Xunzi once said,

600
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,310
water can carry a boat, but can also overturn it.

601
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,960
In Tongyang County,

602
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,810
I'm only a lone boat in the water.

603
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,080
If I go along with the current,

604
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,670
everyone will be fine.

605
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,650
If I go against the current,

606
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,610
I will drown to death.

607
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,850
So you don't know how to swim.

608
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,280
If I were as naive as you are,

609
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,420
how nice would that be?

610
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,810
Guards!

611
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,670
Take him away.

612
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:51,930
Move.

613
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,280
Do you want to know

614
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,620
the truth behind the silk poll tax?

615
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,190
The Archives in Lanxi County

616
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,870
have already been burned down.

617
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,340
What other evidence could you possibly have?

618
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,220
I've already thought of

619
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,230
a great idea.

620
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:03,770
Even without looking at

621
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,860
the Archives in Lanxi County,

622
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,750
we can still prove

623
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,800
the link between the provisions supplement

624
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
and the silk poll tax.

625
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,760
Fortunately, medicinal herbs were applied promptly.

626
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,410
Otherwise, you'd probably become a cripple.

627
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,300
The medicine I brought

628
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,720
will also help with your injury.

629
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,280
Brew it to drink every day,

630
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,240
and you will recover very soon.

631
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,060
Thank you.

632
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,910
You, take it.

633
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,590
The magistrate has ordered you two

634
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,690
to take good care of him.

635
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,620
You can't let him go,

636
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,090
and you can't let him

637
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,680
transmit any news outside.

638
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,250
Someone will come to take him in a few days.

639
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,510
What about Shuai?

640
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,690
I mean, Shuai Jiamo?

641
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,820
How is he?

642
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,000
You still have the time to care about others?

643
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,430
I'm leaving.

644
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,280
Okay, I'll see you off.

645
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,350
Just great,

646
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,520
you're a fugitive?

647
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,830
How dare you hide it from us?

648
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,340
I shouldn't have

649
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,520
let Shuai go alone.

650
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,990
He's just an arithmetic nut,

651
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,210
how could he complete the task?

652
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,030
Don't worry too much.

653
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,840
Since the magistrate sent a doctor

654
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,550
to take care of you,

655
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,640
and even left some money,

656
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,730
it means your friend

657
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,700
is probably fine too.

658
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,920
Don't worry and just focus on recovering.

659
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,870
No.

660
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:20,760
No.

661
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,350
I have to go to Tongyang.

662
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,040
What are you doing?

663
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,500
What are you...

664
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,050
You...

665
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,570
You...

666
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,830
What are you doing?

667
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,630
I just want to save my friend.

668
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,060
If you go down the mountain now,

669
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,610
your leg will be completely crippled.

670
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,790
The most important thing you should do now

671
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,470
is to make sure you recover from this injury.

672
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,140
I'll go brew the medicine.

673
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,410
Feilong.

674
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,530
Do you know what kind of people

675
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,830
I hate the most?

676
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,580
How long have you been with me?

677
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,470
People who don't put in effort into doing things.

678
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,590
Master Fan.

679
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,240
Magistrate Deng just sent us a document

680
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,080
saying that of Shuai and Feng,

681
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,220
one of them has been caught,

682
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,570
and the other will also be arrested soon.

683
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,220
Magistrate Deng is indeed one of us.

684
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,190
He doesn't dilly-dally in his tasks.

685
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,330
This time, I'll personally go to get them.

686
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,800
I'll make sure not to mess up.

687
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,940
Master Fan.

688
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,700
I’ll go get ready now.

689
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,830
As soon as they're brought back here,

690
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,840
we will begin the trial immediately,

691
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,240
and make sure they won't be able to dispute the charges.

692
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,200
No need for that.

693
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,850
We should have killed them off earlier,

694
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,150
then there wouldn't have been

695
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,330
so much trouble.

696
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,900
I had given you a chance to.

697
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,300
[Tongyang County Office]

698
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,250
This is truly a brilliant approach.

699
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,850
Working backwards from

700
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,530
the figures for conscripted labor to calculate tax revenue,

701
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,590
this is truly revolutionary,

702
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,020
and lets us see the full picture with something small.

703
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,990
The other day during the debate,

704
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,750
you tried to refute my argument by bringing up the porter fees.

705
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,850
That's where I got the inspiration from.

706
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,280
It's an honor for me then.

707
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,770
But while your algorithm here

708
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,200
sounds simple,

709
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,710
the actual calculation

710
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,100
will be a painstaking task.

711
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,320
Think about it.

712
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,380
We will need to calculate the numbers

713
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,130
for each and every county,

714
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,940
and then merge it together and divide.

715
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,950
It's quite complicated.

716
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,960
It's not difficult. Leave the calculations to me.

717
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,260
It won't take long.

718
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,790
You're really such an arithmetic nut.

719
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,720
You're not even on guard at all.

720
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,480
Aren't you afraid that

721
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,610
I can prepare in advance

722
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,750
after getting to know your approach?

723
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,090
If you have a method of calculation

724
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,020
that makes more sense than this,

725
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,190
isn't it more interesting for us to

726
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,370
compare and discuss?

727
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,190
Shuai Jiamo.

728
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,080
Listen to my advice.

729
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,850
The key to reforming

730
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,610
the silk poll tax

731
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,780
was never

732
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,920
an issue of calculations.

733
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,400
It's an issue of benefits.

734
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,820
What do you mean?

735
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,130
No one will calculate

736
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,260
these details with you.

737
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,940
They're competing in terms of schemes,

738
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,990
and benefits are what they are after.

739
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,250
Even for me,

740
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,130
I can only discuss these things

741
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,220
with you in private.

742
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,980
Once we're in front of the officials,

743
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,990
no matter how good your arguments are,

744
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,840
I will never acknowledge it.

745
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:51,930
As you said,

746
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,680
my method of calculation is correct.

747
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,520
Why won't you acknowledge it?

748
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,910
Correct?

749
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,510
Do you know that

750
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,150
even though the Yellow Book of Tax and Labor

751
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,750
is the standard for recording population changes,

752
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,800
it has long become

753
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,970
a useless pile of paper.

754
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,740
The numbers inside are all hypothetical,

755
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,830
it's just a perfunctory effort for the court.

756
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,800
Basing your calculations on the Yellow Book of Tax and Labor

757
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,320
will never give you the correct results.

758
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,050
Then how does Jin'an Prefecture conscript laborers?

759
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,660
If the prefecture and county

760
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,200
really intend to conscript laborers,

761
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,810
they would compile a White Book of Tax and Labor

762
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,960
on their own.

763
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,820
The numbers inside are the real deal.

764
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,760
White Book of Tax and Labor...

765
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,520
But do you think

766
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,530
they will show you

767
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,490
the White Book?

768
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,040
In this world,

769
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,930
the human mind is more complicated than arithmetic.

770
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,120
No.

771
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,550
There's one type of arithmetic that is

772
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,370
harder to grasp than the human mind.

773
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,470
I still haven't figured it out to this day.

774
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,600
Which is that?

775
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,030
Magistrate Deng,

776
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,460
you must be quite familiar with

777
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,340
methods of measuring the fields.

778
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,520
As a magistrate,

779
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,620
it's common sense to understand how to measure fields.

780
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,460
Fields of land can be categorized by their shape into

781
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,560
rectangular, triangular, trapezoidal,

782
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,440
circular segments, and right-angled trapezoidal fields.

783
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,080
But there's another type of strange field,

784
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,340
that is extremely irregular in shape,

785
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,180
making it extremely difficult to calculate.

786
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,440
When I was a child,

787
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,950
I have a faint memory of my father

788
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,120
telling me about a solution for this,

789
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,810
called the Art of Gathering Projected Steps.

790
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,320
It allows you to work out

791
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,630
the solution in the blink of an eye,

792
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,220
which helps in tackling this type of irregular field.

793
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,110

Unfortunately, I was too young then.

I only remember

796
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,320
having to draw a grid to calculate,

797
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,560
and taking the vertices of the field.

and did make some breakthroughs.

But I still can't figure it out.

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,230
and also my job.

00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,580
The silk poll tax?

847
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,400
Did you stir up the silk poll tax case

848
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,290
just because of this number?

849
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,190
Ever since I was young,

850
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,750
there was always

851
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,140
a question I had no answers to in my heart.

852
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,470
Why wasn't I home that day

853
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,110
when my house was on fire?

854
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,380
If it was really as Cheng Renqing said,

855
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,360
that my parents committed suicide to escape punishment,

856
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,000
then why did they

857
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,720
leave me here?

858
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,480
What happened to your parents

859
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,860
was truly regrettable.

860
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,060
But listen to my advice.

861
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,740
Don't be too obsessed with this.

862
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,880
When it comes to the matter of the silk poll tax,

863
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,100
the two of us are on opposing ends.

864
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,450
But people like you

865
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,960
with such a pure heart,

866
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,440
are rare to come by these days.

867
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,540
I really admire you.

868
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,300
But I've only been here for two years.

869
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,270
I don't know too much about

870
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,230
what happened in the past.

871
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,330
But Chief Bookkeeper Ren of Wancheng

872
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,210
is a local.

873
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,730
Maybe he knows a little about

874
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,990
what happened before.

875
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,300
You will need to pass by Wancheng

876
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,180
on your way back to Lanxi from Tongyang.

877
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,440
I'll write a letter.

878
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,160
You can go ask him.
