00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,080
I decided

172
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,080
to arrive in Jin'an a few days in advance.

173
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,920
I don't mean anything else.

174
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,680
I just wanted to have a look around

175
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,990
and get to know

176
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,040
the local customs in Jin'an.

177
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,040
Did I cause you

178
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,480
any trouble?

179
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,080
Not at all.

180
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
If only all the officials of the Ming

181
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,080
could be like you,

182
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,160
going to the people

183
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,160
and trying to understand their suffering.

184
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,610
All under heaven would be peaceful.

185
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,840
The seas would be calm, and the Yellow River would be clear.

186
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,440
Magistrate Fang, you flatter me.

187
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,520
Since I am watching over Jin'an

188
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,960
on behalf of the Ming,

189
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,850
it is only right that I do my best

190
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,640
until the day I die.

191
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,600
You scoundrel!

192
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,200
Why are you here again?

193
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,290
This is the Prefectural Office’s affair,

194
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,960
you should report it there.

195
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,420
The Prefectural Office said

196
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,000
they only accept documents from county offices.

197
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,880
The tax was paid in vain,

198
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,250
so the plaint should be raised by the county.

199
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,930
You can go to the person who said that.

200
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,360
They asked me to come to you.

201
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,480
Guards, drag him out!

202
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,760
What are you doing?

203
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,600
Where is this?

204
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,160
Sir.

205

206

how inappropriate!

207
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,600
You again?

208
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,440
Sir.

209
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,800
This arithmetic nut

210
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,210
has going mad for some reason.

211
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,500
He insists that there is a problem

212
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,540
with the tax payment in our county.

213
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,690
Yes, there is a problem.

214
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,720
Let me show you.

215
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,440
You mean

216
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,320
there is something wrong

217
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,240
with tax affairs in Renhua County?

218
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,000
Xu Kang, the County Magistrate of Wujiang, sent a greeting card.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,320
He says that he is too busy to come in person

220
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,670
and asks your forgiveness.

221
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,200
Throw away all the greeting cards.

222
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,210
Yes.

223
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,130
It's okay.

224
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:34,800
Old Master.

225
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,360
Jin'an Prefecture's reputation is well-deserved, isn't it?

226
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,560
Even though I have assumed office,

227
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,100
these county magistrates

228
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,880
dare delay their meetings with me.

229
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,640
They must be in on it together

230
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,400
to teach me a lesson.

231
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,530
Be careful.

232
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,400
Yes, Old Master.

233
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,570
Why don't you

234
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,840
go down to the counties

235
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,990
and show them who's boss?

236
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,200
I am not allowed to

237
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
enter any of the counties without permission.

238
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,790
I can't even go to

239
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,400
the Renhua County Office next door.

240

Otherwise,

241

the Censors will remonstrate against me

242

for leaving my post.

00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,160
Okay.

It's turbid in here.

It's time to clean up.

The other county magistrates

258
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,120
really won't come to pay their respects?

refute that?

with taxation in our county

A mistake?

What mistake?

276

is overpaying our taxes every year.

He might be hurt.

343
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,080
-Be careful. -Come on.

344
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,960
Let's go.

345
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,670
You're just a commoner.

346
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,020
How did you know

347
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,160
there's a problem in Jin'an Prefecture?

348
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,200
At first,

349
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,240
I found that the acreage of the fields I measured

350
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,000
did not tally with the numbers on the title deeds.

351
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,320
Later,

352
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,880
when I was doing accounting for the gambling house,

353
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,060
I found it was the same

354
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,960
for them.

355
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,320
So I went to the Archives

356
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,920
to check the official records

357
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,160
in the fish-scale map registers.

358
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,210
How did you find out

359
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,980
about the Silk Poll Tax

360
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,320
from there?

361
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,920
I don't know how

362
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,600
I found out about it

363
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,770
either.

364
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,400
The problem with the Silk Poll Tax,

365
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,360
the evidence I found,

366
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,600
and my process of deduction

367
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,280
are all written on this memorandum.

368
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,000
My hands are full of oil.

369
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
Just tell me.

370
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,840
To put it simply,

371
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,280
in the taxes

372
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,400
Renhua County submits to Jin'an Prefecture

373
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,640
every year,

374
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,120
there is an extra sum of

375
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,930
3,530 taels of silver

376
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,670
that should be voided.

377
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,880
If

378
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,960
the 3,530 taels

379
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,000
is a mistake,

380
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,240
it'll be a good thing

381
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,080
to void it.

382
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,240
Everyone will be happy.

383
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,670
Why did they flog Shuai?

384
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,680
What's Magistrate Fang's nickname?

385
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,720
Statue Fang.

386
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,520
Yes.

387
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,400
He doesn't do anything,

388
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,650
all he wants is peace and quiet.

389
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,360
Now that a new Prefect is here,

390
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,370
all the more he doesn't want

391
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,210
this kind of thing

392
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:52,960
to cause him trouble.

393
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,470
All right.

394
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,520
Sorry.

395
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,360
Clean it up.

396
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,920
Let's make this clear.

397
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:15,910
Dummy.

398
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,680
We support you in filing the plaint.

399
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,369
We must pay

400
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,150
what should be paid.

401
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,040
We must not pay

402
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,599
what we shouldn't.

403
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,790
No, Sister.

404
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,940
Shuai has already been flogged

405
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,840
ten times.

406
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,570
If he tries to file a plaint again,

407
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,850
he'll be flogged ten more times.

408
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,500
Six times.

409
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,800
Look at Tripitaka.

410
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,890
He brought his purple gold bowl

411
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,280
and retrieved the sutra.

412
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,680
This is more than 3,000 taels.

413
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,680
It should wake Statue Fang up.

414
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,110
Dummy.

415
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,790
Let me ask you.

416
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,170
If you have a chance to meet the county magistrate,

417
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,940
will you go?

418
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,530
Yes.

419
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,410
Are you afraid of being flogged?

420
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,200
No.

421
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,930
Okay.

422
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,960
But you need to recuperate.

423
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,600
Let's go together when you're fully recovered.

424
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,510
Let's go.

425
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,800
Baoyu.

426
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,760
I have never

427
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,690
thought about wanting you

428
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,000
to excel in the imperial examinations.

429
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,520
But we need to at least

430
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,080
have a good reputation in Renhua.

431
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,480
This is your chance.

432
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,850
The Silk Poll Tax

433
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,890
that Dummy found out about

434
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,520
is definitely not a trivial matter.

435
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,080
If it's corrected,

436
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,040
think about it,

437
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,220
wouldn't it be a good thing

438
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,200
for all the people

439
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,440
of Renhua?

440
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,570
Yes.

441
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,940
If the people of Renhua

442
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,650
find out that

443
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,880
you had a part in it,

444
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,400
wouldn't they feel indebted

445
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
to our family?

446
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,980
But Shuai was the one

447
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,790
who found out about this.

448
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,600
What does it have to do with me?

449
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,970
You know

450
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,320
he is an arithmetic nut.

451
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,240
He doesn't know how to express himself.

452
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,120
Look, hasn't the county office

453
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,040
kicked him out?

454
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,120
He needs an intermediary,

455
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,960
someone who will communicate with others for him.

456
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,210
But this—

457
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,680
But what?

458
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,600
I understand.

459
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,680
Do you remember

460
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,040
when Dummy was little,

461
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,000
he carved a number using counting rods

462
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,560
on the wall?

463
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,160
Yes.

464
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,080
Do you remember what it was?

465
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,510
Who can remember that?

466
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,240
I didn't think much of it at first.

467
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,100
But today,

468
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,330
I took this lantern

469
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,750
and looked at it carefully.

470
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,920
Guess what I found.

471
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,640
What?

472
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,520
[3,530]

473
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,960
The number on the wall

474
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,950
is the same

475
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,950
[3,530]

476
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,400
as the number for the Silk Poll Tax.

477
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,830
It's 3,530.

478
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,320
Dummy isn't a dummy.

479
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,800
He has his reasons for doing this.

480
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,020
[3,530]

481
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,350
[3,530]

482
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,880
[Plaintiff Feng Baoyu and Defendant Shuai Jiamo]

483
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,190
Magistrate Fang,

484
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,640
I, Feng Baoyu,

485
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,000
am suing Shuai Jiamo for assault.

486
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,230
What caused the conflict

487
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,160
between you and the defendant?

488
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,080
Why did you fight?

489
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,800
Tell me the truth.

490
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,730
Magistrate Fang,

491
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,050
we quarreled because of

492
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,480
the mistake in taxation in Jin'an Prefecture.

493
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,950
Because of what?

494
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,450
We quarreled

495
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,210
over taxation in Renhua County.

496
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,770
He insisted that our county

497
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,880
is paying 3,600 taels in excess every year.

498
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,310
3,530 taels.

499
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,080
Yes.

500
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,490
He insisted that our county

501
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,360
is paying 3,530 taels of silver in excess

502
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,480
every year,

503
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,550
which should be voided.

504
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,240
But according to my calculations,

505
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,800
it's only 3,510 taels.

506
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,040
We calculated differently,

507
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,880
so we fought.

508
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,430
Say something.

509
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,760
Everyone!

510
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,330
No matter what the correct sum is,

511
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,840
it's a lot, isn't it?

512
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,280
-Yes. -Yes.

Every year, regular taxes in Jin'an Prefecture

are divided into summer taxes and autumn grains.

Of course it's a waste of money.

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,080
Why not?

684
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,190
I, Shuai Jiamo,

685
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,800
would like to file a plaint

686
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,840
regarding the unequal payment of a shared tax

687
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,360
on behalf of Renhua County.

688
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,720
To file a plaint,

689
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,960
you have to have

690
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,080
an official title.

691
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,550
As a commoner,

692
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,800
you are not qualified.

693
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,230
We are.

694
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,800
This is

695
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,750
Feng Baoyu.

696
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,840
He's a Government Student in our county.

697
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,920
Go.

698
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,080
Go.

699
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,680
I'm a Supplementary Student of the 3rd-class

700
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,920
in Renhua County.

701
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,760
I am willing to stake my scholarly honor

702
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,080
on filing this plaint

703
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,320
together with Shuai Jiamo!

704
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,120
-Good! -Good!

705
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,010
That's great.

706
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:02,640
How's that?

707
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,520
Isn't that great?

708
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,600
Alright!

709
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,240
Think carefully.

710
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,120
Even if the lawsuit is successful,

711
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,480
even if Renhua

712
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,910
is exempted from the tax,

713
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,600
none of it

714
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,160
will fall into your hands.

715
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,840
We only want to correct the mistake.

716
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:22,960
My family

717
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,000
has enough money.

718
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,320
You- You won't give it more thought?

719
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,000
Everyone!

720
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,920
If there are eight brothers,

721
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,610
shouldn't they

722
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,520
take care of their parents together?

723
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,880
Yes.

724
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,610
In the end,

725
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,410
one of them found out that

726
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,450
he was the only one

727
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,100
paying for them.

728
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,400
They agreed

729
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,650
that the eight butchers

730
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,440
will settle a jin each.

731
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,450
In the end,

732
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,880
the seven other brothers

733
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,810
didn't spend a penny.

734
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,250
The County School takes all eight jin

735
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,200
from you.

736
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,120
Do you think it makes sense?

737
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,550
No.

738
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,330
If anyone dares to touch my meat,

739
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,720
I'll kill him!

740
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,170
Fortunately, in our county,

741
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,280
there are two heroes who spoke up for us!

742
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,490
One is called Shuai Jiamo.

743
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,320
He's an expert in arithmetic,

744
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,880
yin-yang philosophy,

745
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,090
as well as prognostication.

746
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,880
The other one

747
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,200
is Feng Baoyu.

748
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,760
He is well-educated.

749
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,450
What else? Go on.

750
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,640
Go on.

751
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,440
Luckily,

752
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,000
Feng Baoyu was taught well at home since childhood.

753
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,840
He has always been kind and virtuous,

754
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,840
with a strong sense of heroism and justice.

755
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,240
When he sees injustice,

756
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,450
he will definitely lend a hand.

757
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,360
That is to say

758
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,840
Shuai Jiamo's clever calculations right the wrongs,

759
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,800
and Feng Baoyu borrows the bill to help his neighbors.

760
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,400
-Bravo! -Bravo!

761
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,040
Folks, come here.

762
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,020
Our Young Master

763
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,170
was meticulous enough to prepare

764
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:14,940
these notes on the Jin'an taxation case

765
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,180
for all of you.

766
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,520
Take it home and have a look.

767
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,170
There's enough for everyone.

768
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,530
[Regular Tax in Jin'an Prefecture]

769
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,390
[100 years, 35,300]

770
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,360
Interesting.

771
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,040
Interesting.

772
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,800
So this is how

773
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,630
I can break the deadlock.

774
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,280
The higher-ups aren't listening to our explanations,

775
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,400
the ones in the middle level cannot be convinced,

776
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,080
and the subordinates are disobedient.

777
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,040
I wanted to govern by inaction.

778
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,120
Can I stick to inaction?

779
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,740
Can I govern?

780
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,360
I...

781
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,440
It’s really hard for me.

782
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,600
Old Master,

783
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,880
I have a perfect plan.

784
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,200
You can send a notice, saying that...

785
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,940
Our county has always

786
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,430
[Seventh year, fifth month of the Wanli reign, Renhua County Magistrate]

787
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,400
put the welfare of the people first.

788
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,160
We will investigate the matter carefully.

789
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,200
As it concerns taxation, money, and grains,

790
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,760
it is a serious matter.

791
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,080
We must go about it solemnly and meticulously,

792
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,520
such that nothing falls through the cracks.

793
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,240
The people and troops of Renhua must stand down

794
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,800
and not be taken in by rumors.

795
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,480
What do you think?

796
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,320
Master Fan.

797
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,770
Statue Fang is really

798
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,960
a master of delaying tactics.

799
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,720
He talks a good game,

800
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,400
but doesn't actually do anything.

801
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,410
It's like an antelope hanging by the antlers, leaving no tracks to be found.

802
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,760
He has managed to

803
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,720
weasel his way out of this huge problem again.

804
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,760
I'm not talking about that.

805
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm asking

806
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,480
how does my book cover look?

807
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,880
Master Fan.

808
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,570
You even handle trivial matters like wrapping up books

809
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,680
yourself.

810
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,030
I'm truly

811
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,640
in admiration.

812
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,840
You shouldn't touch

813
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,080
the silk.

814
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,000
That's not what I meant.

815
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,200
I mean

816
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,560
we shouldn't meddle with the silk tax.

817
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:25,920
Master Fan,

818
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,680
I understand what you mean.

819
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,000
The silk tax concerns the prefect,

820
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,960
the eight counties, and tens of thousands of commoners.

821
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,120
If we want to abolish it,

822
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,200
the government will refuse.

823
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,040
If we want to apportion it, the eight counties will refuse.

824
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,200
If we want to keep collecting it as is,

825
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,520
the commoners will refuse.

826
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
There's no solution.

827
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,880
Whoever meddles with it is done for.

828
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,520
The only way out

829
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,000
is to drag it out.

830
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,640
Have you seen the notice

831
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,610
for this year's provincial examinations?

832
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,400
Yes.

833
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,400
Since Emperor Taizu's establishment of the examinations,

834
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,520
Jin'an Prefecture

835
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,960
has had

836
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,800
180 presented scholars

837
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,920
and

838
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,890
437 provincial graduates,

839
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,480
of which 30%

840
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,720
have been from here, Lanxi.

841
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,440
Yes.

842
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,200
The reason why Jin'an Prefecture is prosperous

843
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,160
lies here,

844
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,920
in respecting and loving books.

845
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,680
Fang Maozhen.

846
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,590
He's lazy,

847
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,200
really lazy.

848
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,640
But he's smart,

849
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,880
really smart.

850
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,600
Master Fan,

851
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,860
you’re knowledgeable,

852
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,200
having been in the capital.

853
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,680
The tricks here in the backwaters

854
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,230
can't fool you.

855
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,280
It doesnt count

856
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,920
when a brute from the countryside

857
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,550
speaks about serious matters.

858
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,640
But

859
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,680
there is some history

860
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,400
between Shuai Jiamo and I.

861
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,920
Please take care of him.

862
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:03,760
Master Fan.

863
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,690
You know that arithmetic nut?

864
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,639
It was from 20 years ago.

865
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,000
Wonderful.

866
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm talking about chess.

867
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,560
Recently,

868
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,440
the silk tax case

869
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,880
has been the talk of the town.

870
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,560
I just wanted to check in.

871
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,920
Magistrate Fang,

872
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,639
how is the investigation going?

873
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,190
There is something wrong with Shuai Jiamo.

874
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,480
What he found

875
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,840
may not be true.

876
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,639
We can't trust him completely.

877
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,880
You are so busy.

878
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,480
Let me

879
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,070
confirm the details,

880
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,360
and report them to you.

881
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,080
Alright.

882
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,520
Let Shuai Jiamo investigate.

883
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,040
I want results

884
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,360
within a month.

885
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,760
When that time comes,

886
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,400
I will judge the case together with you.

887
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,280
Good move!

888
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,840
Good move.

889
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,440
Mr. Shuai.

890
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,890
I know quite a lot

891
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,200
about money and grains.

892
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,920
How do you plan to investigate?

893
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,310
This time, I want to investigate

894
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,160
the archives of the eight counties of Jin'an.

895
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,000
Do you want to see them all?

896
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,240
No.

897
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,280
We don't have time for that.

898
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,230
I have an idea.

899
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,240
This time,

900
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,920
we'll start from Renhua,

901
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,320
Tongyang, Wancheng,

902
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,840
and Lanxi.

903
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,200
We'll start with these four counties.

904
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,440
I want the records

905
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,310
for all summer and autumn taxes

906
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,120
from the Chenghua era to the beginning of the Wanli era.

907
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,840
So much?

908
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,080
Can you finish?

909
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,390
I'm afraid it'll take a long time.

910
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,480
Okay.

911
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,560
There's no hurry.

912
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,750
Take your time.

913
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,000
If one month is not enough,

914
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,200
then take three months.

915
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,840
If three months isn't enough,

916
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,160
then take half a year!

917
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,600
Five months?

918
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,840
There will be results within five days.

919
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,400
Five- Five- Five days?
