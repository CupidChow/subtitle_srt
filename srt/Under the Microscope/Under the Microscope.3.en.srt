6,000 bolts of silk

was worth exactly 3,530 taels.

[Jin'an Prefecture, Silk Tax, 6,000 bolts]

You mean to say

346
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,830
the Silk Poll Tax

347

is the provisions supplement

that should have been paid for

by the entire Jin'an Prefecture?

351

Yes.

352
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,800
This is justice.

353
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,480
Your brother is public-minded.

354
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,660
He speaks frankly for the people.

355
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,500
He is a role model for all of us scholars.

356
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,340
Stop.

357
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,960
Who was it that called my brother

358
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,720
a playboy,

359
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,770
unambitious,

360
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,830
and a bad influence

for you scholars?

362
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,100
I was wrong.

I'm seeing him again

in a new light.

365
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,550
The playboy of the past

366
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,100
has stepped forward

367
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,400
to serve the needs of the people.

368
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,590
You must have taught him well.

369
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,680
That is correct.

370
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,110
Ms. Feng.

371
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,750
This road

372
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,940
is not an easy one.

373
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,920
Why?

374
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,110
These three magistrates don't usually come here,

375
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,880
but they came to report in out of the blue.

376
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,400
Do you think this is a coincidence?

377
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,290
Ms. Feng,

378
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,010
these visitors are ill-intentioned.

379
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,270
Your brother

380
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,370
will have to suffer.

381
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,370
But if

382
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,480
our arithmetic nut didn't make a mistake with his calculations,

383
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,510
there should be no problem. Right?

384
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,700
May I ask

385
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,550
where and who

386
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,490
this arithmetic nut

387
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,050
learned his arithmetic from?

388
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,850
Why do you

389
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,200
trust him so much?

390
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,480
There's something you don't know.

391
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,940
Jiamo's father

392
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,380
was also famous

393
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,610
for being a master of arithmetic.

394
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,100
These are the copies I made

395
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,400
of the eight counties' account books

396
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,700
from the 9th to the 16th year

397
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,000
of the Chenghua reign.

398
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,790
What do you want us to see?

399
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,340
The point is not what we can see.

400
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,560
The point is what we can't see.

401
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,910
What do you mean?

402
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,750

supplement for provisions in silk

406
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,110
was that Renhua County

407
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,290
was in charge of 1,500 bolts

408
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,300
and the seven other counties

409
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,560
were in charge of 4,500 bolts.

410
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,730
This was clearly recorded

411
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,080
every year.

412
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,420
It was paid every year.

413
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,930
But the tax registers

414
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,240
for the 12th to the 15th year of the Chenghua reign

415
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,500
are missing.

416
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,180
I searched the Archives,

417
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,570
but I couldn't find them.

418
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,750
It is common

419
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,130
for there to be damage to the registers

420
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,310
from insect infestations.

421
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,950
The register for the 16th year of the Chenghua reign is still there.

422
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,540
But when I checked it,

423
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,510
there is no record

424
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
in the seven other counties

425
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,450
of this

426
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,000
4,500 bolts of provisions supplement in silk.

427
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,180
At the same time,

428
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,610
in Renhua County's records,

429
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,450
a Silk Poll Tax

430
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,130
appeared out of the blue.

431
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,270
The amount

432
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,750
is 3,530 taels.

433
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,920
[Jin'an Prefecture, 6,000 bolts of silk tax, Provisions supplement for resisting the Japanese]

434
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,380
So,

435
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,690
what do you think?

436
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,470
I suspect

437
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,849
that sometime after

438
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:08,819
the 11th year of the Chenghua reign,

439
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,170
someone

440
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,349
recast this tax

441
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,230
to deceive the whole world,

442
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,190
and transferred it all

443
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,200
to Renhua County.

444
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,079
Therefore,

445
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,440
the accounts for Jin'an Prefecture still match up,

446
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,700
but the taxpayers

447
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,500
have changed.

448
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,690
Nonsense!

449
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,540
Do you think you can fool the people

450
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,430
by writing down these numbers?

451
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,670
The documents we distributed just now

452
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,220
were copied from the original records

453
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,980
in the Archives.

454
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,110
There are indices on them,

455
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,870
you can verify them at any time.

456
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,720
Since the records for several intervening years

457
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,770
are missing,

458
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,370
isn't it too hasty

459
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,260
for you to make such a conclusion?

460
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,160
The calculations are ingenius.

461
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,300
You're an official,

462
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,890
I'm afraid you won't understand them.

463

Magistrate Fang.

464
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,720
Is this a student from your county?

465
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,830
Feng Baoyu, shut up!

466
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,600
Do you know that Magistrate Deng

467
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,000
used to be a famous prodigy?

468
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,220
When he was an Observer at the Ministry of Works,

469
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,940
he could calculate the expenses

470
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,460
for the Yellow River's flood management for the whole year

471
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,810
by heart,

472
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,190
without a single mistake.

473
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,630
His Majesty personally praised him.

474
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,770
This sum

475
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,650
of 3,530 taels

476
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,080
appears repeatedly in the account books.

477
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,340
Something must be up.

478
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,370
What do you think?

479
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,620
Baoyu.

480
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,810
Your scholarly honor.

481
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,470
I, Feng Baoyu, a Government Student of Renhua,

482
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,110
suggest

483
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,830
this 3,530 taels

484
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,960
of the Silk Poll Tax

485
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,770
not be borne

486
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,780
by Renhua County alone,

487
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,040
but be apportioned

488
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,470
to the eight counties.

489
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,390
This explanation is very unique.

490
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,330
It's clear and easy to understand.

491
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,850
Magistrate Fang,

492
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,790
has this student ever served as a Clerk

493
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,840
in the Secretariat?

494
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:09,820
Him?

495
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,420
He hasn’t.

496
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,300
He-

497
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,240
just likes this.

498
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,580
I don't think so.

499
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,600
In order to save some money

500
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,110
for your county,

501
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,530
you've really

502
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,220
pulled out all the stops.

503
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,020
Magistrate Mao.

504
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,110
Your- Your words

505
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,290
are hurtful.

506
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,010
These copies and documents

507
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,450
can be verified in the Archives.

508
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,500
These are not my baseless claims.

509
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,510
Everyone knows

510
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,400
Jin'an Prefecture and Renhua County

511
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,330
share the same Archives.

512
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,010
If you weren't behind this,

513
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,950
was it Prefect Huang

514
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,500
who had let Shuai Jiamo in?

515
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,050
Magistrate Mao.

516
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,680
That is right.

517
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:58,870
Yes.

518
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,760
I think...

519
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,200
I mentioned it in passing.

520
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,990
Why are you so honest?

521
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,510
That's right.

522
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,250
Prefect Huang,

523
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,480
we have come

524
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,740
to report to you.

525
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,220
If we bring a ridiculous tax back with us

526
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,730
out of nowhere,

527
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,950
how can we explain it

528
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,130
to the people under our governance?

529
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,140
Yes!

530
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,270
-We are here... -Everyone!

531
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,130
Calm down, everyone.

532
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,640
We have yet to make a judgement

533
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,820
on whether what Shuai Jiamo has said

534
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,910
is reasonable or not.

535
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,420
This is a serious matter.

536
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,480
It needs to be carefully evaluated.

537
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,910
Prefect Huang,

538
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,850
it's almost noon.

539
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,650
Why not we proceed to the inner room

540
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,450
for lunch?

541
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,980
We can continue to discuss this after lunch.

542
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,020
Yes.

543
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,730
Let's eat.

544
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,620
Let's eat first.

545
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,960
Alright.

546
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,890
We'll eat.

547
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,370
I didn't expect

548
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,630
this Shuai Jiamo's background

549
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,140
to be so rough.

550
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,650
This fire

551
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,290
that took his parents from him

552
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,050
was what made him like this.

553
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,250
He doesn't understand human sentiments, only arithmetic.

554
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,300
I feel sorry for him.

555
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,860
As Laozi once said,

556
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,920
"When one's virtue is constant, one returns to the state of a baby."

557
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,550
This is a truly

558
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,600
natural state.

559
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,490
It's also a kind of happiness.

560
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,660
I don't know whether you have

561
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,680
reached enlightenment,

562
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,370
or if you're just a sweet-talker.

563
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,660
Sir,

564
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,190
Master Fan wants to see you.

565
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,830
"The tree hopes for calm, but the wind won't stop."

566
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,310
What- What tree?

567
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,660
Money tree.

568
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,510
Ms. Feng.

569
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,140
I'll take my leave now.

570
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,540
You're not waiting for the judgement?

571
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,430
What judgement?

572
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,190
I'm afraid today is just

573
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,700
the beginning.

574
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,460
This is a time-honored brand in Renhua,

575
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,680
Feng’s Ham.

576
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,460
I have specially prepared it for all of you.

577
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,770
Prefect Huang

578
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,490
refuses to even eat with us.

579
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,590
Do you think he already knows

580
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,890
you were the one

581
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,740
who secretly asked us to come?

582
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,010
He's allowed to let Shuai Jiamo sneak into the Archives.

583
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,320
Am I not allowed to invite a few

584
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,830
helping hands?

585
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,680
If this silk tax

586
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,610
can be voided,

587
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,370
Renhua County will be able to save

588
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,880
over 3,000 taels every year.

589
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,990
Are you really not interested?

590
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,420
Gaining this

591
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,990
will give me a disaster in the long run.

592
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,170
We can’t verify

593
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,640
what happened 100 years ago.

594
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,570
If you let Prefect Huang

595
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,790
seize this chance

596
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,270
to disrupt our rapport,

597
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,160
in the future,

598
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,420
he will cause trouble

599
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,550
constantly.

600
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,650
In comparison,

601
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,210
this 3,000 taels of silver

602
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,640
is nothing.

603
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,810
Brother Fang,

604
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,090
you truly understand the bigger picture.

605
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,270
I just like peace and inaction,

606
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,990
and minimizing trouble.

607
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,630
Minimizing trouble.

608
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,300
Good.

609
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,480
Then, we have a deal.

610
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,710
This afternoon, we will work together

611
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,890
to refute Shuai Jiamo's

612
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,070
nonsense.

613
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,260
What he said

614
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,770
seems reasonable,

615
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,070
but is actually absurd.

616
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,470
It won't be hard

617
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,770
to refute.

618
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,610
Good!

619
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,740
Very good!

620
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,880
Ren-

621
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,560
Old Mister Ren!

622
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,330
Stop sleeping!

623
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,010
The sun is setting!

624
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,950
Prefect Huang.

625
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,420
Don't stand on ceremony.

626
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,080
Shuai.

627
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,320
It's okay.

628
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,750
I just came here for a stroll

629
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,760
after eating lunch.

630
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,230
Go on.

631
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,010
Shuai Jiamo.

632
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,070
In the afternoon,

633
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,200
I'll find an opening.

634
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,500
You must seize the chance

635
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,300
and cooperate well

636
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,600
to make the seven counties

637
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,240
open their Archives,

638
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,210
so that we can investigate.

639
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,010
Indeed.

640
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,480
I need more primary data

641
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,620
to prove my argument.

642
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,350
This interpretation...

643
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,370
is fine.

644
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,890
It's fine.

645
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,160
Enjoy your meal.

646
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,290
Take care, Prefect Huang.

647
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,040
Later, don't say

648
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,470
I asked you to say it.

649
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,780
Say what?

650
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,640
Making the seven counties

651
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,030
open their Archives.

652
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,620
Okay.

653
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,550
I'll tell them you forbade me from telling them.

654
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,750
No- Huang-

655
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,010
Prefect Huang, calm down.

656
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,940
Calm down.

657
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,450
I'll teach him later.

658
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,950
Prefect Huang, take care.

659
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:14,620
[Jin'an Prefecture, Silk tax, 6,000 bolts]

660
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,380
The origins

661
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,470
of the Silk Poll Tax

662
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,370
have been made clear by Shuai Jiamo

663
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,630
this morning.

664
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,140
All the county magistrates are here.

665
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,900
Let's discuss

666
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,040
how to deal with the matter.

667
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,850
I read the documents carefully just now.

668
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,080
I found that Mr. Shuai

669
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,630
could pick out the information he needed

670
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,640
at an eye

671
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,240
from such complicated accounts.

672
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,390
He's truly a genius at arithmetic.

673
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,940
He's praising you.

674
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,910
What's more admirable is

675
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,510
how he made up a story

676
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,570
based on the accounts.

677
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,370
He's quite capable,

678
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,210
but his efforts were misplaced.

679
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,550
Why aren't you speaking?

680
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,020
You didn't ask a question,

681
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,120
how should I answer?

682
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,330
You should know

683
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,550
the difference between principal form and converted form taxes

684
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,570
in the Ming's tax system.

685
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,870
Principal form taxes

686
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,930
are paid in goods

687
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,930
such as grains and cloth.

688
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,820
Converted form taxes are paid in silver.

689
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,380
Very good.

690
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,230
Let me continue.

691
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
The 6,000 bolts of silk

692
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,330
paid by Jin'an Prefecture to the government army

693
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,890
should be considered a principal form tax.

694
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,820
It was to be paid in silk.

695
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,620
Right?

696
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,090
That's what's written in the registers.

697
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,770
And the Silk Poll Tax

698
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,410
in Renhua County

699
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,670
is a converted form tax.

700
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,600
It's paid in cash.

701
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,440
Right?

702
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,240
Yes.

703
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,940
Mr. Shuai's calculations are accurate.

704
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,160
Unfortunately,

705
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,880
he's not familiar with the processes involved in taxation,

706
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,640
and left a huge flaw in his argument.

707
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,300
He forgot to consider logistical fees.

708
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,990
Logistical fees?

709
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,000
Go on.

710
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,050
Let's take the provisions supplement

711
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,140
in the ninth year of the Chenghua reign.

712
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,610
Please think about it.

713
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,590
If Jin'an Prefecture submitted

714
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,060
6,000 bolts of silk to the army,

715
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,980
would the expenditure have been

716
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,120
only these 6,000 bolts of silk?

717
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,480
Anyone who has worked in county government knows

718
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,530
these are real goods,

719
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,790
so we still need to consider

720
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,050
the transportation fees.

721
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:06,840
That's right.

722
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,360
To transport these goods

723
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,660
to the army,

724
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,960
Jin'an Prefecture needed to prepare

725
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,220
at least 200 donkey-drawn carriages,

726
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,480
300 footmen,

727
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,330
as well as the corresponding food, feed,

728
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,460
and wages.

729
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,430
These logistical costs

730
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,400
would also have been a huge expense.

731
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,410
Yes.

732
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,550
The value of the goods needs to be added to the logistical costs

733
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,360
to derive the total expenditure.

734
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,630
This is common sense!

735
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,810
The Silk Poll Tax

736
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,780
paid by Renhua County is a converted form tax.

737
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,250
It's paid in silver.

738
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,190
3,530 taels of silver

739
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,240
weighs about 200 jin.

740
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,060
Three donkey carriages are enough, right?

741
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,160
The logistical costs involved

742
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,670
are totally different.

743
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,100
What are you claiming?

744
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,120
That because 6,000 bolts of silk is worth

745
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,760
3,530 taels of silver,

746
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,150
the same value as the

747
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,950
Silk Poll Tax,

748
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,000
the two are equivalent.

749
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,770
Pathetic!

750
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,410
You didn't know to consider the logistical costs

751
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,960
for each sum of tax.

752
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,090
When you do consider the logistical costs,

753
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,350
the expenditure involved in the provisions supplement

754
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,490
would have been far greater than 3,530 taels.

755
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,450
It doesn't tally

756
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,090
with the value of the Silk Poll Tax at all.

757
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,490
Your subsequent inferences

758
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,210
are thus baseless

759
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,140
and not worth a mention.

760
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,900
Well said.

761
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,960
He doesn't even know about logistical fees.

762
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,220
How dare he spread lies

763
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,440
in a court of law?

764
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
Atrocious!

765
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,250
Magistrate Fang.

766
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,870
Prefect Huang is new here.

767
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,720
It's fine if he doesn't know.

768
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,820
Why did you get confused too?

769
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,700
Right?

770
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,340
I was confused today.

771
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,740
Usually, I investigate things clearly.

772
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,500
It's not like that.

773
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,990
It's not like that. You're wrong!

774
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,160
Fine.

775
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,170
I'd like to hear

776
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,470
what other ideas you have.

777
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,350
Wait.

778
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,080
What are you talking about?

779
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,180
You must speak politely to your superiors.

780
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,770
You must address him as Magistrate Deng.

781
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,700
Don't be angry, Magistrate Fang.

782
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,260
If he makes sense,

783
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,360
it doesn't matter if he's rude.

784
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,210
If he doesn't make sense,

785
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,070
it's useless even if he pays obeisance.

786
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,880
In the 10th year of the Jiajing reign,

787
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,150
the court instituted the single whip law

788
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,200
in Fengxing.

789
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,760
There is one article in it that stipulates

790
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,350
all taxes are to be

791
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,910
collected and transported by the government.

792
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,330
You're right.

793
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,430
There is this article.

794
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,850
May I ask

795
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,370
what does government collection and transportation mean?

796
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,210
Before the single whip law was instituted,

797
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,260
local taxes

798
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,690
were collected and then transported to storehouses

799
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,910
by the people themselves.

800
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,250
After the 10th year,

801
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,720
the government collected the taxes and transported them.

802
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,320
That is why it's called "government collection and transportation."

803
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,460
How would the cost of transportation

804
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,890
be calculated?

805
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,280
In the past, corvée labor was used.

806
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,670
Later, His Majesty

807
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,630
felt for the difficulties of the people,

808
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,400
and replaced corvée labor with silver.

809
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,410
The people only had to pay

810
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,670
a fixed amount of money to the government.

811
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,890
Magistrate Deng is right!

812
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,780
During the 10th year of the Jiajing reign,

813
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,870
the way the government collected taxes

814
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,960
changed.

815
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,430
The way taxation was recorded

816
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,450
changed with it.

817
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,720
Before the 10th year of the Jiajing reign,

818
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,930
Fengxing's principal form taxes

819
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,740
were recorded in tax registers,

820
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,920
while logistical costs

821
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,760
were offset by the labor of the people,

822
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,240
and recorded in corvée registers.

823
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,430
In other words, the value of the principal form tax

824
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,980
and logistical costs

825
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,500
were recorded in two different registers.

826
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,430
After the 10th year,

827
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,780
with the institution of government collection and transportation,

828
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,920
payment was made in silver,

829
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,020
and no longer involved corvée labor.

830
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,450
A single register was used.

831
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,080
These are copies of the registers

832
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,180
from the 5th year of the Jiajing reign and the 1st year of the Longqing reign.

833
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,530
You can compare the differences.

834
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,730
I see.

835
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,580
Marvelous.

836
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,600
It turns out that there is a difference in bookkeeping

837
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,070
before and after

838
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,300
government collection and transportation was implemented.

839
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,540
No wonder.

840
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,550
This was

841
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,440
over 50 years ago.

842
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,040
Magistrate Mao, Magistrate Deng.

843
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,800
Back then,

844
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,930
you hadn't been born yet, right?

845
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,290
So it's inevitable for some things to fall through the cracks.

846
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,640
Inevitable.

847
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,990
Let's say you're right.

848
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,250
After the 10th year of the Jiajing reign,

849
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,970
the value of the Silk Poll Tax and the provisions supplement

850
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:25,940
still don't match up.

851
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,690
They do.

852
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,880
When I calculated the sum

853
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,930
after the 10th year of the Jiajing era,

854
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,440
the logistical fees had already been removed.

855
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,170
It's still 3,530 taels.

856
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,770
Do you need me to explain the process?

857
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,430
After all,

858
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,940
you only

859
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,370
found out

860
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,670
there is a similarity in the numbers.

861
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,450
There are countless accounts in the world.

862
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,410
Could it be that

863
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,680
whenever two sums have the same value,

864
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,190
they are the same sum?

865
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,920
How can you prove

866
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,180
the provisions supplement of the 9th year of the Chenghua reign

867
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,110
turned into the

868
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,620
Silk Poll Tax?

869
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,590
Right now, I cannot prove it

870
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,690
because the registers for the 12th to the 15th year

871
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,160
of the Chenghua reign are missing.

872
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,630
Look.

873
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,270
He's just making baseless claims.

874
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:08,990
But I have another way

875
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,830
to prove that.

876
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,520
Everyone,

877
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,670
we've checked the main registers of Jin'an Prefecture.

878
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,220
But

879
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,270
the registers for the 12th to the 15th year

880
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,900
of the Chenghua reign

881
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,040
are all gone.

882
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,940
However, there must be copies

883
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,450
in the individual registers of the eight counties.

884
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,840
Yes.

885
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,770
Yes.

886
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,750
Yes.

887
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,170
I understand what you mean.

888
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,900
You want each of the counties

889
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,500
to open their Archives

890
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,970
for you to investigate.

891
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,060
Then, it'll be clear, right?

892
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,410
Exactly.

893
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,880
Ridiculous!

894
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,180
Why?

895
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,530
Magistrate Mao,

896
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,980
this is a tax burden of over 3,000 taels of silver.

897
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,110
If we don’t find out the truth,

898
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,540
can you sleep well at night?

899
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:05,940
Prefect Huang.

900
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,040
The Archives are sensitive locations for our country.

901
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
How can we allow a mere commoner

902
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,300
to trespass into them?

903
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,860
Magistrate Deng.

904
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,830
How is this trespassing?

905
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,060
Everyone is here.

906
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,570
Won't he be going

907
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,490
in the open?

908
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,180
We only need to let him check

909
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,910
the old registers in the Archives

910
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,760
to resolve the problem

911
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,230
of the Silk Poll Tax.

912
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,360
Why shouldn't we let him?

913
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,250
We mustn't do it.

914
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,180
Prefect Huang,

915
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,980
don't be fooled

916
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,200
by this petty man.

917
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,540
If you're worried that

918
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,560
this petty man is up to something,

919
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,240
it's simple.

920
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,890
I'll preside over this personally,

921
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,700
and send my trusted subordinate

922
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,130
back with you to your county

923
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,640
for the investigation.

924
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,440
How's that?

925
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,350
Magistrate Fang,

926
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,870
what do you think?

927
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,210
I...

928
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,150
I've said this already,

929
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,760
no matter what the judgement is today,

930
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,360
I will obey your orders.

931
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,960
-I will obey your orders. -You.

932
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,219
Prefect Huang.

933
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,280
Old Mister, are you okay?

934
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,000
I have something

935
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,760
to say to Prefect Huang.

936
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,280
Slow down.

937
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,699
Old Mister.

938
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,540
Assistant Magistrate Ren.

939
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,520
What happened?

940
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,489
Assistant Magistrate Ren is old and weak.

941
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,790
He must be tired

942
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,719
after a whole day of trial.

943
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,350
Guards!

944
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,820
Help Assistant Magistrate Ren off,

945
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,530
let him rest.

946
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,580
Let's continue our discussion.

947
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,060
Old Mister Ren is reputable in Jin’an

948
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,570
and he represents Wancheng County.

949
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,290
If he’s not here for the judgement,

950
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,270
it would be unfair.

951
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,610
It would be unfair.

952
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,450
This...

953
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,330
Prefect Huang,

954
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,890
there's no rush.

955
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,240
Let Old Mister Ren rest first.

956
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,840
Let's stop here for today.

957
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,890
It's not too late if we continue tomorrow.

958
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,910
Old Mister Ren.

959
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,050
Old Mister.

960
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,320
We're here to see you.

961
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,770
You're all here.

962
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,680
Open your eyes. There are no outsiders here.

963
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,540
Old Mister Ren,

964
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,480
if not for your quick wits,

965
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,330
the situation would have become hard to deal with.

966
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,090
That's right.

967
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,650
We're in the same boat.

968
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,420
If anyone dares to retreat,

969
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,280
I'll crush him.

970
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,090
When did such a formidable man

971
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,770
appear in Jin'an Prefecture?

972
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,870
I don't care.

973
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,640
If Huang Ningdao

974
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,770
must open

975
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,200
Lanxi's Archives,

976
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,330
at worst,

977
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,060
I'll set fire to it.

978
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,520
You-

979
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,420
If you are still agonizing

980
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,020
over the details of silk tax,

981
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,040
you would be gravely mistaken.

982
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,840
Cheng Renqing?

983
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,980
What are you doing here?

984
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,910
These is a government affair,

985
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,550
not a lawsuit.

986
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,060
Why are you, a lawyer,

987
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,030
doing here?

988
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,040
Leave now.

989
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,460
Magistrate Mao.

990
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,940
Let's hear what he has to say.

991
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,600
I know your reputation.

992
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,400
The degree of justice you uphold is commensurate with

993
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,080
the amount of money you're paid.

994
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,680
Let's make it clear.

995
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,410
We don't have money for you.

996
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,730
I'm here today

997
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,580
at someone's behest

998
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,610
to bring you something.
