344
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,120
[Honourable and Just]

345
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,130
Who is he?

346
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:12,990
So arrogant.

347
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,350
Who are you?

348
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,160
I'm Cheng Renqing.

349
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,800
I am a student from Lanxi County in Jin'an Prefecture.

350
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,450
Why aren't you kneeling in court?

351
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,040
According to the Matters of the Constitution of the Hongwu Emperor's reign,

352
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,720
instructors and students are not allowed to kneel

353
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,130
when greeting their superiors.

354
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,480
I am simply

355
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,200
following the rules.

356
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,690
He's not even wearing his uniform.

357
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,600
Who is he?

358
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,600
He is

359
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,280
a famous lawyer here.

360
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,770
He has a nickname,

361
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,360
the "Honorable and Just Iron-mouth Cheng."

362
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,670
Iron-mouth Cheng, is it?

363
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,960
The victim, Lu Feilong, is illiterate.

364
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,640
I wrote the plaint that's on your table right now

365
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,520
on his behalf.

366
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,000
I hate pettifoggers

367
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
more than anything.

368
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,760
You're glib and eloquent,

369
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,240
and can stir up trouble out of nothing.

370
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,320
In my life, I only follow the principles

371
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,960
of common sense, humanity, justice, and public-mindedness.

372
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,120
I am law-abiding by nature.

373
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,000
I will not stir up trouble unreasonably.

374
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,280
Fine.

375
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,440
Let's start the trial

376
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,360
for the first case,

377
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,720
concerning debt and battery.

378
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,950
This case is clear-cut.

379
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,360
Six months ago,

380
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,170
Chen Dashan borrowed 10 taels of silver

381
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,840
from Lu Feilong.

382
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,930
According to the loan receipt,

383
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,680
it's 9 out and 13 in

384
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,080
over cycles of three months each.

385
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,370
By now, he owes

386
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,800
18 taels, 7 mace, and 2 fen.

387
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,280
16 taels and 9 mace.

388
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,600
What did you say?

389
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,080
The principal balance was 10 taels of gold.

390
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,370
If we take 9 out and 13 in, after 2 cycles,

391
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,040
the debtor should pay 16 taels and 9 mace.

392
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,960
That's how we usually do the calculations.

393
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,120
Who knows

394
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,160
what this rascal is up to.

395
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,730
You are the accused

396
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,880
in another case.

397
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,390
Don't make noise here.

398
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,300
I'm not.

399
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,120
He made a mistake.

400
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,280
If we take 9 out and 13 in for a principal balance of 10 taels,

401
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,690
the debtor should pay 13 taels after the first cycle.

402
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,920
It's a 30% profit.

403
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,260
He should pay back the 13 taels,

404
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,120
plus another 30%, in the second cycle.

405
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,160
That's 16 taels and 9 mace.

406
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,400
Do you know what “9 out” means?

407
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,040
“9 out” means

408
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,570
Chen Dashan borrows 10 taels of silver,

409
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,250
receives 9 taels,

410
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,360
and returns 13 taels per cycle.

411
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,330
That's a 44% profit.

412
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,440
After 2 cycles,

413
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,000
he should pay 18 taels, 7 mace, and 2 fen.

414
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,120
What's wrong with that?

415
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,180
You calculated it

416
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:29,960
using 9 taels as the principal balance.

417
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,610
According to the contract,

418
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,240
the principal balance should be 10 taels.

419
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,480
Magistrate Fang.

420
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,930
According to the Great Ming Code,

421
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,440
irrelevant persons are not allowed

422
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
to interfere during trials.

423
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,530
This person

424
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,960
might be talking nonsense here

425
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,290
to take revenge for a private dispute.

426
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,880
Please uphold justice.

427
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,360
That makes sense.

428
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,160
Stop talking.

429
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,180
It's not your turn yet.

430
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,860
Go away.

431
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,130
But the numbers are wrong.

432
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,600
-It'll be the same no matter who calculates it. -Go away.

433
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Stop talking.

434
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,560
Go on.

435
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,240
Chen Dashan.

436
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,840
You love your wife so much,

437
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,120
you spared no effort, and even took out a loan,

438
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,140
to pay her medical bills.

439
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,680
Right?

440
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,150
Yes.

441
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,760
Now that Lu Feilong is forcing you to pay off your debt,

442
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,720
and you can't do it,

443
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,200
he's asking you to sell your land, right?

444
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,890
Yes.

445
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,080
Then, I'm curious.

446
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,530
You clearly have land.

447
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,520
Why didn't you sell the land

448
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,370
to treat her?

449
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,610
Why did you

450
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,490
borrow money from Lu Feilong instead?

451
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,120
This...

452
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,280
Chen Dashan,

453
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,300
do you think that having borrowed money,

454
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,740
you only have to make a fuss

455
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,250
and the debt will be cancelled?

456
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,960
No.

457
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,120
How could you say that about my father?

458
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,840
Chen Xiaozhi, right?

459
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,520
I heard

460
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,190
Lu Feilong forced your father to sell you

461
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,120
to repay the debt, right?

462
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,280
Yes.

463
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,690
Lu Feilong

464
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,960
gave you two choices.

465
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,610
One was selling land to repay the debt,

466
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,320
and the other was selling his daughter to repay the debt.

467
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,240
Am I right?

468
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,330
Yes.

469
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,480
You hesitated.

470
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,680
You've been in a dilemma for a long time, right?

471
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,200
No.

472
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,400
If it were me,

473
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,370
watching my beloved daughter

474
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,280
about to get sold,

475
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,080
I would sell the land

476
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,960
without hesitation

477
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,240
to protect my family.

478
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,560
How could I hesitate?

479
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,320
You are in a dilemma

480
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,440
because deep down,

481
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,640
it's not that you cannot accept selling your daughter,

482
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,650
but that the price

483
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,320
is not reasonable.

484
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,320
It's not like that.

485
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,560
The Great Ming Code

486
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,920
prohibits

487
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,410
human trafficking.

488
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,400
I'm not forcing him to sell his daughter.

489
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,760
I just want everyone

490
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,930
to see clearly

491
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,160
how a rich landowner

492
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,560
like him

493
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,640
is hesitating between selling his land

494
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
and selling his daughter.

495
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,500
Where is his conscience?

496
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,010
His lover was sick, so he borrowed money.

497
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,520
He borrowed money, but wanted to default on the loan.

498
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,650
He couldn't default on the loan,

499
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,010
so he assaulted the creditor.

500
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,120
Is this kind of person

501
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,760
worth our sympathy?

502
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,360
He's desperate because of the loanshark!

503
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,760
Lu Feilong is not a good man!

504
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,440
I-

505
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,600
I-

506
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,920
I'll sell the land.

507
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,720
Magistrate Fang,

508
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,080
the case can be closed.

509
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,480
Then...

510
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,000

Okay.

he won't be able to live with himself

I've heard that you're a scholar of Huang-Lao philosophy.

You believe in inactive governance,

and don't like to meddle.

to help you.

but he didn't let us cash in,

536
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,850
saying that we cheated.

537
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,380
Why shouldn't we cash in

538
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,440
on the money we won

539
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,880
through lawful means?

540
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,440
Lawful means?

541
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,160
What are they?

542
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,040
Tell me.

Go ahead.

There are 32 cards in Paigow,

plus two dices.

547

The points are different on each.

548
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,010
As long as we calculate

549
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,090
the appearance of each point,

550
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,890
we can be confident of winning.

551
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,880
That means

552
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,000
you are skilled at card-counting.

Yes.

Yes.

How can you gamble

when you have so much schoolwork?

566

None of your business.

the court allocates

so much money and food

570
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,850
to subsidize

prefecture and county schools

572
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,760
in order to right the mores and dignify people's hearts,

and so that scholars can study in peace

and repay the court's imperial grace in the future.

But this playboy

576
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,460
doesn't want to study.

577
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,880
Instead, he wanders around gambling houses

578
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,290
and indulges in arithmetic.

579
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,500
Baoyu doesn't like arithmetic.

580
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,600
He only likes gambling.

581
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,960
He's really lost his way.

582

Even if he has

lost his way,

585
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,090
he has his parents to discipline him.

586
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,640
That's right.

587
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,320
Let's continue.

588
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,600
Magistrate Fang.

589
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,730
Didn't you hear it just now?

590
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,480
Shuai said

591
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,000
this method is very simple.

592
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Anyone can learn it.

593
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,080
If you judge in their favor,

594
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,540
what would happen next?

595
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,020
All the students of Renhua County School,

596
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,370
and even Jin'an Prefecture School,

597
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,640
would know of it.

598
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
As long as one masters this method,

599
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,360
even a playboy like him

600
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,840
can win so much money

601
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,920
in the gambling house.

602
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,940
Of course

603
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,170
everyone would want to learn it.

604
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,520
Who would still want to study then?

605
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,560
That's right.

606
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Yes.

607
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,320
If restrictions are not placed on gambling houses,

608
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,490
and these students

609
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,610
are allowed to gamble as they wish,

610
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,980
no one in Jin'an

611
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,840
would study hard ever again.

612
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,760
What if in future years,

613
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,200
no one passes the imperial examinations?

614
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,450
What if it affects

615
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,190
the performance evaluation of local magistrates?

616
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,490
What happens if

617
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,600
in the long term,

618
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,560
the mores of Jin'an degenerate,

619
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,240
and people only chase profit?

620
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,480
That's right.

621
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,510
I'm going to gamble too.

622
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,480
Silence! Silence!

623
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,950
So,

624
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,090
Brother Lu only refused them

625
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,960
for the sake of

626
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,880
the culture of learning in Jin'an.

627
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,400
He refused to create this opening.

628
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,950
Brother Lu

629
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,920
was truly considerate

630
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,400
and trying to nip the problem in the bud.

631
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,240
-Bravo! -Bravo!

632
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,910
Magistrate Fang, look.

633
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,240
In addition to common sense and humanity,

634
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,600
there is justice and public-mindedness.

635
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,200
Jiamo,

636
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,760
Didn't they ask you

637
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,920
to do accounting for the gambling house?

638
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,960
Sister.

639
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,160
Accounting.

640
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,880
Yes.

641
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,560
Right.

642
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,640
You helped the gambling house with accounting?

643
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,380
Lu forced us to do it.

644
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,130
Why didn't you tell me

645
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,440
they helped the gambling house with accounting?

646
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,380
I forget about it.

647
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,550
Why did you...

648
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,720
They said if I did well,

649
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,910
they would let us off.

650
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,410
How did you do?

651
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,920
In 30 days,

652
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,080
the gambling house

653
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,360
earned 1,130 taels.

654
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,010
So the gambling house is so profitable.

655
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,760
Our money in Renhua

656
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,360
has all been earned by this person from Lanxi.

657
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,160
Magistrate Fang,

658
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,330
Brother Lu just said he's willing to

659
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,370
donate 100 taels of silver to the county charity hall

660
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,840
so as to give back to the community.

661
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,510
You're a Lanxi native who opened a gambling house in Renhua

662
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,560
to earn money from the people of Renhua.

663
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,780
I suggest

664
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,120
you two not be too arrogant.

665
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,720
Otherwise,

666
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,040
I

667
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,960
can't go against the people's will either.

668
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,130
Of course.

669
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,350
We are willing to give in.

670
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,260
What is this lawyer

671
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,200
saying to the Magistrate?

672
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,120
All right.

673
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,920
My verdict is as follows.

674
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,040
Feng Baoyu

675
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,280
and Shuai Jiamo

676
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,030
won money

677
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,520
through cheating and unlawful means.

678
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,840
The gambling house is not to let them cash in.

679
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,450
However, Shuai Jiamo

680
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,430
helped perform accounting for the gambling house.
