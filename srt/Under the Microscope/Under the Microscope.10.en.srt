How long has it been since Yun Niang passed away?

Seven years.

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,220
Since ancient times, beautiful women are like generals.

They don't let this world witness them age and grow old.

That is why she chose me.

You are a lawyer.

96

Putting aside the fact that I am a prosecutor,

even the normal citizens,

100
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,580
cannot be accusing others of their innocence without evidence.

102

for the corresponding amount of justice that you serve,

105
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,350
you still have the nerve to say something like that?

106

Others may be scheming.

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,940
But if Yun Niang knew that the man she married

108

read Buddhist scriptures?

after people die,

some will be reincarnated into humans,

In my opinion,

when we are alive as humans,

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,020
it is the same.

I have to admit that

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,300
you were indeed much more talented

141

than I was back then.

142

You looked better too.

143
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,660
It is understandable why Yun Niang chose you.

144
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,540
But since that incident during the examination,

145
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,380
our encounters have became very different.

146
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,340
It is almost as different as reincarnation.

147

I was reincarnated as a human,

148

but you became a beast.

149
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,500
Since you have become a beast,

150
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,909
you have to live as a beast.

Lanxi County's white books of tax and labor.

174
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,740
It doesn't matter.

175
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,700
Labor has always been measured

176
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,790
in the unit of a mile.

177
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,180
110 households per mile.

178
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,360
Knowing this

179
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,900
is enough for me.

180
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,500
That's good.

181
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,820
Shuai Jiamo,

182
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,900
please begin.

183
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,870
The Silk Poll Tax

184
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,440
was originally established in the ninth year of the Chenghua reign,

185
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,500
to be supplemented by the Jin'an Prefecture.

186
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,550
The supplement of 6,000 horses

187
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,460
was to be shared equally across 8 provinces.

188
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,100
In the 16th year of the Chenghua reign,

189
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,820
it was changed to the Silk Poll Tax,

190
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,150
and it became the sole responsibility of Renhua County.

191
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,790
To prove the connection between these two cases,

192
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,870
is simple.

193
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,830
As long as we find the tax accounts of the other seven counties

194
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,740
other than Renhua,

195
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,140
during the Chenghua reign,

196
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,990
and investigate any instances of increase or decrease,

197
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,220
the results will be obvious.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,350
Everyone knows all of this.

199
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,980
However, the ledgers were all burned.

200
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,960
Yet you insist on

201
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,070
taking these records

202
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,270
and add to the chaos?

203
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,580
During the Jiajing reign 10 years ago,

204
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,950
the summer tax of Fengxing

205
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,100
required the mobilization of labor

206
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,580
and have the people transport the goods themselves.

207
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,620
In other words,

208
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,990
we can also see the amount of taxes

209
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,300
through these white books of tax and labor.

210
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,860
Shuai Jiamo,

211
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,180
let me remind you.

212
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,830
Not everyone here

213
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,470
is good at arithmetic

214
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,140
just as you are.

215
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,420
I think you need to

216
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,860
to explain in detail

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,260
in case some people don't understand,

218
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,380
and come complaining again.

219
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,900
Okay, let me give you an example.

220
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,020
For example, we don't know the amount of summer grains

221
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,420
that Renhua County needs to supplement.

222
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,590
But through these records,

223
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,380
we can find out that

224
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,620
Magistrate Fang mobilized

225
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,230
1,000 civilians for transportation this year.

226
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,860
As we know,

227
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,750
two civilians can transport five dan of grain.

228
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,300
The summer grains that Renhua County has to supplement

229
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,660
is therefore 2,500 dan in total.

230
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,780
In this way,

231
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,470
it is a lot easier to explain and understand.

232
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,020
Prefect Huang,

233
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,670
the point here is not the method,

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,180
but

235
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,740
what is this person's motive.

236
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,700
Cheng Renqing,

237
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,300
you are just a small lawyer.

238
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,300
Who allowed you to speak here?

239
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,180
Leave.

240
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,180
Does anyone else have any objections?

241
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,820
All is good if no one has any objections.

242
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,060
Shuai Jiamo, start your calculations.

243
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,630
[On the 11th year of the Chenghua reign, in one of the actual record books]

244
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,280
[1,500 pieces of silk]

[The 16th year of Chenghua, Lanxi County]

247
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,380
[Wancheng]

248
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,460
It has been solved.

249
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,870
Just tell me the result.

250
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,030
In the ninth year of the Chenghua reign,

251
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,740
the Jin'an Prefecture had to supplement 6,000 bolts of silk,

252
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,220
and 3,530 taels of silver,

253
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,460
which was shared equally across the eight counties.

254
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,110
But since the 12th year of the Chenghua reign,

255
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,510
the proportion that each county is responsible for

256
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,380
has been changing.

257
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,740
What do you mean?

258
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,380
This is a very delicate

259
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,110
accounting operation.

260
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,340
If all taxes and duties

261
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,540
were suddenly transferred to Renhua County,

262
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,940
then the alarm will be raised immediately.

263
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,740
The method they used

264
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,980
was to progressively increase the proportion of tax

265
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,870
of Renhua County.

266
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,900
In other words,

267
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,540
Renhua County would pay more every year,

268
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,670
while the rest of the seven counties would pay less.

269
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,790
This was done quietly, not showing a single trace.

270
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,860
After four years,

271
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,380
Renhua County has an extra

272
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,950
3,530 taels of tax to pay for no reason at all.

273
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,100
The subject matter has also been then changed to the Silk Poll Tax.

274
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,380
Got it.

275
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,060
All right, thank you, Shuai Jiamo.

276
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,340
Go take a rest.

277
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,950
This method is really clever.

278
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,740
It's really boiling frogs in warm water.

279
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,340
No wonder.

280
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,300
Renhua paid

281
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,380
these extra taxes for no reason,

282
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,440
and yet remained completely unaware.

283
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,750
It turns out the proportion of our share

284
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,060
has been raised slowly over the past four years.

285
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,320
You see, the people

286
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,340
only knows that the Imperial Court has been raising taxes.

287
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,970
The...

288
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,260
The Imperial Court increasing the tax

289
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,780
is of course perfectly justified.

290
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,210
Fine.

291
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,060
Since the Silk Poll Tax

292
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,990
was a result of being tampered with,

293
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,710
then we should get to the bottom of this matter

294
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,560
and return fairness.

295
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,530
Inspector Liu, I think

296
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,950
we shouldn't rush into this.

297
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:19,790
After all,

298
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,260
this is an issue from more than 100 years ago.

299
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,370
Times have changed.

300
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,690
Besides, the eight counties of Jin'an now

301
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,950
and the eight counties of Jin'an then,

302
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,780
are two very different situations.

303
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,960
The number of households has increased.

304
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,100
And the number of cultivated lands

305
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,640
has changed a lot.

306
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,620
It would be unfair

307
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,850
if we split it equally just like how it should have been in the past.

308
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,070
Prefect Huang,

309
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,350
this is a simple problem.

310
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,590
I have a plan.

311
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,440
How about we re-measure the fields

312
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,910
in the eight counties of Jin'an Prefecture?

313
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,740
We will decide on the proportion

314
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,830
according to the new statistics.

315
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,260
Great.

316
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,780
Inspector Liu is so thoughtful.

317
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,760
This is a great proposal.

318
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,720
Well,

319
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,360
I will announce it now.

320
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,080
Wait.

321
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,350
Cheng Renqing,

322
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,990
what do you still want to do?

323
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,750
Prefect Huang.

324
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,970
Inspector Liu.

325
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,260
Magistrate Mao.

326
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,210
Do you know why

327
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,510
Shuai Jiamo is bringing up

328
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,620
this century-old story?

329
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,880
You just want to repeat the fact that

330
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,430
Shuai Jiamo's father

331
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,400
was wronged because of this,

332
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,970
and Shuai Jiamo is just extracting his personal revenge?

333
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,180
How many more times do you want to

334
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,360
repeat this completely unrelated accusation?

335
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,540
But there really was such a case.

336
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,310
Back then, Shuai Duncheng

337
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,650
was punished exactly

338
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,320
for this crime.

339
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,170
He set himself on fire in fear of being arrested.

340
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:39,760
Assistant Prefect Song.

341
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,150
So what?

342
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,200
These ledgers are real.

343
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,790
But...

344
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,590
All of you

345
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,810
are officials of the county.

346
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,830
You should know the key to such matters

347
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,970
is not in its fairness, but what it demonstrates.

348
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,900
If Shuai Jiamo

349
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,740
causes the whole Jin'an Prefecture

350
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,290
to not live in peace

351
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,380
because of his parents' grudges,

352
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,220
and he does not receives

353
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,100
any punishment,

354
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,410
what kind of role model

355
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,580
are we setting?

356
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,670
Once the precedent is made,

357
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,820
and if other people follow suit,

358
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,160
would the county offices

359
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,010
still have the energy to do anything else?

360
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,480
Nonsense!

361
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,070
Today, Renhua can claim that

362
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,420
the Silk Poll Tax is unfair

363
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,680
and ask for a thorough investigation.

364
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,900
Then tomorrow Lanxi can also say

365
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,200
that the tax is unbalanced and ask for it to be checked again.

366
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,080
And how about

367
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,590
Tongyang, Wujiang, Wancheng?

368
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,350
Try asking which county's tax

369
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,400
in Jin'an Prefecture

370
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,410
is completely fair?

371
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,880
If everyone demands correction,

372
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,010
where will we have the energy

373
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,020
to do other things?

374
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,280
Everyone,

375
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,330
are you really willing to

376
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,840
forgo Jin'an Prefecture's peace and stability at all cost,

377
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,480
and dig up this old account

378
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,780
from over a hundred years ago,

379
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,800
just for this arithmetic nut's selfishness?

380
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,910
Cheng Renqing.

381
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,100
Are you

382
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,410
threatening Prefect Huang?

383
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,000
I dare not.

384
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,850
I just want to remind everyone

385
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,530
to be reasonable and righteous.

386
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,420
In which, common sense comes first.

387
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,600
The public interest's

388
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,620
only ranks fourth.

389
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,940
Cheng Renqing,

390
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,760
you are always smooth talking here.

391
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,520
Come!

392
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,280
Get him out of here!

393
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,200
Wait, Prefect Huang.

394
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,490
I have something in mind that

395
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,110
I don't know if I should say it or not.

396
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,200
Commander Ma,

397
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,990
this is a civil affair.

398
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,250
You can just sit and listen.

399
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,890
Must we all voice our

400
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,610
opinion on this?

401
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,870
Civil affairs?

402
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,520
I don't think so.

403
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,040
I heard from Shuai Jiamo that

404
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,520
the origin of this Poll Silk Tax is due to

405
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,420
the provisions of supplements to prepare against the Japanese, right?

406
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,100
Yes.

407
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,150
The Jinqu Armed Forces

408
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,420
was established in the 45th year of Jiajing.

409
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,720
Our scope of work

410
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,320
also includes preparing ourselves against the Japanese.

411
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,750
Jin'an, Bizhou and other places

412
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,340
are still providing these supplements.

413
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,560
Since the Silk Poll Tax

414
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,200
arose from the need to provide these supplements,

415
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,960
then the Army should

416
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,440
naturally be allowed to voice our opinion.

417
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,170
Military affairs interfering with civil affairs,

418
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,310
is a big taboo of the Imperial Court.

419
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,120
Aren't you afraid of being impeached

420
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,720
by doing so?

421
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,900
Inspector Liu,

422
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,339
you call me Commander Ma,

423
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,599
but do you know

424
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,609
what comes in front?

425
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,920
Fengxing District Attorney's Office.

426
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,560
That's right.

427
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,660
Although I am in charge of the Jinqu Armed Forces,

428
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,260
but I am still the Chief Prosecutor.

429
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,650
So, it is also within my duty

430
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,579
to investigate and ban corruption.

431
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,720
You are also an inspector.

432
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,710
Don't you understand that?

433
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:27,589
Well...

434
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,190
Fine.

435
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,580
But,

436
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,220
I have something to say.

437
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,490
Feel free to say it.

438
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,130
Whether it will be accepted or not,

439
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,820
it is up to Prefect Huang.

440
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,620
After listening to the trial for so long,

441
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,560
I suddenly remembered something.

442
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,250
In the end of the Qin dynasty,

443
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,810
there was a great rise in the number of heroes.

444
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,410
The most powerful one

445
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,890
is the King of Xichu, Xiang Yu.

446
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,280
The most insignificant

447
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
is the bumpkin Liu Bang.

448
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,520
Xiang Yu burned all bridges in the Battle of Julu

449
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,660
and defeated Qin's General Zhang Han.

450
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,960
Liu Bang instead

451
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,600
took this opportunity

452
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,730
to attack Guanzhong

453
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,370
and occupied Xianyang.

454
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,350
Liu Bang is a bumpkin,

455
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,200
and so are all is men,

456
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,300
who are just hooligans from Pei County.

457
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,030
They have never seen

458
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,710
a city that is as splendid as Xianyang.

459
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,390
So they enjoyed

460
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,740
wealth and prosperity to its fullest.

461
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,790
Only one of them

462
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,810
is an exception.

463
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,550
This person is Xiao He.

464
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,280
Xiao He didn't go to rob the gold, silver and jewelry,

465
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,040
or the satin and silk.

466
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,720
The first thing he did in Xianyang

467
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,490
was to go to the archives in Xianyang

468
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,170
and collected all the documents on taxes,

469
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,600
and household registration.

470
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,240
These documents contain

471
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,790
information on 13 different aspects

472
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,770
across the 36 counties of Qin.

473
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,910
Strong men, livestock,

474
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,920
fields and storage.

475
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,600
After the Hongmen banquet,

476
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,700
Liu Bang was forced to go to Hanzhong.

477
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,010
He did not take with him

478
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,970
any valuable items,

479
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,650
but only brought with him these documents.

480
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,540
It is only thanks to these documents

481
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,480
that Liu Bang knew the reality of the world.

482
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,700
He knew the amount of civilians,

483
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,380
which enabled him to make plan strategically

484
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,770
during the battle of Chu Han,

485
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,240
and win the battle.

486
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,630
They had a bigger vision to rule the world,

487
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,750
and therefore Emperor Gaozu of Han gave Xiao He the biggest credit.

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,710
Commander Ma,

489
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,060
we are not sitting here

490
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,210
to listen to your storytelling.

491
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,430
What I want to say is

492
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,250
if a politician wants to achieve anything,

493
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,940
he must first master the numbers.

494
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,390
Given that the Imperial Court wants to refresh its politics,

495
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,360
if Jin'an can reset the taxes,

496
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,160
clear and measure the fields,

497
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,420
this is actually the perfect timing,

498
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,550
which is also aligned with the general public's opinion.

499
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,320
To worry about the interests of the nation first and foremost,

500
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,260
our Army will

501
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,990
definitely support you.

502
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,700
Are you done, Commander Ma?

503
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,080
Yes.

504
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,220
If either both of you

505
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,480
ever requires the help of our Army,

506
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,240
just let me know.

507
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,370
I will be more than happy to help.

508
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,200
Even so,

509
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,790
when we report it to the Imperial Court,

510
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,430
given your current capcity,

511
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,530
we cannot put your name down as a co-signatory.

512
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,540
As long as it's good for the Imperial Court,

513
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,300
and the locals,

514
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,180
why would I

515
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,360
grab onto this credit?

516
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,530
However,

517
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,020
let me make this clear.

518
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,200
If the both of you

519
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,250
does anything

520
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,670
that is not beneficial for the country,

521
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,310
I would not hesitate

522
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,570
to impeach any of you.

523
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,430
Well,

524
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,200
do the both of you

525
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,210
still have any thoughts?

526
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,620
It's my duty

527
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,040
to be of service to the people.

528
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,030
Magistrate Mao,

529
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:02,960
what about you?

530
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,110
Since everyone agrees,

531
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,290
Lanxi County

532
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,560
will also agree.

533
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,720
Very well. I hereby announce

534
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,890
three days later,

535
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,240
the eight counties of Jin'an

536
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,380
are to measure their fields again,

537
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,520
in preparation of the restoration

538
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,240
of the old Silk Poll Tax policy.

539
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,420
All county governors and households

540
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,930
are to make arrangements well in advance.

541
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,450
Prefect Huang,

542
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,800
what should we do with this lawyer?

543
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,350
What do you think, Commander Ma?

544
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,990
This person has been

545
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,300
sowing discord from the beginning.

546
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,390
Whatever it means to be righteous

547
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,140
and reasonable.

548
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,150
It is just an excuse

549
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,030
for you to make money.

550
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,880
Everyone heard it just now.

551
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,020
Shuai Jiaomo has proven

552
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,410
the injustice of the Silk Poll Tax.

553
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,790
He even dug up people's secrets for his personal gain

554
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,760
and attacked Shuai Jiamo's past.

555
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,570
He even threatened the stability

556
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,830
of Jin'an Prefectural Office.

557
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,630
I am afraid the ethos of Jin'an Prefectural Office

558
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,730
is ruined by this kind of people.

559
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,080
Commander Ma is right.

560
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,810
I also think there is something wrong with him.

561
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,580
Magistrate Mao.

562
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,140
Is Cheng Renqing

563
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,160
your legal advisor?

564
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,930
Of course not.

565
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,280
He is just a lawyer

566
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,250
with tricks up his sleeves.

567
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,660
I see.

568
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,670
I hereby announce that

569
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,480
Cheng Renqing is guilty of

570
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,000
spreading false rumors to deceive the public and provoke lawsuits.

571
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,970
Take him out and cane him ten times.

572
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,230
He will be expelled from the county academy,

573
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,250
and detained back to Lanxi to reflect on himself.

574
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,210
From now on,

575
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,640
he will not be allowed to enter the county or prefecture offices

576
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,530
as a lawyer.

577
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,310
You and Master Fan

578
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,910
had already discussed earlier this afternoon,

579
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,020
but you still want me to object.

580
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,010
It has been awhile since

581
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,280
I have seen you make an impassioned speech

582
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,630
just like you did back in the academy.

583
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,160
I really missed it.

584
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,050
To be honest,

585
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,730
during that examination,

586
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,200
my father's plan

587
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,500
was just for me to

588
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,590
to take your top spot away.

589
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,570
I was the one who got someone to put a note

590
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,450
into your bag,

591
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,840
and have it found by the invigilator on purpose.

592
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,220
In this way,

593
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,910
you won't even have a chance

594
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,830
to start over.

595
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,660
If you trample on someone you hate,

596
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,900
you have to trample on them entirely.

597
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,080
If Yun Niang knew

598
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,430
the man she chose

599
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,480
is such a good-for-nothing,

600
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,590
she probably won't be able to rest in peace, right?

601
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,690
Hit him two more times.

602
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,060
Hurry up.

603
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,120
Cheng Yuan.

604
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,550
Slow down.

605
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,200
The bumpy ride hurts after the caning.

606
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,500
Mr. Cheng.

607
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,560
The old Mr. Li of the Lanxi Archives

608
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,560
is dead.

609
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,960
Dead?

610
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,810
I just got the news that

611
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,810
that Mr. Li committed suicide

612
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,740
by hanging himself in the prison.

613
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,710
He even left a suicide note.

614
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,690
He said that the fire in the archives

615
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,450
was actually set off by him by accident.

616
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,670
He was afraid of taking the responsibility,

617
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,550
that's why he pushed it to

618
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,310
Shuai and Feng.

619
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,030
That sounds more reasonable.

620
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,590
This arson case

621
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,770
is finally closed.

622
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,820
There are no more pitfalls.

623
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,260
As to whether he really committed suicide,

624
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,070
no one cares.

625
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,590
What do you think?

626
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:07,940
No.

627
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,520
What's wrong?

[Grand Master's Office]

Master Fan,

631
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,300
I have let you down.

632
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,810
I'm ashamed.

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,620
Lawyer Cheng,

634
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,180
you have a mistress in Renhua County

635
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,610
named Feng Biyu, right?

636
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,300
Miss Feng and I

637
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,440
are clean and honest.

638
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,650
Please don't

639
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,700
to ruin her reputation.

640
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,510
I heard that a few days ago,

641
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,690
you came to Renhua County

642
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,580
and went to find Feng Biyu.

643
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,130
If there's no personal relationship,

644
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,260
why are you looking for her?

645
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,580
Feng's shop is well-known far and wide.

646
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,970
Why can't I go?

647
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,030
But that night,

648
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,460
Feng Biyu went to find Fang Maozhen.

649
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,720
Later,

650
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,860
Fang Maozhen suddenly

651
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,830
took the tickets to the Jin'an Prefectural Office for no reason.

652
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,050
That's why

653
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,060
there was so much trouble afterwards.

654
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,240
The most important fact

655
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,420
is that you

656
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,430
saved Shun and Feng

657
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,080
in the Lanxi Archives fire.

658
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,510

There's a fire!

660
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,730
Put out the fire!

661
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,130
Fire!

662
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,010
Sir.

663
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,680
Someone is here.

You are a smart man.

667
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,970
A common shortcoming among smart people

668
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,320
is that

669
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,840
they always think they are the smartest.

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,460
having you here these few days

681
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,720
to apply this ointment for me,

682
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,910
I am feeling much better now.

683
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,290
This ointment belongs to Biyu.

684
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,300
This technique

685
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,020
is the same technique she uses to cure the ham.

686
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,230
It is very useful.

687
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,700
I see, so this is Miss Feng's ointment.

688
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,680
Shuai Jiamo.

689
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,120
I said you wanted to avenge your parents.

690
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,290
You still won't admit it?

691
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,110
Such a big three thousand five hundred and thirty

692
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:02,630
[3530]

693
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,420
painted right there on the wall.

694
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,800
There is just a mistake in the Silk Poll Tax.

695
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,020
No hatred.

696
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,620
I treated you so terribly

697
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,510
in court the last time.

698
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,030
Why did you save me?

699
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,760
Because a lot of what you said

700
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,650
is wrong.

701
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,200
I want to make it clear to you.

702
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,380
Dummy.

703
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,950
What a dummy.

704
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,930
To be honest,

705
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,110
I always thought

706
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,460
everyone in this world

707
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,650
will abide by the principle of being reasonable and righteous.

708
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,200
being reasonable and righteous.

709
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,350
But only on you,

710
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,840
this principle does not work.

711
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,790
I don't understand.

712
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,380
Trying to talk to you is useless.

713
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,310
We are

714
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,790
are not at the same level at all.

715
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,770
But now,

716
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,740
you are the only one

717
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,130
who is willing to talk to a loser like me.

718
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,490
Be gentle.

719
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,790
What happened tonight?

720
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,930
What a big scene.

721
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,950
My father once taught me

722
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,830
a technique to measure the fields.

723
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,700
It is called the Art of Gathering Projected Steps.

724
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,710
He taught me the formula when I was young.

725
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,230
Unfortunately, I can't remember.

726
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,050
My father was a military officer.

727
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,780
I was taught

728
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,880
to work hard and be the best.

729
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,400
To hone my will,

730
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,710
I have been practicing martial arts since I was young.

731
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,700
Because of my father's strictness,

732
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,050
I was full of enthusiasm,

733
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,650
and determined to enter the academy.

734
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,050
His voice would reverberate within the academy,

735
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,810
"To learn from past lessons,

736
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,570
to bring peace to the world,

737
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,210
to help save the world,

738
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,100
and sweep out the ills of our time."

739
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,170
The key

740
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,690
to the Art of Gathering Projected Steps,

741
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,350
lies in the intersection of latitude and longitude,

742
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,230
and marking the original.

743
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,350
It was also at that time

744
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,780
when I got to know

745
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,380
the academy principal's daughter, Yue Niang.

746
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,320
We loved each other.

747
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,600
First pull out the latitudes and longitudes, then measure the original.

748
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,550
After marrying Yun Niang,

749
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,410
my life with her

750
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,460
was poor,

751
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,450
but those times

752
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,550
were so beautiful.

753
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,250
Yun Niang spent all her savings

754
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,900
to buy me a horse,

755
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,240
so that I could get around more conveniently.

756
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,710
She named it

757
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,420
Cloud.

758
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,940
I was going to

759
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,620
to participate in the examination in the second year,

760
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,130
get first place,

761
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,400
and let Yun Niang live a good life.

762
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,000
However,

763
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,440
Ma Wencai sabotaged me.

764
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,430
Measure the topography first,

765
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,820
then estimate the number of steps.

766
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,990
Fortunately, I have Yun Niang by my side.

767
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,960
She would not leave me.

768
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,030
But one could not predict the future.

769
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,970
Yun Niang suddenly got seriously ill,

770
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,710
and we had spent all our savings.

771
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,170
One day,

772
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,610
my classmate asked me to write a complaint for him.

773
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,880
I really didn't have any more money to buy medicine for Yun Niang.

774
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,190
So I reluctantly agreed.

775
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,800
The reward was really generous.

776
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,920
But God is merciless.

777
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,980
Yun Niang's illness...

778
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,830
was too much to recover from.

779
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,430
She still couldn't make it.

780
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,110
No, she didn't.

781
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,610
As white clouds float in the sky,

782
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:24,410
it has no roots underneath or anything else by its sides.

783
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:32,680
Time does not tell when it turns into rain,

784
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:47,840
it is most pitiful because it has no control over its heart.

785
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,820
This Hongchuan River

786
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,130
can yield at least

787
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,930
a few hundred acres of fertile land

788
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,900
if we just irrigate it slightly.

789
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,160
Exactly.

790
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,010
I just wonder how much money it will cost.

791
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,610
Yes.

792
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,950
If we apportion it out,

793
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,889
the people will be burdened again.

794
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,639
Chief Bookkeeper Ren!

795
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:20,560
Chief Bookkeeper Ren!

796
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,020
Get down.

797
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,199
It's me.

798
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,330
Let him come here.

799
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,370
Chief Bookkeeper Ren,

800
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,590
I finally found you.

801
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,719
I am busy with work.

802
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,449
If there is anything, let's talk back at the county office.

803
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:32,989
No.

804
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:33,710
Please tell me

805
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,710
all about the Complete Works of the Silk Event.

806
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,120
Go back to work.

807
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:38,909
Yes.

808
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,840
Regarding this Silk Poll Tax case,

809
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,409
I am your enemy and not your friend.

810
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,250
I have my position to take.

811
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,440
If you really want to help him,

812
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,330
persuade him to forget about this immediately.

813
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,219
Chief Bookkeeper Ren,

814
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,600
what did you tell me

815
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,780
was the important thing in life?

816
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,330
Fame and fortune

817
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,640
are just worldly possessions.

818
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,310
Being happy

819
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,480
is the most important thing.

820
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,080
But if a person

821
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,710
forgets even their parents,

822
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,130
tell me,

823
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,390
how can he live happily?

824
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,830
Chief Bookkeeper Ren, you may not know,

825
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,510
but the reason Shuai keeps solving problems

826
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,640
and calculating every day,

827
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,240
is simply because he is trying to recall

828
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,410
his parents.

829
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:18,980
Did he really say that?

830
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,210
He never told me this.

831
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,060
But I can see that

832
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,790
he must really miss them,

833
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,680
after losing his parents at seven.

834
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,150
He misses them very much.

835
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,160
If they had left something behind,

836
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,930
he could still have a memento for memory's sake.

837
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,400
But that fire

838
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
destroyed everything in its path.

839
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,080
How could he recall?

840
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,480
He can only recall

841
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,120
some memories

842
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,170
by calculating non-stop.

843
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,760
That's true.

844
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,700
So you knew.

845
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,190
I just heard.

846
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,260
Feng Baoyu,

847
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,160
you are really doing your best

848
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,930
for Shuai Jiamo.

849
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,700
Because Shuai is a good brother that

850
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,500
I can rely on.

851
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,410
Emergency report from Jin'an Prefectural Office!

852
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:27,900
Emergency report from Jin'an Prefectural Office.

853
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,770
[With immediate effect, the eight counties under the jurisdiction of Jin'an are to remeasure and reformulate all cultivated land.]

854
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,260
I knew it.

855
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,570
Good plan.

856
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,050
This time,

857
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,150
the whole of Jin'an

858
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,700
will be in chaos.

859
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,750
[Counties to be aware of what is on the right]

860
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,070
Jin'an Prefectural Office officially orders that

861
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,330
in consideration of

862
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,890
the repeated disputes over the Silk Poll Tax,

863
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,070
in order to tally fairly,

864
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,160
from today onwards,

865
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,710
the eight counties under Jin'an's jurisdiction,

866
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,140
are to remeasure all cultivated land,

867
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,280
and reformulate the number of land.

868
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,590
All the county officials, civil servants, civilians,

869
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,830
must be prudent in their actions and be careful when calculating.

870
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,750
This shall not be delayed.

871
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,220
One would be wrong to think that

872
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,940
one can complete this task perfunctorily within a single move.

873
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,580
What does this mean?

874
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,670
What does it mean?
