00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,640
by luckily opened the door.

177
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,210
That's strange.

178
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,620
Since you escaped,

179
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,330
why didn't you report it to the government immediately?

180
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,460
Instead, you fled overnight

181
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,690
and went to Tongyang County.

182
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,810
The masked kidnapped us.

183
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,450
It's contradictory.

184
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,540
The masked men

185
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,530
wanted to burn you to death.

186
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,700
And you said the masked men

187
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,049
kidnapped you.

188
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,200
I don't understand.

189
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,450
Whether the masked men

190
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,400
wanted to kill you

191
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,490
or they were practising running?

192
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,240
Gosh.

193
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,170
What a joke.

194
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,410
Why did the masked men

195
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,130
did this?

196
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,250
I don't know.

197
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,080
But what I said is true.

198
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,120
Let me ask you.

199
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,040
Who is this masked man?

200
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,160
It's Lu Feilong.

201
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,090
Who is it?

202
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,210
Governor,

203
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,330
Lu Feilong is the head of the police

204
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,840
in our county.

205
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,530
He is in charge of arresting criminals

206
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,040
and maintain the security.

207
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,940
You mean Lu Feilong

208
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,250
the police

209
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,290
kidnapped you two?

210
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:12,850
Yes.

211
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,690
And he burnt the archives,

212
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,610
and took you two

213
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,920
all the way to

214
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,130
Tongyang County and let you go?

215
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,600
Yes.

216
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,210
No.

217
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,400
He didn't mean to let us go.

218
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,210
Lu Feilong wanted to

219
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,130
kill me and Shuai

220
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,450
in the temple of Tongyang.

221
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,970
We escaped.

222
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,930
This is outrageous.

223
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,730
Why didn't he do it in Lanxi?

224
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,910
Instead he sent you to

225
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,130
Tongyang County and kill you?

226
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,680
Feng Baoyu,

227
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,440
you are a educated man.

228
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,050
Next time when you make up a story,

229
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,090
try to be convincing.

230
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,520
I...

231
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,210
Feng Baoyu.

232
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,170
Think carefully.

233
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,010
Feng Baoyu,

234
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,170
in your testimony,

235
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,920
you said

236
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,130
the masked man wanted to burn you to death.

237
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,800
And then you said

238
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,970
the masked man took you away.

239
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,940
Then you said

240
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,890
the masked man wanted to kill you

241
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,200
in Tongyang.

242
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,970
It's contradictory.

243
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,320
Which part should I believe in you?

244
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,930
Besides,

245
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,010
Lu Feilong

246
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,330
is the head of the Police Department of Lanxi County.

247
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,090
Why did he burn the archives

248
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,650
in his county?

249
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,450
What's his motive?

250
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,170
Yes.

251
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,930
What's his motive?

252
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,890
May I ask

253
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,960
the witness, Lu Feilong to come here?

254
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,520
Summon Lu Feilong.

255
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,850
I am Lu Fei Long, the head of the police of Lanxi County.

256
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,930
Greetings, Magistrate Huang.

257
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,250
Stand up and answer.

258
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,930
Thank you, Magistrate Huang.

259
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,410
Lu Fei Long,

260
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,440
where were you on the day of the incident?

261
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,000
I was having a drink at the restaurant.

262
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,120
It can be testified by the people in the restaurant.

263
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,160
OK.

264
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,370
I did see him that day

265
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,920
and said hello to him.

266
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,850
Mr.Liu.

267
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,530
Magistrate Huang.

268
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,060
Magistrate Mao.

269
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,000
The truth is clear.

270
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,220
Lu Fei Long

271
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,380
is quite famous

272
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,450
in Jin'an's territory.

273
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,050
In terms of threatening and kidnapping,

274
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,080
he must be capable.

275
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,560
But

276
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,650
he has no motive or time.

277
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,850
So what Feng Baoyu said

278
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,400
were all made up.

279
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,960
No.

280
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,890
Lu Feilong had time.

281
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,450
When Shuai and I fell off the cliff

282
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,450
and hid in a farmer's house,

283
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,010
he even went after us.

284
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,810
Someone in Tongyang County

285
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,840
must have seen Lu Feilong.

286
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,360
You're so funny.

287
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,210
Lu Feilong is the head of the police.

288
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,530
His duty is to arrest the criminals.

289
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,380
You can escape to Tongyang County.

290
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,970
Why can't he go to Tongyang County?

291
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,330
Magistrate Deng from Tongyang

292
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:40,970
can testify.

293
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,250
As soon as Lu Feilong entered the country,

294
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,760
he reported it to the county government.

295
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,770
Lu Feilong had no motive to

296
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,490
burn the archives.

297
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,410
Shuai and I didn't either.

298
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,730
Still won't give up?

299
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,640
I have no choice.

300
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,820
I can only invite another person

301
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,040
to the court.

302
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,280
Approved.

303
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,250
Be careful.

304
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,810
Be smart.

305
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,690
Your daughter and grandson

306
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,640
are still at home.

307
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,920
I am the official of Lanxi archives.

308
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,400
Greetings, officers.

309
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,250
Stand up and answer.

310
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,890
Thank you.

311
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,800
Here, sir.

312
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,400
In front of the officials,

313
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,930
tell us what you saw

314
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,480
and heard

315
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,960
that day.

316
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,050
I'm ordered to guard the archives.

317
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,120
Since the investigation,

318
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,050
they have always opened the door in the morning.

319
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,410
They checked the storage and

320
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,880
left at sunset.

321
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,130
I will lock the door then.

322
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,170
When it was time to close the door that day,

323
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,610
I told them

324
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,370
to leave.

325
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,560
But Shuai jiamo didn't leave.

326
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,400
He said he was waiting for someone.

327
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,410
Not long after,

328
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,560
a gentleman came.

329
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,160
Is this gentleman in the hall?

330
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,640
It's Feng Baoyu.

331
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,730
Nonsense!

332
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,520
You never saw me

333
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,690
at the archives.

334
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,290
Mr. Feng closed the door

335
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,760
after entering the archives

336
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,080
and didn't let me get close.

337
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,360
I thought they had things to do,

338
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,770
so I left for dinner.

339
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,530
Why did they

340
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,730
break the order

341
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,210
to stay in the house at night?

342
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,050
I don't know.

343
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,120
I only heard noises.

344
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,250
I can't hear clearly because my hearing is not good.

345
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,210
I can only heard something they were arguing.

346
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,610
I only heard that

347
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,050
they didn't have time to check the fish-scale map register.

348
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,970
And they didn't know what to do.

349
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,720
They also said something like don't implicate into this.

350
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,730
They seemed to complain to each other.

351
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,770
Then, I saw a candle lit inside,

352
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,080
so I reminded them.

353
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,730
But they kicked me out.

354
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,400
He's lying.

355
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,960
Who is lying?

356
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,010
He is lying.

357
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,810
I have never argued with Baoyu.

358
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,090
I didn't delay

359
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,000
the progress of the investigation.

360
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,250
He said

361
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,600
when Baoyu and I were arguing,

362
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,890
I mentioned the fish-scale map register,

363
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,010
and said we had no time for it.

364
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,570
That's impossible.

365
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,380
My job

366
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,680
is to investigate tax accounts.

367
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,960
The fish-scale map register records

368
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,970
the land situation.

369
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,690
It's not the same

370
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,930
as what I supposed to check.

371
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,850
I would never say that.

372
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,730
He might have heard it wrong.

373
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,810
He said it just now. His ears...

374
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,560
No.

375
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,880
Someone else is looking for the fish-scale map register.

376
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,720
Who is it?

377
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,850
Inspector Liu sent

378
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,920
to help me.

379
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:38,930
Actually,

380
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,520
they didn't help me at all.

381
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,650
Once he entered the archives,

382
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,170
he went straight to the fish-scale map register.

383
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,490
He probably wanted to know

384
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,920
the land in Lanxi County.

385
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,690
This has nothing to do with the case.

386
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,610
No.

387
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,800
It's related.

388
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,370
This old man

389
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,690
must have seen those two bookwriters

390
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,770
looking for the fish-scale map register,

391
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,580
so he thought that Shuai and I

392
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,920
were looking for it.

393
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,850
What's funny is

394
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,130
you have no idea

395
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,770
what they were checking is totally different

396
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,120
from what Shuai was checking.

397
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,000
Inspector Liu,

398
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,530
please call back those two bookwriters.

399
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,330
They spent every day

400
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,330
with Shuai.

401
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,480
Ask them

402
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,170
and you'll know whether Shuai

403
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,410
have touched the book.

404
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,800
Inspector Liu,

405
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,730
how about calling back

406
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,690
the two bookwriters

407
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,810
and let them come up and talk.

408
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:33,880
Alright.

409
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,690
I heard from the government

410
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,780
that Fang Shixiang

411
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,410
didn't even get a main seat.

412
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,500
He just standed by,

413
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,100
and didn't even get the main seat.

414
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,810
Guys,

415
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,130
do you think Fang Shixiang

416
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,370
deserve to be an official?

417
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,090
Does he deserve it?

418
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,760
No.

419
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,970
Let me ask you two.

420
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,570
Have you seen Shuai Jiamo touched

421
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,960
any documents

422
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,490
other than taxes?

423
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,610
No.

424
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,680
Are you sure?

425
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,400
I've never seen

426
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,080
such a determined person.

427
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,760
He stopped moving as soon as he sat down.

428
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,130
Until sunset,

429
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,560
he kept reading

430
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
and counting.

431
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,810
Do you mean

432
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,230
Shuai Jiamo

433
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,970
calculates the taxes all the time

434
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,360
and he never touched

435
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,010
the fish-scale map register?

436
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:21,760
Governor,

437
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,250
what he's investigating

438
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,920
has nothing to do with that book.

439
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,290
I see.

440
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,960
The official of Lanxi County's archives.

441
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,770
Tell me,

442
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,860
how did you hear

443
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,800
Shuai Jiamo fight with others?

444
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,560
He must be senile.

445
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,730
Cheng Renqing,

446
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,850
everything he said

447
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,970
doesn't count., right?

448
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,320
It doesn't count.

449
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,570
Do you hear me? It doesn't count.

450
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,090
Note it down.

451
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,680
It doesn't count.

452
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,850
How dare you

453
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,010
made up lies for no reason

454
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,400
and tricked us officials?

455
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,680
How despicable!

456
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,240
Guards!

457
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,640
Take him away and flog him ten times.

458
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,650
Please!

459
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,410
Please spare my life!

460
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,730
Please!

461
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,609
Who ordered you to

462
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,760
lie here?

463
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,560
Tell me.

464
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,210
Say it.

465
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,250
Magistrate Huang,

466
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,810
he lies can only prove

467
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,650
that Shuai Jiamo and Feng Baoyu

468
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,560
didn't quarrel.

469
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,890
But it can't prove

470
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,859
the fire in the archives

471
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,849
has nothing to do with them.

472
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,760
It can't explain why

473
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,290
they fled after the accident

474
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,440
and went to Tongyang County.

475
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,280
Cheng Renqing,

476
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,970
stop fooling around.

477
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,930
His testimony is fake.

478
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,210
Then Shuai Jiamo

479
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,810
has no motive

480
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,650
to burn the archives.

481
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,490
Maybe he accidentally moved the candle.

482
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,440
Cheng Renqing,

483
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,050
how dare you say something ridiculous

484
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,400
in front of me?

485
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,040
Guard!

486
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,170
Drag him away.

487
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,760
Flog him ten times!

488
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,370
Please forgive me!

489
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,600
Please!

490
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,650
Feng Baoyu, Shuai Jiamo.

491
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,890
After investigation,

492
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,520
there is no evidence of the burning archives.

493
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,570
I declare that you are innocent.

494
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,010
How could this happen?

495
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,340
What should we do this time?

496
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,810
Well...

497
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,330
If we are innocent...

498
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,240
Hurry up.

499
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,640
Magistrate Huang!

500
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,370
Magistrate Huang.

501
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,010
Since the old guy was lying,

502
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:25,690
it can prove

503
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,330
what we just said

504
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,250
is true.

505
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,280
The one who kidnapped us

506
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,880
is Lu Fei Long.

507
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,010
Lu Feilong?

508
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,640
He got someone testified for him.

509
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,520
The time doesn't match.

510
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,720
As for who ordered him to lie

511
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,850
and set fire to the archives,

512
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,890
we'll investigate it later.

513
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,040
Shuai Jiamo,

514
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,890
I want to ask you,

515
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,610
have you completed the task

516
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,130
that Mr. Liu give to you?

517
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,530
The source of the Silk Poll Tax.

518
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,600
Did you find out?

519
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,370
Yes.

520
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,480
Magistrate Huang.

521
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,290
The trial today

522
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,130
is about the fire case.

523
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,500
Since you have decided

524
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,730
they are innocent,

525
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,000
they should be dispersed.

526
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,160
Why are you talking about

527
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,090
the Silk Tax case?

528
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,170
Magistrate Mao,

529
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,850
regarding the Silk Tax case,

530
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,130
some people in Jin'an

531
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,520
are putting some obstacles here.

532
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,460
That's the reason

533
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,650
of the fire case.

534
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,080
They seems irrelevant,

535
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,560
but actually related.

536
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,810
If we clarify

537
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,200
the truth of the Silk Tax case.

538
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,960
Everything will be solved.

539
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,600
We should call

540
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,690
the other magistrate

541
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,610
if you want to purpose this.

542
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,360
They should be present.

543
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,370
I, the Inspector of Jin'an,

544
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,890
set up a prosecutor for this case.

545
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,330
Can't I investigate the case

546
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,160
without others?

547
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,170
Shuai Jiamo,

548
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,660
have you found any evidence?

549
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,080
Evidence?

550
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,360
They were all burned.

551
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,770
The archives in Lanxi County

552
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,380
is the most well-preserved

553
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,170
and the oldest one.

554
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,650
Now that it's burnt out,

555
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,280
the other counties

556
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
are hard to find the evidence.

557
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,570
But I've figured out

558
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,280
another way that

559
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,650
can also prove

560
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,250
the origin of the Silk Poll Tax.

561
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,640
Tell me now.

562
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,610
We just need to find out

563
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,490
the White Book of taxes and corvée of Renhua and Lanxi.

564
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,090
The White Book of taxes and corvée?

565
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,080
Your Excellency,

566
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,650
may I have a word with you?

567
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,170
Magistrate Mao.

568
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,930
What is this for?

569
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,730
Please have a seat.

570
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,850
The White Book of taxes and corvée

571
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,120
is not appropriate to demonstrate

572
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,650
in public.

573
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,290
Why?

574
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,050
You know that the Yellow Book of taxes and corvée

575
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,400
is to show to the court.

576
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,090
But the facts of a county

577
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,810
are all written

578
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,570
on the White Book of taxes and corvée.

579
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,970
And all the affairs of a county are written on it,

580
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,130
these are the lifeblood of a county.

581
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,500
But why can't we

582
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,810
show it to the public?

583
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,370
This is very useful,

584
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,090
but it is

585
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,250
against the court's law.

586
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,290
Counties

587
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,080
won't show it to the court,

588
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,250
and the court will

589
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,850
turn a blind eye to it.

590
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,080
Everyone knows how it works.

591
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,080
If we let Shuai Jiamo

592
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,220
show the White Book to the public,

593
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,110
it's hard for us to do it again

594
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,050
in the future, Magistrate Huang.

595
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,640
In that case,

596

597

692
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,650
You've come a long way.

693
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,250
Why don't you rest in the back hall first?

694
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,360
We'll talk about it later.

695
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,000
No need.

696
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,600
I'll sit next to Magistrate Huang.

697
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,680
It's been years.

698
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,570
Brother Cheng.

699
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,840
How have you been?

700
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,810
Have a seat.

701
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,080
Let's continue.

702
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,530
Shuai Jiamo.

703
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,010
Where were we?

704
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,380
We need to check

705
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,360
The White Book of taxes and corvée of Renhua and Lanxi.

706
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,090
Yes.

707
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,450
What do you think?

708
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,280
I've sent someone

709
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,090
to retrieve the White Book of taxes and corvée .

710
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,610
Magistrate Mao, what about you?

711
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,720
I'll send someone to fetch it.

712
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,640
But it takes one day

713
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,130
to travel back and forth.

714
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,810
Magistrate Mao, no need.

715
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,650
When I was in Lanxi,

716
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,330
I had someone write a copy.

717
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,520
It's in the Censorate.

718
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,210
Just send someone to get it.

719
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,370
Why didn't I know?

720
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,640
-How dare you...
-Magistrate Mao.

721
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,090
It's my duty

722
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,210
to record those documents.

723
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,730
Magistrate Mao,

724
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,480
you have something hidden

725
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,440
and dare not to show us?

726
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,570
How about this?

727
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,000
Officer Ma,

728
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,410
you must be tired

729
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,040
after such a long way.

730
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,890
Everyone and I

731
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,930
have been discussing this

732
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,000
for the whole morning.

733
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,850
Next,

734
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,120
we'll have to wait for the White Book to come.

735
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,890
I announce we

736
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,890
rest for the time being.

737
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,200
We'll discuss this in the afternoon.

738
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,280
Magistrate Fang is out.

739
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,560
Magistrate Fang!

740
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,080
Magistrate Fang!

741
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,800
You are finally here for us.

742
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,810
Magistrate Fang.

743
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,210
Our Great Lord.

744
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,980
Be careful.

745
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,370
-Magistrate Fang.
-Magistrate Fang!

746
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,850
Magistrate Fang.

747
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,340
You are really our Great Lord..

748
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,300
You are the Great Lord.

749
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,210
-Thank you.
-Magistrate Fang.

750
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:48,930
You really help the people.

751
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,730
You are a good official.

752
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,250
Magistrate Fang.

753
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,920
Hey.

754
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,480
What's going on?

755
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,920
Didn't you hear that?

756
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,640
The people are cheering for you.

757
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,440
They say you are the Great Lord.

758
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,050
The Great Lord?

759
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,610
Thanks a lot.

760
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,010
When did I become

761
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,300
the Great Lord

762
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,360
You are!

763
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,730
You are the Great Lord.

764
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,200
Yes.

765
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,210
Magistrate Fang!

766
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,160
Magistrate Fang.

767
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,040
Alright.

768
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,240
Magistrate Fang.

769
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,940
Magistrate Fang is here.

770
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,860
Magistrate Fang.

771
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,980
You are really a good official who upholds justice for the people.

772
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,020
Lord Fang.

773
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,880
Magistrate Fang.

774
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,650
The Great Lord.

775
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,770
The Great Lord.

776
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,210
From now on,

777
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,650
you are Lord Fang.

778
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,540
Go get the White Book

779
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,720
as soon as possible.

780
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,690
OK.

781
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,130
Master,

782
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,360
what you did in the court today...

783
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,140
Mr. Mao and Master Fan

784
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,610
won't be happy.

785
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,700
I have already told the things

786
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,600
and done the things.

787
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,280
I don't care.

788
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,320
Well,

789
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,040
what about the Eight County Alliance?

790
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,180
I'm the magistrate of Renhua,

791
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,300
of course I have to speak

792
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,170
from Renhua's point of view

793
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,960
and speak for the people.

794
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,210
Magistrate Fang.

795
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,680
You're against us, aren't you?

796
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,330
You're clearly going against us.

797
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,410
Magistrate Mao.

798
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,810
Why are you so loud?

799
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,410
I...

800
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,680
Have you thought it through?

801
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,930
Am I going against you

802
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,920
or Master Fan?

803
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,050
Is there any difference?

804
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,440
That's a big difference.

805
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,010
If I go against you,

806
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,210
we are discussing the official business.

807
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,040
If I go against Master Fan,

808
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,170
that's nothing.

809
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,600
As I think,

810
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,450
your career is about to end.

811
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,280
If it ends, then I quit.

812
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,930
That's better than being a dog behind others.

813
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:45,370
You...

814
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,330
Magistrate Mao,

815
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,540
we are

816
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,400
appointed by the imperial court.

817
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,180
We can't

818
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,660
always do as what others say

819
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,290
and follow them

820
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,850
like dogs.

821
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,660
We don't have

822
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,010
the dignity of being an official.

823
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,090
Magistrate Fang, are you talking

824
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,640
about being an official?

825
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,770
Okay.

826
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,240
Today,

827
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,520
I'll tell you about how to be an official.

828
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,360
I'm better than you.

829
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,880
You've been doing nothing these years.

830
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,240
Don't tell me that

831
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,530
less is more.

832
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,720
Yes.

833
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,220
I admit that I made a lot of mistakes

834
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,840
in Lanxi.

835
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,690
I fawned on Master Fan.

836
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,810
But with him as my backup,

837
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,490
I built three bridges

838
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,400
and five barns.

839
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,540
Even the roads from Lanxi

840
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,560
to Jin'an

841
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,930
was built by me.

842
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,850
Yes, in these aspects,

843
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,930
I'm not as good as you.

844
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,090
All of you

845
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,680
are children of the officials.

846
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,530
You are all from noble families.

847
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,600
Even the worst is from a scholar family.

848
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,080
You can be noble.

849
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,160
Unlike you,

850
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,890
I'm from a poor family.

851
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,170
There's no man in my family.

852
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,130
My mother worked so hard

853
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,450
to support me to reach the position of magistrate.

854
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,570
I have no backer in the court.

855
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,640
I don't know anyone in Lanxi.

856
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,660
I don't rely on Master Fan.

857
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,490
What can I rely on?

858
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,170
I can use my fists.

859
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,320
Magistrate Mao.

860
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,690
Water can carry a boat and overturn it.

861
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,880
Don't you

862
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,170
understand this?

863
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,890
Of course I know.

864
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,850
Magistrate Fang, if you quit being an official,

865
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,970
you can teturn to the countryside.

866
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,120
You can still be a rich person in the village,

867
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,130
playing rocks

868
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,080
and riding horses in your free time.

869
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,880
What about me?

870
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,650
If I resign,

871
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,680
my mother and I

872
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,570
will have nothing.

873
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,810
If I want to be successful,

874
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,090
I have to work.

875
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,050
If I want to do something, I have to rely on someone's power.

876
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,080
But how can I pay it back

877
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,930
if I owe someone?

878
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,250
Conscientiousness

879
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,000
is all I have.

880
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,610
Alright.

881
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,650
Magistrate Mao,

882
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,610
I've heard what you said.

883
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,930
Good.

884
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,640
Brother Fang,

885
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,650
what I just told you

886
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,690
is trying to

887
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,410
make the point that

888
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,170
I can't afford to lose.

889
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,080
In this case,

890
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,130
I'll risk my life

891
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,690
to fight for a fair result.

892
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,250
Fang,

893
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,770
you usually play with rocks

894
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,010
instead of knives.

895
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,260
Don't you know

896
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,199
the weight of Guanwang sword?

897
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,210
You have to use all your strength

898
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,280
to lift it up.

899
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,170
Like people used to say,

900
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,290
if you cut it,

901
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,320
you won't be able to regret it.

902
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,960
Whether it's right or wrong,

903
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,610
there's no way back.

904
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,210
Kill!

905
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,480
See you in the afternoon.

906
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,170
Ma Wencai

907
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,770
must be invited by Fan Yuan.

908
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,850
He's up to no good.

909
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,170
Master Fan

910
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,050
has quite a lot of connections.

911
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,040
Ma is a prosecutor.

912
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,690
But Fan can still ask him to come.

913
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,420
Don't underestimate

914
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,960
these noblemen.

915
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,170
They are not easy to deal with.

916
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,120
Fan Yuan

917
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,570
used to be an official.

918
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,520
He's familiar with many

919
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,000
relatives in-law,

920
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,250
old friends, and officials.

921
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,680
They are enough to weave a big net.

922
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,850
If you stab him,

923
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,720
the whole net will cover you.

924
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,570
Ma Wencai will definitely question this Silk Tax case

925
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,480
in the afternoon.

926
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,080
We need to figure it out.

927
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,090
Now that the Shuai has been acquitted,

928
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,610
Magistrate Fang has openly turned to us.

929
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,530
The Eight County Alliance

930
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,880
has broken.

931
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,720
In the afternoon,

932

if I say this case is wrong,

933
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,690
you should immediately talk about

934
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,780
the thing of

935
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,290
measuring the fields again.

936
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:52,860
If you say it,

937
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,040
our task is done.

938
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,050
Jiamo,

939
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,720
look,

940
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,800
the Feng family sent someone to deliver food.

941
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,850
How can they only deliver meat but no vegetables?

942
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,130
Here.

943

Where is your friend?

946
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,610
Why isn't he back yet?

947
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,290
Where did he go?

948
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,050
I don't know.

949
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,490
He is just

950
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,250
a playboy for fame.

951
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,930
Jiamo,

952
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,560
it's very lucky for you to be annouced innocent.

953
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,840
It's a narrow escape.

954
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,290
Listen to me, in the future,

955
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,740
do not

956
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,290
get involved in this again.

959

We have chicken soup today.

961
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,330
eating chicken head can cure nut.

962
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,400
Shuai Jiamo

963
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,600
is not a nut at all.

964

If anyone is not convinced,

965
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,490
let him compete with Shuai about counting.

and the other is also a arthmetic nut.

Is this not nut enough?

969

When brother Song

970
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,210
sent this chicken here today,

971
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,260
he said he asked someone to find

972
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,250
an excellent doctor

973
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,770
specializes in treating nuts.

974
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,010
The medical fee is very expensive.

975
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,530
It's okay.

you sent me chicken.

00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,050
nine acres is enough.

1036
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,450
That's too much difference.

1037
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,250
How much do you want?

1038
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,730
I'm not talking about money.

1039
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,080
I mean the area of the fields.

1040
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,250
Think about it.

1041
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,370
If you really write it down,

1042
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,760
it's too different

1043
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,200
from the number in the fish-scale map register.

1044
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,050
As long as someone compare it,

1045
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,700
he will know

1046
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,380
what the problem is.

1047
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,130
Duncheng,

1048
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,770
use your rope

1049
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,600
to shrink the edges

1050
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,610
and keep the shape.

1051
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,240
This is

1052
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,210
prohibited by the law.

1053
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,800
The land is ten acres,

1054
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,570
you're going to change it to nine acres.

1055
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,040
You have to pay taxes in the future.

1056
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,380
You will pay much less.

1057
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,650
Duncheng,

1058
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,290
you are the most accurate man

1059
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,560
to measure lands in the government.

1060
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,800
Who would doubt you?

1061
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,480
Even the magistrate

1062
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,860
wouldn't come here

1063
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,040
to check it.

1064
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,920
To be honest,

1065
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,130
this place

1066
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,760
belongs to the Fan family.

1067
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,530
The money

1068
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,210
was also given by them.

1069
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,650
Fan family?

1070
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,260
I've measured four land

1071
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,170
for the Fan family.

1072
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,850
The land I measure this month

1073
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,970
are all their land.

1074
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,010
How much land did they buy?

1075
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,890
Who can count it clearly?

1076
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,610
Both parties are even.

1077
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,920
They give us the money,

1078
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,160
and we are happy.

1079
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,800
Why not help them?

1080
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,120
Hurry up. Put it away.

1081
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:58,960
-What are you doing?
-No.

1082
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,780
-Duncheng.
-Listen to me.

1083
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,600
I can't accept the money.

1084
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,920
If the magistrate finds out…

1085
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,400
What's the matter with you?

1086
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,520
In this generation of the Fan family,

1087
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,840
there are two provincial graduates and one metropolitan graduate.

1088
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,120
There are still officials in the court.

1089
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,490
The magistrate wants

1090
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,810
to fawn on him.

1091
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,170
He won't provoke them.

1092
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,320
Abundant harvest.

1093
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,810
Abundant harvest.

1094
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,000
Abundant harvest.

1095
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,360
Abundant harvest.

1096
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,720
Abundant harvest.

1097
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,720
Abundant harvest.

1098
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,410
Abundant harvest.

1099
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,680
Abundant harvest.

1100
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,360
Jiamo.

1101
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,840
Jiamo, are you stupid?

1102
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,250
Why didn't you hide?

1103
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,160
Duncheng,

1104
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,920
how can you give him a good future

1105
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,800
with this amount of salary?

1106
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,650
How much does it cost

1107
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,360
to cure his illness?
