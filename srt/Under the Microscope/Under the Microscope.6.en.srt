97
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,680

When we were discussing previously,

100
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,420

101
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,410
go to the other counties' Archives

102
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,410
to go through their documents.

103
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,810
But we were stopped.

104
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,450
Actually this is easily solvable.

105
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,130
As long as Prefect Huang

106
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,450
goes over to the other counties to have a look,

107
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,730
we'll have the full picture.

108
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,850
If I ask them to open the Archives,

109
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,410
they have no right to stop us.

110
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,410
So when are we going to

111
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,210
view the documents?

112
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,730

117
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,920
Both of you don't know

118

how dedicated Prefect Huang is.

119
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,250
He was afraid that I wouldn't take this case,

120
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,490
so he specially attached this bulletin

121
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,920
under the memorandum.

122
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,680
I thought this bulletin

123
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,530
accidentally got stuck under it.

124
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,130
Not only did you fools

125
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,850
not understand it,

126
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,010

127

to write such a lousy indictment.

129
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,760
You nearly

130
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,090
made all of Prefect Huang's efforts

131
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,320
go to waste.

132
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,640
Read it carefully.

133
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,520
If you can figure it out,

134
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,370
everything will be clear.

135

If you can't,

136
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,600
whatever I say will be useless anyway.

137

Let's go.

140
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,480

141

If this case is won,

142
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,700
it won't bring any benefit

143
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,370

144
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,890
But if the case is lost,

both of your reputations will be ruined.

146

Seeing as the two of you are working so hard

147

on a thankless task like this,

148
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,610
there must be another reason behind it.

149
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,490
This has nothing to do with me.

150
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,570
I'm just going along

151
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,720

152
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,810
What about you?

153
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,690
If the numbers are wrong,

154
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,210
they should be corrected.

155
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,320
Is there anything wrong with that?

156
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,210
Shuai,

157
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,500
I still don't get

158
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,290
the secret that lies

159
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,320
behind this bulletin.

160
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,850
What's wrong with it?

161
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,170
Once Inspector Liu looked at the bulletin,

162
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:56,810
he understood everything.

163
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,370
It's almost like a riddle.

164
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,400
Is that important?

165
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,890
Sometimes I really envy

166
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,170
how naive you are.

167
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,610
Think about it.

168
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,320
Earlier Inspector Liu asked you

169
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,740
why you are doing such a

170
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,120
thankless task like this.

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,410
Cheng Renqing also asked you this.

173
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,040
Prefect Huang and the other county magistrates

174
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,330
also asked you.

175
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,850
But my answer stays the same.

176
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,650
What matters is not your answer,

177
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,410
but that everyone thinks

178
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,170
you must stand to gain other benefits

179
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,960
from instigating this issue.

180
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,090
But I don't.

181
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,720
That doesn't mean that other people don't.

182
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,130
Think about it.

183
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,010
Revolving around this silk tax case,

184
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,490
I think everyone

185
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,040
has his own motive.

186
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,720
Brother.

187
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,409
These two are so crafty.

188
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,930
They are actually following an official's palanquin.

189
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,440
How are we supposed to make our move?

190
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,010
Usually no civilians are allowed

191
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,320
to follow along with an official's palanquin.

192
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,010
Who is sitting in the palanquin?

193
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,370
It's not an official of Yanzhou.

194
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,850
I think he was called the...

195
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,850
Regional Inspector.

196
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,480
The Regional Inspector?

197
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,170
This is the way to Jin'an, right?

198
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,770
Yes.

199
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,560
This is bad.

200
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,810
Keep following them.

201
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,160
I'll make a move first.

202
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,850
Inspector,

203
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,650
here is the map.

204
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,680
Which part of Jin'an are we at now?

205
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,130
Lanxi County.

206
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,370
It's only slightly over 20 li to the county town.

207
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,320
Lanxi.

208
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,490
Jiande.

209
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,049
I understand.

210
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,330
We won't

211
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,570
stop here today.

212
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,730
Let's move faster later

213
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,240
and rest once we reach Lanxi County.

214
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,510
Lanxi is good.

215
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,730
It's comfortable staying in Lanxi.

216
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,120
Furthermore, I think it only takes a day

217
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,730
to go back to Renhua from Lanxi.

218
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,690
We're not going to Renhua for the time being.

219
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,040
Where are we going then?

220
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,850
We will set up the Regional Inspection Bureau

221
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,840
in Lanxi County,

222
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,920
and conduct the trial on the spot.

223
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,490
Then we should probably tell Prefect Huang

224
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,880
and Magistrate Mao about this in advance.

225
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,440
If we inform them in advance,

226
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,640
and they link up in advance,

227
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,280
what effect would there be?

228
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,240
Finish your water,

229
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,280
and we'll set off immediately.

230
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,850
I'm Lu Feilong!

231
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,600
Open the gates!

232
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,390
[Renhua]

233
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,320
It's Master Lu.

234
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,250
According to the rules,

235
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,610
we can’t open the city gates at night.

236
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,410
I need to see Master Fan urgently.

237
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,490
We really can't open the gates.

238
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,010
Let me pull you up by rope.

239
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,920
Hurry.

240
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,970
Hurry up.

241
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,330
Okay.

242
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,410
Slow down.

243
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,530
Slow down, slow down, slow down!

244
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,200
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

245
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,180
[Lanxi]

246
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,680
How great.

247
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,120
Great.

248
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,810
Absolutely great.

249
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,290
Magistrate Mao really understands

250
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,320
the essence of swordsmanship.

251
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,530
Out of the hundreds of county governors in Ming,

252
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,770
in terms of governance,

253
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,490
I may not be one of the best.

254
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,080
But in terms of fighting skills,

255
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,000
I can be considered

256
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,240
one of the top few.

257
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,210
Magistrate Mao.

258
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,320
Magistrate Mao.

259
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,760
Something happened.

260
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,730
Something happened.

261
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,170
How dare you!

262
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,250
Who are you?

263
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,890
How dare you occupy the county office and cause trouble?

264
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,000
Magistrate Mao.

265
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,250
With this outfit of yours,

266
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,930
I thought you were going to join the army.

267
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,170
That's none of your business.

268
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,450
Who are you?

269
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,770
I am the Regional Inspector of Fengxing,

270
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,450
Liu Jing.

271
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,090
The Regional Inspector?

272
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,650
Impossible.

273
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,970
I didn't receive any official document saying that

274
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,250
the Inspector was coming to our county.

275
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,370
The document has already been sent to Renhua County.

276
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,730
I decided impromptu

277
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,610
to set up an investigation bureau in Lanxi.

278
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,520
If you don't believe me,

279
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,810
I have the official seal, the imperial edict,

280
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,650
and documents from the Censorate.

281
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,240
Go ahead and verify it if you want.

282
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,490
Fine.

283
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,210
[Notice from the Censorate Granting Travel for Inspection]

284
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,010
It really is true.

285
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,600
Inspector Liu.

286
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,570
You're so sneaky.

287
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,970
How could you just spring a surprise visit

288
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,280
without telling me?

289
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,930
How is that befitting of an inspector?

290
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,690
Magistrate Mao.

291
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,250
You don't look like a magistrate either,

292
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,040
dressing like you're ready for a fight.

293
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,890
This is what I wear for my morning exercise.

294
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,930
I didn't know you were coming.

295
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,930
I'll go back and change first,

296
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,600
before coming back to discuss matters with you.

297
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,280
I'll wait for you.

298
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,970
Magistrate Mao.

299
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:56,810
Magistrate Mao.

300
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,000
Magistrate Mao.

301
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,400
Just say whatever you have to say.

302
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,090
Can't you see I'm busy?

303
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,570
Someone saw Shuai Jiamo.

304
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,890
He came together with Inspector Liu.

305
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,930
What?

306
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,330
When did they get on the same side?

307
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,530
I...

308
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,050
I don't know.

309
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,080
Go.

310
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,250
Go to Zhuge Village immediately

311
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,770
and find Cheng Renqing

312
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,010
for me.

313
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,450
Understood.

314
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,090
Go.

315
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,490
Inspector Liu.

316
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,520
I am under the Emperor's orders

317
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,090
to inspect the eleven prefectures of Fengxing.

318
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,210
I plan to set up a Regional Inspection Bureau

319
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,650
in Lanxi County in order to

320
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,490
go through the records and oversee lawsuits.

321
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,050
Since it's His Majesty's order,

322
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,330
I offer my full cooperation.

323
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,410
Very well.

324
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,000
Magistrate Mao, please rise.

325
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,770
I currently have

326
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,570
a case on my hands.

327
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,170
Is it the silk poll tax case

328
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,050
filed by Shuai Jiamo?

329
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,560
Magistrate Mao, not only are you skilled in martial arts,

330
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,440
you can even tell the future!

331
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,250
This matter will impact

332
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,050
national tax revenue,

333
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,610
and is no small matter.

334
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,450
You...

335
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,040
should think carefully.

336
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,690
These two thieves...!

337
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,400
Shuai Jiamo claims that

338
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,360
the silk poll tax

339
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,040
amounting to 3,530 taels,

340
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,650
was due to the reallocation of funds

341
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,450
to supplement provisions a hundred years ago.

342
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,170
This should have been equally shared between the eight counties,

343
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,010
but after the 16th year of the Chenghua reign,

344
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,000
this tax burden fell only on Renhua County.

345
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,520
Shuai Jiamo.

346
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,280
You said there is evidence to back this up?

347
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,970
Yes.

348
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,490
We just need to check

349
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,690
the Archives of Lanxi County,

350
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,090
and look at the tax records

351
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,130
from the 11th year of the Chenghua reign

352
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:02,890
to the 16th year of the Chenghua reign.

353
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,840
The truth will be revealed then.

354
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,570
Who are you to decide? What's your name?

355
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,290
I'm Shuai.

356
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:06,720
You...

357
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,680
I'm the one investigating the case now.

358
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,610
I need to open the Archives.

359
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,520
On what basis?

360
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,840
On what basis?

361
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,920
On the basis of the order of the Imperial Court.

362
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,640
I am under orders to inspect Fengxing.

363
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,610
My most important duty

364
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,370
is to go through records.

365
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,370
I have to go through

366
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,770
every single document and file

367
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,320
across the eleven prefectures of Fengxing.

368
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,770
Why should Lanxi County

369
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,450
be exempted from that?

370
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,570
Magistrate Mao,

371
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,480
you've been trying to push this off repeatedly.

372
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,160
Is there really something you're trying to hide?

373
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,040
If you try to stop us again,

374
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,130
I will file a complaint against you!

375
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:59,080
[Archives]

376
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,570
This way please.

377
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,210
I'll stay here to keep watch,

378
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,370
let's see who dares to get in the way of our work.

379
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,250
These two scribes here

380
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,200
are my trusted aides that work for me regularly,

381
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,240
I'll let them help you too.

382
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,600
How long do you think you will need?

383
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,600
Within three days.

384
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,890
Why are you here?

385
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:00,930
I'm from Lanxi County,

386
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,170
why can't I come?

387
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,850
Why are you so unfriendly?

388
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,410
If I didn't

389
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,040
advise you previously,

390
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,760
Shuai Jiamo would

391
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,370
probably be sent

392
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,450
to somewhere far far away.

393
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,160
Thank you

394
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,560
for your advice previously.

395
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,520
Since you're in Lanxi,

396
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,840
why don't I do my part as a host,

397
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,610
and find you

398
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,610
somewhere comfortable to sit?

399
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,930
I'm watching the cat here.

400
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,770
Just leave.

401
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,410
From this gate here,

402
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,330
head out,

403
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,690
walk a hundred steps to the east,

404
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,000
and you'll see a place called Lanfang Pavilion.

405
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,210
The wine and music there

406
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,970
are exceptionally good.

407
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,210
Especially their cherry yoghurt iced drink,

408
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,760
it cools you down and quenches your thirst.

409
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,480
Outside of Lanxi,

410
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,800
you won't find a place

411
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,170
where you can have that anymore.

412
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,560
Young Master Feng.

413
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,980
Since Shuai Jiamo won't be

414
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,360
done with his matters anytime soon,

415
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,690
you have to wait anyway,

416
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,120
so why don't you go to Lanfang Pavilion to wait?

417
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,160
After eating,

418
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,170
have some drinks and enjoy some music.

419
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,770
I have two lovely ladies there,

420
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,650
and they're really good at...

421
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,329
I'm not going.

422
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,000
With all your sweet-talking,

423
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,970
who knows what you're up to?

424
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,089
It's a pity you won't get to witness my two ladies'

425
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,369
skills at playing cards.

426
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,290
Forget it. I won't force you.

427
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,170
I'm leaving.

428
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,329
Cheng Renqing.

429
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,850
Young Master Feng, show your cards.

430
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,610
-Let me. 
 -Let me help you with it.

431
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,090
Let me.

432
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,090
Let me do this one.

433
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,680
You lost.

434
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,090
Young Master Feng is so lucky.

435
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,040
Young Master Feng,

436
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,490
why don't you stay in Lanxi for a few more days?

437
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,970
There are a few more good places

438
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,730
that are worth a visit.

439
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,200
How long I stay here

440
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,330
will depend on how fast Shuai

441
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,680
does the calculations in the accounts.

442
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,060
-What are you afraid of?
-Cheers, Young Master Feng.

443
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,290
Let him investigate it himself.

444
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,810
We'll enjoy ourselves.

445
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,970
Shuai Jiamo

446
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,530
is not a calculating person.

447
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,170
He won't be jealous of you.

448
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,200
Of course Shuai isn't the calculating type.

449
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,840
But Inspector Liu on the other hand...

450
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,450
Forget it.

451
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,770
I won't get in the way of Shuai's matters.

452
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,930
Inspector Liu looks like the type that is

453
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,810
upright and righteous,

454
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,490
and he's efficient at what he does.

455
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,120
He should be a pretty capable official.

456
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,160
He is definitely efficient

457
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,720
at getting things done.

458
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,200
But I'm not so sure about him being

459
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,210
upright and righteous.

460
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,200
He must have his motives

461
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,880
for taking on this case.

462
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,330
How can you tell?

463
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,440
This case of ours

464
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,980
was previously rejected

465
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,930
when we were at Yanzhou Prefecture.

466
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,930
Later on,

467
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,970
we submitted another memorandum.

468
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,450
When Inspector Liu

469
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,970
saw the bulletin stuck on the back

470
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:36,920
of the new memorandum,

471
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,040
his attitude completely changed.

472
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,240
Bulletin?

473
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,290
Without this bulletin,

474
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,930
he would never have taken this case.

475
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,970
I've been flipping that bulletin around

476
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,330
multiple times to try and

477
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,050
figure it out,

478
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,880
but I still don't understand what's special about it.

479
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,560
What is a bulletin?

480
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,600
You don't know much, do you?

481
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,520
Let me show you.

482
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,490
This is a bulletin.

483

This bulletin

484
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,290
talks all about national affairs.

485
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,370
What happened in each province

every month,

487
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,560
it's all written in...

Cheng Renqing.

490
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:08,890
Give it to me.

491
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,770
Give it to me.

492
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,760
Give it to me.

493
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,160
You always play tricks on me.

494
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,250
Look at you.

495

[Bulletin - 4th month of the 7th year of Wanli's reign]

496
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,130
You couldn't snatch over the bulletin,

497
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,650
neither could you read the contents,

498
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,800
what use are you?

499
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,120
Magistrate Mao, why are you getting so worked up?

500
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,330
Although I didn't see the content,

501
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,930
but I immediately made sure

502
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,250
I caught the date and page number

503
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,440
written in the corner of the bulletin.

504
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,280
It was from the morning of the 4th month of this year.

505
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,720
Master Fan worked in the central government for a long time.

506
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,480
Is there anything hidden in this bulletin?

507
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,320
Let me see.

508
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,490
Mindi doing a remeasurement of the land.

509
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,490
This is what's happening in Mindi.

510
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,080
What does it have to do with us?

511
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,800
Keep reading.

512
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,960
Okay.

513
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,740
Let me see.

514
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,370
Magistrate Mao.

515
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,290
[Mindi calculating farm tax for the first time]

516
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,160
Undisclosed farmlands?

517
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,360
It says here that

518
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,210
the rich families in Mindi have constantly been

519
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,280
changing their farm fields to undisclosed farmlands

520
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,250
which they don't have to pay tax for.

521
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,640
In counties where this is the most serious,

522
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,580
one county can have

523
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,440
60% of land being undisclosed farmland,

524
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
with only 40% of the land being taxed.

525
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,680
Obviously, the imperial court is trying to

526
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,610
use this Remeasurement Policy in order to find

527
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,760
all of this undisclosed farmland

528
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,680
and increase tax revenue.

529
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,130
Who is the one in the court that can make this decision now?

530
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,740
His Majesty is still young.

531
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,330
Naturally Empress Dowager Li will be the acting regent,

532
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,520
and Grand Secretary Zhang will assist from the outside.

533
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,520
Grand Secretary Zhang has always been ambitious.

534
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,960
I'm afraid...

535
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,060
Most probably Grand Secretary Zhang

536
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,560
is testing the waters in Mindi.

537
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,280
Look.

538
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,560
It also writes here that

539
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,640
Mindi's Administration Commission said

540
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,840
the people of Min find this convenient.

541
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,010
This means they already completed the pilot test,

542
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,890
and Grand Secretary Zhang's next step

543
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,960
is most likely to be rolling out land remeasurement

544
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,360
across the country.

545
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,560
The prosperity we have here in Fengxing

546
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,120
may bear the brunt of it.

547
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,000
It's probably worse than that.

548
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,730
So,

549
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,490
is he doing it for money?

550
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,170
No.

551
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,600
What Grand Secretary Zhang needs the most

552
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,890
is an archetype.

553
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,080
Correct.

554
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,370
The situation over here

555
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,770
is much more complicated than in Mindi.

556
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,330
What Grand Secretary Zhang needs most

557
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,460
is a case happening in a region

558
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,050
that will allow for cooperation with the central government,

559
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,810
so that when they implement this in the future,

560
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,210
there will be much less resistance.

561
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,720
Inspector Liu is

562
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,210
harboring an ulterior motive.

563
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,570
The reason why he asked those two scribes

564
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,490
to accompany Shuai Jiamo

565
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,010
is not actually to help him,

566
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,600
but to secretly investigate our county's

567
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,650
fish-scale map register.

568
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,730
Inspector Liu

569
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,250
is really sharp.

570
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,880
He read on the bulletin that

571
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,800
land remeasurement has already been done in Mindi,

572
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,410
and immediately thought of Grand Secretary Zhang

573
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,440
wanting to implement it immediately.

574
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,840
At this crucial moment,

575
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,650
if a young regional inspector

576
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,520
can predict the Grand Secretary's concerns,

577
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,580
and roll out

578
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,280
the land remeasurement policy in Fengxing beforehand,

579
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,450
wouldn't he be making

580
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,840
a great contribution?

581
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,120
But I still don't understand,

582
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,290
what does this land remeasurement

583
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,680
have to do with the silk poll tax?

584
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,690
What's the crux of

585
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,650
the silk poll tax issue?

586
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,450
The unequal distribution of tax burden.

587
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,340
Shuai Jiamo keeps

588
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,100
repeating this phrase

589
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,810
every day.

590
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,650
My ears are sore

591
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,490
from hearing it so many times.

592
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,440
If the taxes are not evenly distributed, they will need to be redistributed.

593
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,570
To redistribute it,

594
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,400
you will need to reallocate the tax share

595
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,970
according to the land area of each county.

596
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,090
In order to calculate land area,

597
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,210
naturally you would need to remeasure

598
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,530
the land again.

599
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,920
So this is where Liu Jing's motives

600
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,040
are at.

601
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,360
This is a serious matter.

602
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,730
We should slowly come up with a plan to delay it.

603
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,200
If we rush into things,

604
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,450
it may lead to unpredictable outcomes.

605
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,690
Yes.

606
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,440
The number of gentrymen we have

607
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,480
in Jin'an and Fengxing,

608
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,340
how much land they own,

609
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,130
which of that land is legally bought,

610
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,890
and which are attained by means of trickery or force,

611
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,930
will Liu Jing even be able to investigate all of that?

612
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,490
How much of a ruckus would he have to make?

613
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,760
If Liu Jing manages to accomplish this,

614
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,930
he will definitely be greatly favored by the Grand Secretary.

615
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,850
As for what becomes of

616
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,530
the fate of Jin'an,

617
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,320
it will not be a loss to him anyway.

618
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,720
A vile person like him

619
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,400
wouldn't hesitate to ruin the stability

620
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,450
of a whole prefecture for his own career.

621
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,880
Why don't we just kill him off?

622
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,450
Maybe this is

623
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,800
just the start of it.

624
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,480
But no matter what, he must not get his way in Lanxi.

625
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,560
Otherwise,

626
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,280
it'll be a recipe for disaster.

is famous for its fengshui formations.

631

Now that I'm seeing it for myself,

632
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,050
it is indeed well-deserving of it.

633
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,530
I didn't expect this small village

634
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,960
to have such outstanding natural phenomena.

635

the scenery changes with it.

638
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,920
The view is especially breathtaking at dusk.

639

it's almost like you can feel how Zhuge Liang felt in his twilight years.

646
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,970
The double meaning encapsulated in 'the dusk of Zhuge'

647
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,530
is truly very clever.

Inspector Liu isn't the type who is tempted by money,

No.
