[Episode 4]

4
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,150
Assistant Magistrate Ren.

5
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,000
How are you feeling?

6
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,280
Much better.

7
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,550
Thank you, Prefect Huang.

8
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:40,840
You may rise.

9
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:43,880
I found a good physician in the city

10
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,360
especially for you.

11
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,000
You can

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,560
join the discussion now.

13
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,610
Let's continue to discuss

14
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,759
the Silk Poll Tax.

15
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,720
All of you are busy

16
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,160
with the affairs of your respective counties.

17
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,810
Let's finish the discussion quickly

18
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,990
so you can head back as soon as possible.

19
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,520
Yesterday,

20
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,480
Shuai Jiamo filed a plaint

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,080
and requested that the eight counties of Jin'an

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,620
open their Archives

23
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,479
so he can check the original records.

24
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you think?

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm against it.

26
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,310
Magistrate Mao.

27
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,650
You must have a reason for it.

28
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,840
What reason do I need?

29
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,960
He's just a commoner.

30
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,230
How can we open the Archives to him?

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,780
It will damage the government's authority.

32
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,680
Besides,

33
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,740
if everyone

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,960
follows his lead,

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,200
our county offices

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,340
will never hear the end of it!

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,440
Don't make a scene here, Magistrate Mao.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,250
This is no longer

39
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,180
merely a plaint from a commoner.

40
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,200
This is something

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,329
Jin'an Prefecture must investigate carefully.

42
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,840
The Silk Poll Tax

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,650
has been around for over 100 years.

44
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,960
If we don't open the Archives and check the original records,

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,220
how can we get to the root of the problem?

46
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,480
How can we rectify it?

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,000
I suddenly remembered

48
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,800
that the Houhu Yellow Register Archives in Nanjing

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,810
reported a case

50
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,410
five years ago,

51
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,180
about a father and son who sneaked into Houhu

52
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,570
and tried to tamper with the record

53
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,990
of their ancestral home,

54
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,250
and were arrested for it.

55
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,230
I remember it very clearly.

56
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,410
They were sentenced to strangulation.

57
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,070
It shows that the Archives are a place of importance

58
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,540
and must not be treated lightly.

59
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,940
There are rules to be followed.

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,160
Although our Archives

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,890
are not very grand,

62
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,070
special guards are appointed to stand guard outside.

63
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,250
Even I have to report and register my name

64
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,560
when I go in.

65
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,950
Magistrate Fang.

66
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,800
When you found out that

67
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,020
he had trespassed into the Archives,

68
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,700
why did you let him off so lightly,

69
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,410
with only a flogging?

70
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,380
Are you disregarding

71
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,990
the safety of our country's records?

72
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,540
Magistrate Mao.

73
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,140
Don't say that.

74
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,240
How could I have known

75
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,920
he wanted to raise an uproar

76
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,810
in Jin'an Prefecture?

77
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,980
However,

78
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,329
I passed an order immediately,

79
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,980
prohibiting him from entering the Archives again.

80
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,700
It was no match

81
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,430
for his tricks, though.

82
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,060
We are talking about

83
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,570
the Silk Poll Tax,

84
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,540
not

85
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,600
Shuai Jiamo's sentence.

86
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,320
Prefect Huang,

87
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,430
that's not right.

88
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,019
Shuai Jiamo was ill-intentioned

89
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,370
from the beginning.

90
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,370
If we sit here

91
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,590
talking about the silk tax,

92
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,690
wouldn't we be letting him get the better of us?

93
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,800
You always talk about getting to the root of problems.

94
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,020
We must

95
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,700
get to the root of this.

96
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,130
What are Shuai Jiamo's

97
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,220
ulterior motives?

98
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,560
Why is he creating dispute

99
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,030
around the Silk Poll Tax?

100
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,170
That's right!

101
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,560
Jin'an Prefecture was doing perfectly fine.

102
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,860
Then, he suddenly appeared

103
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,330
and tried to create an uproar.

104
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,640
This is too strange.

105
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,990
When things are strange,

106
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,550
something deeper must be at play.

107
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,980
Shuai Jiamo is an orphan and a bachelor,

108
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,920
he's the only one in his household.

109
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,840
Even if I voided

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,150
the Silk Poll Tax for Renhua County,

111
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,620
what would Shuai Jiamo

112
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,420
get out of it?

113
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,140
That's even stranger.

114
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,360
Why would he do this

115
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,950
if he can't get anything out of it?

116
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,450
Magistrate Deng, look at him.

117
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,020
He's just an arithmetic nut.

118
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,280
What ulterior motives could he have?

119
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,620
I see!

120
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,260
You mean

121
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,870
someone is instructing him!

122
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,870
Everyone.

123
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,630
We are talking about

124
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,600
how to deal with the Silk Poll Tax,

125
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,070
not how to settle old scores with Shuai Jiamo,

126
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,120
nor how to appraise his character.

127
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,520
If someone is diligent for no reason, he must be up to no good.

128
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,620
Think about it.

129
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,840
He's working so hard on something

130
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,060
that doesn't even benefit him.

131
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,190
There must be a greater conspiracy

132
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,500
behind this!

133
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,290
If we ignore

134
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,890
these details

135
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,190
and allow him to lead us on

136
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,960
in discussing the Silk Poll Tax,

137
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,510
we would be missing the point

138
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,150
in a very grave manner.

139
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,670
What exactly do you want?

140
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,520
We want Shuai Jiamo

141
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,360
to make clear

142
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,840
what his true purpose is

143
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,270
in raising the matter of the Silk Poll Tax.

144
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,250
If he cannot make himself clear,

145
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,430
we should follow the example set by the

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,370
yellow register tampering case in Houhu, Nanjing:

147
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,630
punish him severely

148
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,480
as a warning to others.

149
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Shuai Jiamo.

150
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,830
Tell us.

151
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,050
Why did you go

152
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,100
to the Archives?

153
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,770
Yes.

154
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,830
When I helped people

155
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,710
measure their land,

156
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,970
I found that the numbers didn't tally

157
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,950
with those in the fish-scale map registers.

158
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,330
I get a headache

159
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,220
whenever I find anomalies in numbers,

160
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,900
so I went to the Archives to look it up.

161
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,830
At first, I was checking the fish-scale map registers.

162
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,840
Later, it led me to the tax registers.

163
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,600
The numbers

164
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,610
are all related.

165
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,040
Each implicates the others.

166
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,340
Later, I followed the lead

167
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,090
and found

168
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,230
there was a problem

169
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,110
with the Silk Poll Tax.

170
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,700
Enough!

171
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,340
Prefect Huang.

172
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,480
Listen to him.

173
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,690
What nonsense

174
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,330
is he spouting?

175
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,640
Shuai Jiamo!

176
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,910
Be serious.

177
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,670
I am serious.

178
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,700
Looks like

179
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,670
it's up to us

180
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,320
to reveal the truth.

181
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,370
Tell me your name.

182
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,150
I'm a student from Lanxi County,

183
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,920
Cheng Renqing.

184
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,980
How do you know

185
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,150
why Shuai Jiamo went to the Archives?

186
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,130
All the affairs of the world can be boiled down to six words:

187
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,190
common sense, human sentiment, justice, and public-mindedness.

188
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,700
I infer based on common sense,

189
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,880
judge based on human sentiment,

190
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,060
argue based on justice,

191
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,940
and defend based on public-mindedness—

192
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,070
Stop that.

193
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,290
Hurry up and tell us.

194
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,190
We need to trace this back to

195
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,200
20 years ago,

196
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,920
during the 38th year of the Jiajing reign,

197
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,310
when a tragedy happened in Renhua County.

198
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,200
A home caught on fire,

199
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,600
killing a couple

200
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,230
and leaving behind their orphan.

201
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,490
The husband in this couple

202
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,970
was called Shuai Duncheng

203
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,780
and the wife was called Liu Yue'e.

204
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,210
This Shuai Duncheng

205
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,590
was a copyist

206
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,680
in Renhua County's Revenue Office.

207
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,290
He was well-known for being a master of arithmetic.

208
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,250
Cheng Renqing.

209
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,070
Don't talk about irrelevant matters.

210
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,430
Assistant Prefect Song, calm down.

211
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,490
Let him finish.

212
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,860
In the 38th year of the Jiajing reign,

213
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,420
there was a corruption case in Jin'an Prefecture.

214
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,930
It involved a shockingly huge

215
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,490
sum of money.

216
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,350
The Grand Coordinator and Regional Inspector were alerted of this

217
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,620
and their offices issued orders

218
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,840
for a thorough investigation.

219
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,350
After investigating the case,

220
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,169
only one culprit was found.

221
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,830
It was Shuai Duncheng.

222
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,900
Let's set aside the matter of what Shuai Duncheng did

223
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,290
and how he was discovered

224
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,130
for today.

225
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,980
After the incident,

226
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,120
it just so happened that

227
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,460
Shuai Duncheng and Liu Yue'e's house

228
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,340
caught on fire.

229
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,480
Both of them died.

230
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,010
Rumor has it that

231
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,980
they committed suicide to escape punishment.

232
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,920
Only one pitiable orphan

233
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,690
grew up on the charity of his neighbors.

234
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,370
How did you know about this?

235
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,050
Fortunately,

236
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,100
only 20 years has passed since the incident.

237
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,030
Many people should still remember this.

238
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,500
Assistant Magistrate Ren,

239
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,100
am I right?

240
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,420
Yes.

241
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,290
I was in Renhua then.

242
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,740
It was a tragedy.

243
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,710
It's truly lamentable.

244
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,270
Old Mister Ren.

245
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,030
In your opinion,

246
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,540
was there anything suspicious

247
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,060
about Shuai Duncheng's case?

248
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,340
It's hard to say, after such a long time.

249
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,300
However,

250
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,160
the money involved

251
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,680
was probably not pocketed

252
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,480
by Shuai Duncheng alone.

253
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,160
In other words,

254
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,100
something was off with the case.

255
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,530
Yes, but not much more.

256
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,130
It's all in the past.

257
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,390
It has nothing to do with the topic of today's discussion.

258
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,230
No.

259
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,400
Old Mister Ren,

260
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,380
may I know

261
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,550
what kind of case

262
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,280
Shuai Duncheng's case was?

263
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,500
A corruption case.

264
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,240
Shuai Duncheng embezzled 3,530 taels

265
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,880
of the Silk Poll Tax.

266
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,520
He self-immolated to escape punishment.

267
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,590
Although there was something odd about the case,

268
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,100
it wasn't enough to reverse the verdict.

269
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,820
But it was certainly enough

270
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,250
to sow seeds of hatred

271
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,530
in a child's heart.

272
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,820
To think that

273
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,120
Shuai Jiamo is Shuai Duncheng's son.

274
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,090
How unexpected.

275
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,610
How unexpected indeed.

276
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,220
I see.

277
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,540
Both father and son

278
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,430
are involved with the Silk Poll Tax.

279
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,820
A seven-year-old boy

280
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,250
watched his parents

281
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,250
die tragically.

282
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,350
How could he forget?

283
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,320
As he got older,

284
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,450
he understood more about the world,

285
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,460
and so began to question

286
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,300
why his parents

287
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,770
had killed themselves in that fire.

288
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,570
Were they really the culprits

289
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,120
of the corruption case?

290
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,430
His curiosity about the case intensified

291
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,310
as time went by,

292
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,610
and his hatred towards Jin'an Prefecture

293
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,750
deepened!

294
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,400
But even though Shuai Jiamo wanted revenge,

295
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,030
he had no family to rely on,

296
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,800
was not qualified to take the imperial examinations,

297
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,310
and did not have brute strength.

298
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,490
What then?

299
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,660
The only thing he had

300
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,670
was the arithmetic

301
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,510
he had inherited from his father.

302
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,180
He could only use

303
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,270
what he was good at

304
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,790
to take revenge

305
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,420
on the whole of Jin'an Prefecture.

306
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,150
[3,530]

307
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,450
Jiamo.

308
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,460
Remember this number.

309
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,680
What's going on?

310
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,480
Assistant Prefect Song,

311
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,670
Shuai Jiamo is fine.

312
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,770
He just has some repressed emotions in him

313
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,940
that he's unable to vent.

314
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,870
He just needs to drink some sour date water

315
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,260
and get some rest.

316
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,140
Prepare it, quickly.

317
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,150
Okay.

318
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,540
Jiamo, how are you?

319
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,760
I saw my parents.

320
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,790
I saw my parents.

321
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,980
My father was holding a book.

322
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,870
Jiamo.

323
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,710
Cheng Renqing will stop at nothing

324
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,600
to win.

325
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,310
He will strike you

326
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,740
where you are the most vulnerable.

327
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,380
You mustn't take it to heart.

328
00:12:59,050 --> 00:12:59,680
Yes.

329
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,730
I still have to investigate

330
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,730
the silk tax case.

331
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,620
Wait.

332
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,420
You're still thinking about this?

333
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,470
Prefect Huang is still discussing it

334
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,560
with the county magistrates

335
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,330
in the hall.

336
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,250
I haven't explained

337
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,510
the origin of silk tax yet.

338
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,390
What do they have to discuss?

339
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,360
They're not discussing the

340
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,540
silk tax.

341
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,710
They're discussing you.

342
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,790
Everyone.

343
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,100
You're hell-bent

344
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,500
on punishing Shuai Jiamo.

345
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,850
Is there really something wrong

346
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,190
with the Silk Poll Tax?

347
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,640
Prefect Huang.

348
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,230
I want to show you

349
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,370
something.

350
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,010
Take a seat,

351
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,570
all of you.

352
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,470
Prefect Huang.

353
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,790
Assistant Magistrate Ren

354
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,560
is a truly respectable official.

355
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,110
Here.

356
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,620
Yes.

357
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,420
Prepare a pair of new boots

358
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,930
for Assistant Magistrate Ren.

359
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,430
Yes.

360
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,610
Prefect Huang,

361
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,970
I've worn these boots for many years.

362
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,740
I've travelled through mountains and rivers in them,

363
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,670
and I don't know how many times I've mended them.

364
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,530
I didn't mean to make a show of my frugality.

365
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,470
It's just that money is tight.

366
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,440
You know that Wancheng is known for being

367
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,680
seven parts mountain, two parts water, and one part arable land.

368
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,520
But the people not only have to bear

369
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,540
regular taxes during summer and autumn

370
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,300
and apportioned corvée,

371
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,780
there are many other types of miscellaneous corvée work.

372
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,590
A family of three

373
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,730
working nonstop through the year,

374
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,620
sowing in spring and harvesting in autumn,

375
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,520
earns perhaps less than

376
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,440
half a tael of silver.

377
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,950
It's not even enough for a loan

378
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,170
to buy seeds the following year.

379
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,190
Even if I wanted to be corrupt,

380
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,250
it would be like trying to carve flesh

381
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,160
from a mosquito's legs.

382
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,050
The policies are harsh,

383
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,980
and the commoners find it hard to make a living.

384
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,580
That is why no one wants

385
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,770
the position of County Magistrate of Wancheng.

386
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,410
That's how my boots get worn out and

387
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,690
need repeated mending.

388
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,590
I dare not speak about

389
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,950
the Silk Poll Tax.

390
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,890
But I can tell you

391
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,780
what will happen in Wancheng

392
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,850
if a new tax appears all of a sudden.

393
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,400
Those farmers

394
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,830
will have to liquidate

395
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,970
their savings and livestock

396
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,810
in order to pay up.

397
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,790
But they are poor,

398
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,150
and can only borrow money from loan sharks.

399
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,960
They will have to either sell their land

400
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,220
and become métayers,

401
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,250
abandon their land and escape,

402
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,900
or

403
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,390
kill me and the taxmen

404
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,920
and join the bandits.

405
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,610
Every time taxes are raised,

406
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,430
these things happen.

407
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,570
Whether the silk tax is real or not,

408
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,470
I dare not agree

409
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,580
on behalf of my people.

410
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,350
It’s the same for Lanxi County.

411
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,920
If disputes due to a tax increase

412
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,560
cause delay in the transportation of main taxes,

413
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,330
the court will hold me responsible.

414
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,720
When that happens,

415
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,160
I will be forced to resign.

416
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,550
You...

417
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,650
Prefect Huang.

418
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,990
This tax has existed

419
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,390
since before I was born.

420
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
It has been around for over a hundred years.

421
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,590
Even if it were unjust,

422
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,860
it has become the status quo.

423
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,010
We should not be too meticulous about matters of the past.

424
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,980
If you insist on

425
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,450
pursuing the matter,

426
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,500
what if there is something wrong

427
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,010
with the other taxes?

428
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,740
If we open the floodgates,

429
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,020
the controversy will be endless.

430
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,430
I, Prefect Huang, have made a decision

431
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,210
[Jin'an Prefectural Office]

432
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,150
on the silk tax case.

433
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,630
Shuai Jiamo spread false rumors

434
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,020
in an attempt to seek revenge.

435
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,320
He has been detained and will be handed

436
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,420
to the Office of Justice to be sentenced.

437
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,260
People of Renhua,

438
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,830
you are not to talk about this issue

439
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,170
nor spread rumors.

440
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,930
Offenders

441
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,820
will be held accountable.

442
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,840
Go in!

443
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,590
[Honourable and Just]

444
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,720
Buying ham?

445
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,570
Do you want me to show you around?

446
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,250
I'm here to see your brother.

447
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,630
You found out we won the lawsuit

448
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,190
and came to congratulate us, right?

449
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,820
What a coincidence.

450
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,630
He might have been stopped by the people

451
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,060
on his way back.

452
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,860
Your brother

453
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,290
lost the lawsuit.

454
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,560
Your brother is fine for now,

455
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,730
he'll be back soon.

456
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,160
As for Shuai Jiamo,

457
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,040
he wasn't

458
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,260
that lucky.

459
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,030
He was reported

460
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,800
for holding a grudge

461
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,060
because of his parents

462
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,160
and trying to take revenge on the entire Jin'an Prefecture.

463
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,510
His parents

464
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,810
burned to death.

465
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,900
Who said that?

466
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,910
Me.

467
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,420
You?

468
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,100
I have to thank Ms. Feng

469
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,240
for telling me

470
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,500
about Shuai Jiamo's background,

471
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,060
which led me

472
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,080
to discover this piece of information.

473
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,350
Listen to my advice.

474
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,290
Taxes, money, and grains

475
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,890
are of paramount importance

476
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,060
to officials, and to the court.

477
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,920
You're seeking doom

478
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,900
if you interfere in these matters.

479
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,290
You're the one seeking your doom.

480
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,840
I have a second piece of advice.

481
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,400
Interfering with someone making their fortune is akin to killing their parents.

482
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,700
This has been the case since ancient times.

483
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,140
Competing for profit is the gravest type of enmity.

484
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,860
If you want to threaten

485
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,580
the interests of the other seven counties,

486
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,780
do you know how much trouble you will make?

487
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,040
What trouble?

488
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,840
I came to your branch in Tongyang today

489
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,350
to check if the pork you're using

490
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,610
comes from diseased pigs.

491
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,710
I’ll go to your branch in Wancheng tomorrow

492
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,220
to check if there are problems

493
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,350
with your account books.

494
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,150
The day after tomorrow,

495
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,750
Jin'an will send you a note

496
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,220
nominating you for an imperial commission

497
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,350
to send 3,000 jin of

498
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,650
top quality-ham hocks

499
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,910
to the capital for free.

500
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,630
You can abandon your business,

501
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,350
but

502
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,330
do you want to save...

503
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,840
that playboy brother

504
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,240
of yours?

505
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,290
You...

506
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,620
Tell your brother when he comes back

507
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,340
that I've finished writing

508
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,560
a confession for him.

509
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,460
He was deceived by an evil person and couldn't tell truth from falsehood.

510
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,220
He only raised the joint plaint

511
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,940
because he could not turn a friend down.

512

that Shuai Jiamo was indeed trying to take revenge

after leaving the ham shop.

Do you really like her?

522

I want you

to clear Shuai's name.

a new way to prove it—

Why not?

655
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,330
I found a new way

656
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,500
to prove the relationship

657
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,090
between the Silk Poll Tax

658
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:35,970
and the provisions supplement.

659
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,480
As long as I get the original registers,

660
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,530
I can calculate it.

661
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,500
Shuai!

662
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,830

today

664
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,430
because it concerns

665

many important things.

666
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,700
Go ahead.

667
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,600
Was

668
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,680
what Cheng Renqing said yesterday

669
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,250
true?

670
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,380
What?

671
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,060
He said

672
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,150
you're making use of the Silk Poll Tax

673
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,410
to cause trouble in Jin'an Prefecture

674

in order to avenge your parents.

675
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,680
Is that true?

676
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,870
No.

677
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,900

about my parents.

679

I know you don't lie.

680
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,070
But after listening to

681

682
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,380
you responded really strangely

683

and then passed out.

684
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,020
I've never seen that from you before!

685
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,110
I had a splitting headache.

686
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,720
Many things from the past

687
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,580
swept into my mind

688
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,260
like a gust of wind.

689
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,240
But they were all jumbled up.

690
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,600
I couldn't tell

691
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,250
which ones were real

692
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,930
and which ones were fake.

693
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,700
Did you really

694
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:14,880
have no memory of them

695
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,100
before this?

696
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,180
I wish I could remember.

697
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,290
But I can't even remember

698
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,020
what my parents looked like.

699
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,510
In the past,

700
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,400
even if someone scolded me,

701
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,420
saying my father did something wrong,

702
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,850
I could never get angry.

703
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,210
Because I didn't know

704
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,260
what he did.

705
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,210
But you remember

706
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,140
the arithmetic your father taught you.

707
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,300
Because arithmetic

708
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,020
is the only thing

709
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,620
I care about in this world.

710
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,660
You don't understand.

711
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,560
It's like how I could never understand

712
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,940
why you think

713
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,080
brothels and gambling houses

714
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,380
are so fun.

715
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,980
You will also never understand

716
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,710
how interesting arithmetic is.

717
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,210
Interesting?

718
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,990
Numbers are simple by nature.

719
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,630
Arithmetic is the most honest thing

720
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,630
in the world.

721
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,610
One plus one is always two.

722
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,200
Five times four is always twenty.

723
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,090
And the square of 12

724
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,020
is always 144.

725
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,610
People are unpredictable and hard to figure out,

726
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,500
but numbers are simple and never deceive us.

727
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,590
The relationships between numbers

728
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,400
are like the constellations in the sky,

729
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,490
they don't ever change.

730
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,600
As long as you understand

731
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,160
the principles of their workings and the methods of calculation,

732
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,210
you can find out

733
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,170
anything you wish to know!

734
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,480
This is what I pursue!

735
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,040
Even if there are infinitely many numbers,

736
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,630
even if the sums are complex,

737
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,700
fundamental principles allow me to command them!

738
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,210
Perhaps to you,

739
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,260
this is just

740
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,730
a room filled with

741
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,610
tattered official newspapers.

742
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,620
But to me,

743
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,390
this is the way to the abode of the Immortals!

744
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,570
Here, my spirit wanders

745
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,040
up into the heavens and down into the netherworld!

746
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,710
Countless sceneries appear

747
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,590
in a blink of an eye!

748
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,810
What is this, if not true freedom?

749
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,350
What's the difference between this

750
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,920
and becoming an Immortal?

751
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,970
[3,530]

752
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,450
Well said...

753
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,470
What- What does that mean?

754
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,960
I didn't understand either.

755
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,230
But it doesn't matter anymore.

756
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,370
Shuai,

757
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,960
wait for me here.

758
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,250
It's time to change the straw mat.

759
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,850
We'll change it.

760
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,070
-Right away. -Right now.

761
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,140
[Office of Justice]

762
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,070
No.

763
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,130
This is an official document.

764
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,840
A few days ago, Magistrate Fang

765
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,600
handed an official document over to me,

766
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,210
saying he wanted to try

767
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,760
the silk tax case.

768
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,990
Since we reached a conclusion yesterday,

769
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,160
according to standard procedure,

770
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,980
I should write an official document to Magistrate Fang

771
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,570
in return, right?

772
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,340
Ask Renhua County to execute my orders.

773
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,440
You mean I should

774
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,160
turn this official document into a bulletin

775
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,010
in Renhua County's name

776
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,240
to announce the judgement?

777
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,590
This incident caused a ruckus

778
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,980
in Renhua.

779
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,360
Don't we owe the public

780
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,500
an explanation?

781
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,730
If this judgement is announced,

782
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,200
and the people find out

783
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,380
they have to continue

784
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,270
paying this Silk Poll Tax,

785
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,740
I'm afraid

786
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,470
they will object.

787
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,930
How could they?

788
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,040
They will only praise Magistrate Fang

789
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,650
for being considerate of the people.

790
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,050
Prefect Huang,

791
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,580
that makes sense,

792
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,840
but did you know that

793
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,780
even though the people of Renhua

794
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,790
are simple and honest,

795
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,450
there is no lack of scoundrels either.

796
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,290
Shouldn't we

797
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,490
be more aware of their feelings?

798
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,170
You're new here.

799
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,320
If there is a disturbance

800
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,490
in Jin'an Prefecture,

801
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,680
it will be bad for your reputation.

802
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,510
I really don't mind.

803
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,540
Anyway, my orders

804
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,250
are only effective

805
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,969
within this Prefectural Office.

806
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,739
The ones doing the real work

807
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:13,010
are the county magistrates.

808
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,110
Prefect—

809
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,290
I have made copies

810
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,969
of this official document

811
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,230
for the county magistrates

812
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,530
of Lanxi, Wancheng, and Tongyang.

813
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,500
I believe

814
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,590
they will publicize it soon.

815
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,909
Go back and handle it according to the rules.

816
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,630
Prefect- Prefect Huang—

817
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,429
See him out!

818
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,610
Are you here to submit the confession?

819
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,949
Come back with me.

820
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,800
No, Sister!

821
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,449
I thought of a way to save Dummy.

822
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,290
You-

823
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,610
What could you think of?

824
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,860
[Flog 40 times, Exile 3,000 li away]

825
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,170
[Flog 40 times, Exile 3,000 li away]

826
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,890
Do you want to save Shuai Jiamo

827
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,900
or kill him?

828
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,910
Look at

829
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,330
what you wrote.

830
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:04,920
You want them

831
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,010
to punish him severely?

832
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,980
Slow down.

833
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,960
This is why it's brilliant.

834
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,770
Brilliant?

835
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,070
It's worth my effort

836
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,710
spending the whole night working on it.

837
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,590
Get to the point!

838
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,280
The ones who want to punish Shuai

839
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,880
are the four county magistrates.

840
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,400
Prefect Huang still supports us.

841
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,540
Why did he order Shuai's arrest then?

842
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,680
He was forced to by the circumstances.

843
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,530
But when he gave the order,

844
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,490
he said

845
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,850
he was detaining Shuai Jiamo

846
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,280
for the Office of Justice to sentence him.

847
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,560
Hush.

848
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,940
If Prefect Huang

849
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,280
really wanted to punish Shuai,

850
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,170
he would have given the order himself!

851
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,430
He's letting the

852
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,770
Office of Justice handle it

853
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,660
to hint that

854
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,680
he wants to wash his hands of the matter.

Prefect Huang has already hinted at his intentions,
