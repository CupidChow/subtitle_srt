Fast couriers live there all year long.

Whenever a government document

is sent there,

38
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,280
the fast courier has to begin sprinting.

39
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,100

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,080
the fire wouldn't have gotten this big.

174

If you had called for help earlier,

175
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,680
your parents wouldn't have died.

176
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,680
Good grief!

How old were you then?

180
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,400
What could you have done?

181
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,240
It was an accident.

182

Do you feel better?

186

Do you remember the book

187
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,630
my father wrote?

188
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,060
He seemed to have

189
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,110
recorded something very important

190
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,580

192

It was called the Art of Gathering Projected Steps.

193
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,410
But I can't remember its content and title

194

no matter how hard I try.

195
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,520
You've been thinking about it all night,

196
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,320
and you still can't remember.

197
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,450
Don't think about it anymore.

198
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:33,850
Goodbye.

199

Mr. Zhuang Santi, right?

200
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,220
Nice to meet you.

201
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,950

202
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,090

Alright.

Sir,

208
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,890
this is a government relay station.

209
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,150
We only serve travelers from government offices.

all the officials who are currently on duty.

It's written in this document that

His Majesty has granted him

access to relay stations on his way back to his hometown.

It's only valid once,

and applies only to the officials themselves.

226
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,020
Does the document specify a validity period?

227
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,370
No.

228
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,010
Does it specify any geographical limits

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,270
for the access to relay stations?

230

No.

You people.

236
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,140
You're always abusing your authority,

237
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,610
using government relay stations even while on private business.

238

in which direction the government office's gates open,

and how to write your plaint.

Are you crazy?

The silk tax

253

doesn't even affect the two of you.

Go on.

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,240
Which government office should we go to to file our plaint?

258
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,280
Fine.

259
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,210
If you want to seek your own doom,

What is this?

268
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,930
There are so many numbers,

269
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,650
and so much calculation.

270
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,780
Look, the emendations at the beginning

271
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,700
are a mess.

272
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,710
Who wrote it?

273
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,550
It's Prefect Huang—

274
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,330
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhuang.

275
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,550
How should we write it then?

276
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,830
It's beyond repair.

277
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,020
How about this?

278
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,240
I'll take it upon myself

279
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,580
to write another one for you.

280
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:27,760
And then

281
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,560
I'll just charge you a scribal fee.

282
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,070
Alright.

283
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,200
I brought paper and ink.

284
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,040
Write it now.

285
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,720
Shuai!

286
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,400
Let me take care of it.

287
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,160
Let me take care of it.

288
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,470
Mr. Zhuang.

289
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,350
You can...

290
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,820
write it at home.

291
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,030
But...

292
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,670
you have to tell us

293
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,180
what we should do next.

294
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,010
It seems filing a lawsuit

295
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,610
is not the way to go.

296
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,960
I've never heard of a commoner suing the government.

297
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,340
You can request a retrial on the basis of correcting an error.

298
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,860
What do you mean?

299
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,080
You should know this, you're a government student.

300
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,220
Retrial on the basis of correcting an error

301
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,150
is when you sue an official

302
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,960
for mishandling a particular case,

303
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,600
and request a re-investigation at a higher level.

304
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,330
You can report it to the Provincial Surveillance Commission.

305
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,550
Yes, the Provincial Surveillance Commission!

306
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,410
Marvelous!

307
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,500
Mr. Zhuang, here!

308
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,700
Oh dear.

309
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,000
I suddenly thought of

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,430
two more problems.

311
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,490
The first

312
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,420
is that-

313
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,610
Jin'an Prefecture

314
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,040
has already conferred and passed judgement.

315
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,090
I don't think the Provincial Surveillance Commission

316
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,010
will give you

317
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,850
a judgement directly.

318
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,830
Otherwise, they would be rebuffing

319
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,000
the Prefect and the eight County Magistrates.

320
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,970
Am I right?

321
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,860
I'm guessing

322
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,040
when your request for a retrial is submitted,

323
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,940
the Provincial Surveillance Commission will send it back to Jin'an Prefecture

324
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,620
and ask your Prefect to start a new investigation.

325
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,590
Wait, he would be trying his own case.

326
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,310
What difference

327
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,190
could it make?

328
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,790
Maybe this is the reason

329
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,590
he wanted us to come here.

330
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,930
I've figured it out!

331
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,490
As long as his superiors agree to a retrial,

332
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,540
Prefect Huang-

333
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,220
Wait-

334
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,520
He just wants an excuse

335
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,360
to re-investigate!

336
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,210
So we can submit a request for a retrial,

337
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:12,580
right?

338
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,890
-Right? -Yes.

339
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,260
Wait!

340
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,680
You came up with...

341
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,660
such a brilliant idea?

342
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,430
That doesn't matter, Young Master.

343
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,280
The most troublesome thing now is filing an overstepping lawsuit!

344
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,960
What is an overstepping lawsuit?

345
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,180
As a government student,

346
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,270
shouldn't you know what an overstepping lawsuit is?

347
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,910
The Great Ming Code

348
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,210
clearly states that

349
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,140
when commoners

350
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
engage in a lawsuit

351
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,740
or file a report,

352
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,130
they must go level by level.

353
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,220
First, they must get a township elder to mediate.

354
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,140
If that fails, they must get the village head

355
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,940
to uphold justice.

356
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,780
If they cannot agree on a just outcome,

357
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,630
they will go to the prefect and the county magistrate.

358
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,390
Look at you.

359
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,940
You're skipping the prefectural and county levels.

360
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,200
Listen up,

361
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:48,790
kid.

362
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,300
Whether you're in the right or not,

363
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,020
you'll be flogged 20 times once you get to the hall.

364
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,530
Are you ready for that?

365
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes.

366
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,000
No. W- W- Wait.

367
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,970
No.

368
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,680
Mr. Zhuang.

369
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,030
Isn't 20 times

370
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,040
too much?

371
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,140
That's the rule here.

372
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,190
But you can't just

373
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,240
flog someone

374
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,540
without getting the situation clear first.

375
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,520
What I told you

376
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,030
are the rules on paper.

377
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,380
In private,

378
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,510
I can find you a middleman

379
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,360
who specializes in dealing with government offices.

380
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,030
Thank you, Mr. Zhuang.

381
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,410
One tael of silver.

382
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,530
One tael and five mace.

383
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,910
I might as well

384
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,800
go get flogged.

385
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,150
Even if you do that,

386
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,200
you will have to

387
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,670
pay the workers in charge of the flogging

388
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,350
for them to go easy on you.

389
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,240
If not,

390
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,040
getting flogged 20 times

391
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,400
could cost you your life.

392
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,400
You can't

393
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,290
save this money either way.

394
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,490
So, getting flogged one time

395
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,750
is worth one mace?

396
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,440
One stroke is seven fen and five hao.

397
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,490
One mace is wrong.

398
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,190
This is just the cost of the overstepping lawsuit.

399
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,950
You two will still need to

400
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,380
present your plaint to the Provincial Surveillance Commission.

401
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,900
You will have to prepare money for paper and ink as well.

402
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,160
We brought the paper and ink ourselves.

403
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,130
It's all written.

404
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,000
The paper and ink you brought do not comply with the regulations.

405
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,480
Also, the Provincial Surveillance Commission

406
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,990
do not accept plaints everyday.

407
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,630
Only the functionaries in the office

408
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,100
will know

409
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,200
when they are open to accept plaints,

410
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,460
and who the Assistant Surveillance Commissioner-in-charge is.

411
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,770
The more you pay, the faster your investigation goes.

412
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,280
Isn't this

413
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,820
daylight robbery?

414
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,920
Too expensive?

415
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,720
Why don't you

416
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,740
settle everything yourself then?

417
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,240
Wait.

418
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,160
Why is there

419
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,090
an Assistant Surveillance Commissioner?

420
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,020
Fengxing is huge.

421
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,700
The Surveillance Commissioner can't handle everything alone,

422
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,670
so he delegates to

423
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,600
a Surveillance Vice Commissioner,

424
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,860
an Assistant Surveillance Commissioner,

425
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,540
a Troop Purifying Commissioner, an Education-intendant,

426
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,340
the State Farms Bureau, the Military Defense Circuit,

427
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,220
and so on.

428
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,240
It's important to go to the right person.

429
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,400
My new memorandum is good,

430
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,200
right?

431
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,630
As for the scribal fee,

432
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,430
I'll give you a discount!

433
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,710
Didn't you say

434
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,760
it will be delivered today?

435
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,020
You have no idea.

436
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,569
The functionaries in the Communications Office

437
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,540
line things up according to the money they get.

438
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,720
So what?

439
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,020
I paid up!

440
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,410
You did.

441
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,000
But others

442
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,349
paid more.

443
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,790
The format of the plaint was wrong.

444
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,099
We need to get a Legal Secretary to vet it.

445
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,710
There is still the stamping fee, transportation fee,

446
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,260
and the wages of the runners.

447
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,660
When traveling 100 li, the halfway mark is at 90 li.

448
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,670
You've already spent so much money.

449
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,510
If you stop now,

450
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,480
it would all have been in vain.

451
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,690
After all this time, we haven't even seen

452
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,370
the government office.

453
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,500
All we do is give you money.

454
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,800
Wait a while more.

455
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,270
Calm down.

456
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,110
Soon,

457
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,040
it will be the day to accept plaints.

458
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,550
You will only have to submit this memorandum then,

459
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,470
and all will be well.

460
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,760
[Peaceful and Prosperous Times]

461
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,170
Freshly made cakes.

462
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,380
No, no.

463
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,890
No matter what,

464
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,270
I must follow you to the government office today.

465
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,950
Young Master,

466
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,470
I've been in this business for more than 10 years

467
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,200
by my trustworthiness alone.

468
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,620
Today,

469
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,830
I will definitely get it done.

470
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,350
Cut the crap.

471
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,070
I always say that to my sister.

472
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,910
Fine.

473
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,970
Please come with me then.

474
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,160
Shuai.

475
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,500
I'm going to the government office.

476
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,840
Wait for me at the gambling house.

477
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,450
Gambling house?

478
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,570
Come on.

479
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,540
Let's go.

480
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,010
Out of the way!

481
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,390
Out of the way!

482
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,400
Out of the way!

483
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,210
Out of the way!

484
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,380
Move!

485
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,930
Out of the way!

486
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,150
Move!

487
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,880
Move!

488
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,680
Move!

489
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,650
Out of the way!

490
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,450
Let go of me!

491
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,720
Let go of me!

492
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,960
Let go of me!

493
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,470
Let go of me!

494
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,580
I can swim!

495
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,260
I can swim!

496
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,230
Aren't you curious

497
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,290
why I suddenly came to the provincial capital?

498
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,090
Are you here to argue with me?

499
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,910
You are really an arithmetic nut.

500
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,460
No matter what,

501
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,930
even though I can swim,

502
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,870
I must still thank you

503
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,390
for saving me.

504
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,890
If anyone dies in front of me again,

505
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,530
I will be scared

506
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,100
and sad.

507
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,860
You're a dummy,

508
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,750
and a good person.

509
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,840
In this day and age,

510
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,780
it seems only dummies

511
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,370
can be good people.

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,740
He felled you with one blow.

684
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,460
I don't think it'll be possible

685
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,970
for you to file your plaint at the local level.

686
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,190
What about the Grand Coordinator's Office?

687
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,540
When we first met,

688
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,080
you said

689
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,470
the Provincial Administration Commission, Provincial Surveillance Commission,

690
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,220
and the Regional Military Commission

691
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,610
are all local government offices.

692
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,620
Beside them,

693
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,960
there is a Grand Coordinator

694
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,050
and a Regional Inspector.

695
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,490
Your friend's memory

696
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,410
is pretty good.

697
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,400
Let's go to the

698
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,610
the Grand Coordinator of Fengxing.

699
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,300
The current Grand Coordinator

700
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,770
is His Excellency Li Shida.

701
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,240
He is indeed

702
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,870
the highest-ranking official in Fengxing.

703
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,060
But

704
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,280
you two can't even enter

705
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,040
the Grand Coordinator's Office.

706
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,130
And he only accepts appeals

707
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,810
from the local level.

708
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,400
What about the Regional Inspector's Office?

709
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,740
Sure.

710
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,170
We can indeed

711
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,220
go to the Regional Inspector.

712
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,010
Look.

713
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,570
The Regional Inspector was

714
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,000
sent by the court to monitor local officials.

715
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,050
His title

716
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,600
is attached to the Censorate.

717
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,400
He has no connections

718
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,110
to local government.

719
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,040
He has fewer considerations this way.

720
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,310
But there is a problem.

721
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,790
Do- Do we need money?

722
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,890
Do you still have money?

723
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,040
No.

724
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,010
Isn't that it?

725
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,320
The most important thing

726
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,000
about the Regional Inspector

727
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,810
is in the word "inspector."

728
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,200
He has to go on inspection tours,

729
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,630
so you can't find him

730
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,850
in the provincial capital.

731
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,610
But...

732
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,710
Let me see.

733
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,430
The Regional Inspector

734
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,750
should have reached...

735
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,020
Yanzhou Prefecture.

736
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,160
Yes, Yanzhou Prefecture.

737
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,930
We will pass by Yanzhou

738
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,490
on our way back to Renhua.

739
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,670
Cheng Renqing!

740
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,110
Are you here to mock us?

741
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm here to give you a piece of advice.

742
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,140
Could you be so kind?

743
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,780
If I were you,

744
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,670
I won't go back to Renhua for now.

745
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,140
Thank you.

746
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,150
We're not going back to Renhua.

747
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,460
My sister said

748
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,840
we can only believe half of what you say.

749
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,320
That's all I have to say.

750
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,740
Good luck.

751
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,960
[Inn]

752
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,730
Second Brother!

753
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:26,830
Second Brother!

754
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,660
Brother.

755
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,510
They should have succeeded by now, right?

756
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,400
No way.

757
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,120
It's been so long.

758
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,310
Hurry up.

759
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,530
Hurry. The relay station is ahead.

760
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,240
Hurry!

761
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,290
Keep up!

762
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,760
-Yes. -Yes.

763
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,900
Hurry up!

764
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,870
Hurry up!

765
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,300
Keep up!

766
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,080
Hurry up!

767
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,050
It's right ahead!

768
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:50,970
Hurry!

769
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,520
Useless!

770
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,070
Keep up!

771
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:52,910
Hurry!

772
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,420
Sir!

773
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,680
Officer.

774
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,260
What brings you here

775
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,310
at this hour?

776
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,150
We received a report

777
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,290
that there are robbers inside.

778
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:04,620
Go!

779
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,510
Get everyone inside

780
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,260
to gather here!

781
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:06,980
Hurry!

782
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:11,600
Hurry up!

783
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,250
Sir!

784
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,510
Get up!

785
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,350
Get up!

786
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,610
Come on, gather at the door. Hurry!

787
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,580
Everyone,

788
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,720
get up!

789
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,600
The officers are here to investigate!

790
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,060
Get up!

791
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,150
Hurry up. Get up!

792
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:24,910
Hurry!

793
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,380
Bring your clothes and assemble at the door!

794
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,690
And you, at the gate!

795
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,380
What are you looking at? I'm talking to you!

796
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,180
Get up!

797
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,140
-Gather at the door! -Gather at the door!

798
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,150
-Hurry. -Hurry.

799
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,240
Hurry up!

800
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,380
Hurry up!

801
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,090
Go!

802
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,520
Go!

803
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:42,970
Officer.

804
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,360
They are all here.

805
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,740
They are all here.

806
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,810
I received a report

807
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,450
that there are robbers here,

808
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,710
trying to rob travelers.

809
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,680
Is that true?

810
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,130
Didn't you see any thieves?

811
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,350
-No. -No.

812
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,360
No.

813
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,950
I think the robbers

814
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,210
must be hidden among you.

815
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,469
You two

816
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,730
look rather unfamilar.

817
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,580
You don't look like locals.

818
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,510
What are your names, where are your hometowns,

819
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,730
and why are you here?

820
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,530
Officer.

821
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,949
I am Feng Baoyu.

822
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,760
I'm a Government Student of Renhua County, Jin'an Prefecture.

823
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,690
We just finished settling some business in the provincial capital,

824
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,699
and are rushing back to Renhua.

825
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,980
These are our traveler's papers.

826
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,340
[Signed, Feng’s Ham Shop]

827
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,250
You look delicate.

828
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,179
You don't look like a robber.

829
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,400
What about you?

830
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,330
Shuai Jiamo.

831
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,010
I'm from Renhua County of Jin'an Prefecture.

832
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:36,850
I came to the provincial capital

833
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,239
to file a plaint with the Fengxing Provincial Surveillance Commission

834
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,510
regarding the silk tax case in Renhua County.

835
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,020
Cut the crap.

836
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,239
It's not crap.

837
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,500
I have numbers to prove it.

838
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,590
I can show you.

839
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:46,929
Shuai.

840
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,690
Officer.

841
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,610
This is my friend.

842
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,330
We're traveling together.

843
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,590
He is such a nut for accounting,

844
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,560
it's made him a dummy. Please don't mind him.

845
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,699
Even fools can do accounting nowadays?

846
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:57,770
You.

847
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:58,950
Officer.

848
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,250
I'm a local.

849
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:00,750
A local?

850
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,300
Yes.

851
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,760
Put it away.

852
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:02,350
Okay.

853
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,140
You.

854
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,070
Come here.

855
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,060
I'm talking to you.

856
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,450
Yes, you. Beardy.

857
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,380
Come here!

858
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,460
Officer.

859
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,560
Name, hometown?

860
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,650
Lu Feilong.

861
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,570
I'm from Jin'an Prefecture,

862
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,920
Tongyang County.

863
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,970
I'm here to collect debt.

864
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,610
Collect debt?

865
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,330
My traveler's papers are here.

866
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,450
It's strange today.

867
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,050
I've met three people from Jin'an.

868
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,900
Lu Feilong.

869
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,510
Why did you come all the way from Jin'an

870
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,030
to Yanzhou to collect debt?

871
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,540
It's just a few shops.

872
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,970
Officer, he's lying.

873
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,930
He's not from Tongyang,

874
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,770
he's from Lanxi County.

875
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,820
I am from Tongyang.

876
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,910
You're from Lanxi County?

877
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,840
-You own a gambling house. -Officer, listen to me.

878
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,800
Don't listen to nonsense.

879
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,480
Alright. Stop yelling.

880
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,460
Let me ask you.

881
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,100
Did you see

882
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,730
anyone suspicious

883
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,650
in this relay station?

884
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,960
I usually fall asleep immediately after lying down.

885
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,300
I didn’t notice anything.

886
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,310
No, Officer.

887
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,610
He really runs a gambling house.

888
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,540
He opened a gambling house

889
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,130
in Renhua.

890
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:09,630
You...

891
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,600
Who's here to open a gambling house?

892
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,690
Isn't it you, Lu Feilong?

893
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,570
You are from Lanxi.

894
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,080
All right.

895
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,220
Lu Feilong.

896
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,560
Come here.

897
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,820
Come here.

898
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:21,940
Master Lu,

899
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,930
if you want to open a gambling house in Yanzhou,

900
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,730
you have to report to me,

901
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,920
and you must open it with me.

902
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,480
These are the rules.

903
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:32,980
I understand.

904
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,490
Do you understand?

905
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,160
Yes.

906
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,430
Alright.

907
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,480
No robbers

908
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,490
were found today.

909
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,960
Go back to sleep.

910
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,260
Let's go.

911
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,820
Let's go.

912
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,380
Let's go.

913
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,100
Let's go.

914
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,180
Remember.

915
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,830
Stop.

916
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,430
Hurry up!

917
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:53,830
Hurry!

918
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,170
Brother.

919
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,890
Is the mission still on?

920
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,030
What do you think?

921
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,720
That officer

922
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,190
is already suspicious of me.

923
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,580
If they are killed,

924
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,050
I would be the prime suspect.

925
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,070
What should we do then?

926
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,390
Sleep.
