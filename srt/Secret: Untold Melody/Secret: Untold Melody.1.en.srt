<i>In all my life, I never
believed in miracles.</i>

2
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:43,261
<i>But I'm going to you
though I can't meet you.</i>

3
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,557
<i>Hoping for a miracle...</i>

4
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,863
That's Kim Yu Jun.

5
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:07,110
What an outstanding profile.

6
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:28,701
What's going on?

7
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:31,362
I don't know why he thinks
something is not right.

8
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:32,901
Is he okay?

9
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,515
Think he's trembling.

10
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:36,523
Yeah, he's not okay.

11
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:45,308
Oh, my god. Is he okay?

12
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,558
Wh-What is happening?

13
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,413
Oh, my goodness. Somebody, come help!

14
00:02:51,414 --> 00:02:54,468
- It's an emergency.
- Someone just went down.

15
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:56,375
Sir, you okay?

16
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,734
Sir?

17
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:13,393
Why isn't he picking up?

18
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,405
You gave me a different code.

19
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,617
You should say "wrong" not
"different". Forgot all your Korean?

20
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,119
Why'd you change it?

21
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,666
Too many women came by,
so I had to change it, you know?

22
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,543
Why is this place so dirty?

23
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:42,379
You're the neat freak, so you clean.

24
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,742
While you're here, you
clean and I cook dinner.

25
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:50,137
I didn't expect a welcoming party,

26
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:54,391
but no enthusiasm for your son
you haven't seen in five years?

27
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:59,187
Enthusiasm? So I should've held
a welcome banner at the airport?

28
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:02,883
Congrats on failing the
competition to come here.

29
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:06,042
Kick me while I'm down, why don't you?

30
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:07,904
Maybe it's for the best!

31
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:11,074
Have some fun and date girls.

32
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,993
How can you be an artist
without knowing love?

33
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:15,705
- Stop. Stop nagging.
- Don't sit at the piano all day!

34
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:18,710
- I'm hanging up. Later!
- Wait! Don't hang...

[SECRET: UNTOLD MELODY]

36
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,013
I saw the news on your competition.
You're here as an exchange student?

37
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,466
Don't read up on me.

38
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,814
"Pianist Kim Yu Jun says
he'll stay six months in Korea

39
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:26,900
to relax and focus on
recovering his wrist."

40
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,402
Is this wrong?

41
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:31,822
I have to study, not relax.

42
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:34,158
You need good grades too?

43
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:40,247
This is the music building.

44
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:42,165
- It's nice.
- Isn't it?

45
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,944
But it'll be torn down and
rebuilt after this semester.

46
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:50,158
Wanna go and meet some
classmates before class starts?

47
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,343
No, I want to check out the school.

48
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:56,725
Okay, then. Call me if
you get lost or anything.

49
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,561
Okay. Thanks.

50
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:08,461
What are you doing?

51
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,123
Oh, no.

52
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:18,989
Are you okay?

53
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:45,831
You have dust on your hair.

54
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,922
I haven't seen you before.

55
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,924
Are you a returning student?

56
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:59,369
I'm an exchange student. A
junior in Instrumental Music.

57
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,785
I'm a junior too.

58
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:03,288
I'm Yoo Jung Ah. And you?

59
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:07,131
I'm Kim Yu Jun.

60
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:16,542
- You played well.
- What?

61
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,614
The piano.

62
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:22,112
It sounded nice, so I came in.

63
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,761
What comes to mind first
when you think of Chopin?

64
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:41,353
He was poor.

65
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,980
He was a romanticist.

66
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,017
His pieces are hard to play.

67
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,185
The poet of the piano!

68
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:51,352
- Anything else?
- Excuse me.

69
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,112
You, looking toward the back.

70
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:01,448
Who? Me? Yes.

71
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:02,891
What comes to your mind?

72
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:05,931
Me? George Sand.

73
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:06,974
Why?

74
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:13,126
Chopin loved her and
lived with her for 10 years.

75
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:16,964
He composed countless
beautiful pieces for her.

76
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,052
Right. George Sand.

77
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:26,890
I guess we can thank her
for Chopin's beautiful music.

78
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:31,336
They say he kept pieces of her
hair with him even when he died.

79
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,048
That's so romantic just like his music.

80
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:39,402
Next week, we'll study Schubert's
piano quintet, "The Trout".

81
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:44,307
For a week, I hope you'll
be inspired by nature like him.

82
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:45,935
Yes, ma'am!

83
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,390
Were you looking for me?

84
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,767
No, I wasn't.

85
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,769
You weren't?

86
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:13,729
Bye, then.

87
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,827
What were you playing back there?

88
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,906
Seriously, I think it's great.

89
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:33,650
It's a secret.

90
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:43,715
Wait!

91
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,063
What is it?

92
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:49,771
Nothing. Thanks for your help earlier.

93
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,644
What's he saying?

94
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:06,052
You play piano well.

95
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:09,063
I'm pretty good.

96
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:12,600
Will you play it for me again?

97
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:16,171
I don't want to.

98
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:19,919
But I want to hear it.

99
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,497
- You saw me in class, right?
- What?

100
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:26,627
Let's welcome our
guest with a big hand!

00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:33,850
We'll show you psychological
magic! We'll read your mind!

102
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:35,186
Pick a card.

103
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:42,776
You fell for someone
at first sight here.

104
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:46,571
She likes you back. How exciting!

105
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,683
Now, the next card! What
do you want from her tonight?

106
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,621
- Pick a card.
- Attention, please!

107
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,281
- You trash! This is what you want?
- Trash?

108
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:06,867
This is what he wants! He's trash!

109
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,385
No! This is wrong.

110
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:12,305
Isn't this too sexy
for the first meeting?

111
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:14,557
- Too fast!
- It's way too fast for this.

112
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:17,894
- They're weird. Don't join!
- Come and join our magic club!

113
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:19,605
- Give me that!
- No way!

114
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,550
- Give it over!
- Oh, no!

115
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:52,699
I gotta go.

116
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:56,224
Should we wrap up?

117
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:58,251
I hope you find true love.

118
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:02,256
We are the magic club. Hogoowarts!

119
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:09,696
Myungwoon College of Music
will join the College of Fine Arts

120
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:12,824
and become the music
department in the College of Arts.

121
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:19,455
So our 70th anniversary
concert will be even more special.

122
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:23,001
- The music building will be...
- What? Looking for someone?

123
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,212
demolished right after
our last concert there.

124
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:30,300
There'll be piano concertos
performed by our students.

125
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:35,847
The pianist will be decided
through a competition as usual.

126
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:42,879
<i>Let's find out more on the weather.</i>

127
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,424

[LET'S DO THE DISHES
AND CLEAN THE TABLE]

129
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:06,961
Jeez.

130
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,257
I'm a good, good son.

131
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:18,432
This is confusing.

132
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:26,607
The next chord is hard.

133
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,202
Student rep? Explain, please?

134
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,656
- In Hee!
- Yes?

135
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:48,836
It goes from D, F,
B-flat to E, G-sharp, B.

136
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,004
Good!

137
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,298
You peeked over, but that's right!

138
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,466
Nice.

139
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:56,803
In classical music,
augmented fourths aren't used.

140
00:14:56,804 --> 00:15:00,600
The first inversion contains
an interval of the minor sixth.

141
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,730
Thus, it's called the
Neapolitan sixth chord.

142
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:06,522
What should we eat?

143
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,444
- Wait, In Hee.
- What?

144
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,572
I forgot I have to go. Let's
eat together next time.

145
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:20,368
What? Then you buy next time.

146
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:21,104
Okay.

147
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:24,064
- Help me with harmonics too!
- Okay. Sorry!

148
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:39,722

00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,768
Long time no see, Trash.

Looking for a music score.

152
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,508
What music?

153
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,053
Arthur Binder.

154
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,370
Mad Rush?

155
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:58,949
How do you know?

156
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,078
I don't think that score is here.

157
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,173
It's not here either?

158
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,044
Too bad. I wanted to play it.

159
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,880
It's hard to get Binder's scores.

160
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,011
Do you skip class often?

161
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,262
Why? Did you look for me?

162
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:24,542
It's not that...

163
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:27,769
Just wondered where you were.

164
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,771
Where else?

165
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,315
I was behind you.

166
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,072
Did you do the Western
music history homework?

167
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:40,932
What homework?

168
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,643
She said to see the trout.

169
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:45,913
She did?

170
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,292
I was on my way now. Wanna go?

171
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,753
Together?

172
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,798
Don't want to?

173

- Professor!
- Hi.

174
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:05,348
- Professor!
- What is it?

175
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,642
It's Professor Kim.

176
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:08,628
Lunch, please!

177
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:10,754
Having lunch with an old man is no fun!

178
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:15,191
He's still quite popular.

179
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:16,926

It doesn't hurt at all when I practice,

on stage and I couldn't breathe.

190
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:50,978
So I ran away here to Korea.

191
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,774
Running away is best for that.

the 1st inversion of the 2nd interval's
root and the 5th lowered a half step.

212
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:29,221
In a minor key, you lower a half
step, then do the 1st inversion.

00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:57,693
When you first started, you'd play
the Flea Waltz with your mom there.

362
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,570
Why remember that?

363
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:05,201
Why not? There aren't many
happy moments like that in life.

364
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:11,373
The tickets sold out as
soon as they went on sale.

365
00:34:11,374 --> 00:34:13,126
Your mom is amazing.

366
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:16,379
Whoa.

367
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,883
How in the world did you marry Mom?

368
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:26,012
She's into handsome men,
you know. Loved my face.

369
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:28,140
She chased me around,
so I had to marry her.

370
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:29,891
That's crazy!

371
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:31,084
Cut it out!

372
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:32,670
Go and enjoy it for me.

373
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:34,688
What about you?

374
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:37,190
I'm watching a
baseball game that night.

375
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,861
Artists must watch a lot of sports.

376
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:43,116
They are hard to get.
Take your girlfriend.

377
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:49,120
- Jeez!
- Careful!

378
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:55,667
I used to carry two boxes
like this, no problem.

379
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:58,361
That's why you have a bad back.

380
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,572
Quiet.

381
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:04,134
Stop nagging and tell
me about your boyfriend.

382
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,428
I don't have a boyfriend.

383
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:07,722
Yes, you do.

384
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:11,316
No! Who says I have a boyfriend?

385
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,652
There's someone at school.

386
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:17,481
Is it obvious?

387
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:21,359
You catch on quick.

388
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,571
They call me Detective Kang.

389
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,116
When will you introduce me to him?

390
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:29,744
He's hard to meet.

391
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:33,831
Why? Is he a playboy?

392
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,209
No.

393
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:41,421
Why you!

394
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:49,054
85, 86, 87, 88.

395
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:52,141
- The macaroons are so good!
- I know!

396
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:56,353
Look! The piano battle is starting!

397
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,604
- Now?
- Really?

398
00:35:57,605 --> 00:36:00,148
- We gotta go!
- Come on.

399
00:36:00,149 --> 00:36:01,317
Hurry up.

400
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:11,034
In this piano battle,
for the first time,

401
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,745
Choi Tae Hyuk seeks to
win three times in a row.

402
00:36:13,746 --> 00:36:17,874
Kim Yu Jun dares to
challenge him for the crown.

403
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:22,087
The battle will start off
with the Italian Polka.

404
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:23,547
What's going on?

405
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,799
It's a piano battle.

406
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,912
Choi Tae Hyuk will play the
polka first, followed by Impromptus.

407
00:36:30,913 --> 00:36:35,251
Now! Let the piano battle begin!

408
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,577
Isn't he great?

409
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:48,770
Awesome, Yu Jun!

410
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:51,065
Insane! Wow!

411
00:40:57,213 --> 00:40:59,739
You're good. It was fun.

412
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,283
Thanks. I had fun too.

413
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:06,163
Kim Yu Jun!

414
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:08,790
You can't have this.

415
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,833
I didn't even ask for it.

416
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,669
- You look like you want it.
- Then, give it!

417
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,463
No!

418
00:41:13,464 --> 00:41:14,488
- Why!
- No way!

419
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:18,742
- Come on! I asked you for it!
- No!

420
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:20,718
No way!

421
00:41:29,078 --> 00:41:30,687
Someone's here.

422
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,356
Let's go somewhere else.

423
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,198
Have some chicken.

424
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,182
I'm not eating.

425
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:10,102
Gave her the music score?

426
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,271
Who?

427
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:16,942
The girl. Didn't you give it to her?

428
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,070
How'd you know?

429
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:24,491
A guy who wouldn't play
suddenly joined a piano battle?

430
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:28,606
When it's odd, you
throw love into the pot.

431
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,609
That tends to explain things.

432
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:34,835
Dad.

433
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:43,476
There's someone in our school
who doesn't use a cell phone.

434
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,180
Weird, huh?

435
00:42:48,558 --> 00:42:52,143
Ten years ago, I had a
student named Jin Seok.

436
00:42:52,144 --> 00:42:54,937
He was the most diligent student.

437
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:58,399
Then he started missing
classes and practices.

438
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,860
If he came, he'd take naps.

439
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:05,239
Sometimes he came in
drunk and yelled like crazy.

440
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,992
I wondered what was
wrong, so I asked him.

441
00:43:07,993 --> 00:43:12,060
Why did a classical guy
suddenly turn heavy metal?

442
00:43:12,061 --> 00:43:13,740
Why?

443
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:14,849
Why do you think?

444
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,834
Because of love again?

445
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:18,586
That's right.

446
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:23,257
He said he met the most
beautiful girl at a gym.

447
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:24,742
A gym?

448
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:26,495
Lots of people meet there.

449
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:31,432
But oddly enough, the
girl didn't have a cell phone.

450
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,936
And she kept skipping out on him.

451
00:43:34,853 --> 00:43:39,692
When he asked her why, she
said crazy things happened.

452
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,277
The buses she took got into accidents.

453
00:43:43,278 --> 00:43:45,947
Her parents kept getting sick.

454
00:43:45,948 --> 00:43:51,160
Then she said her younger
brother, who'd pick her up, died.

455
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,912
He died? Suddenly?

456
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:54,247
That's right.

457
00:43:54,248 --> 00:43:56,232
- Weird, right?
- Yeah.

458
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,609
Then one day,

459
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:01,629
the dead brother came to him.

460
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,965
What? A ghost?

461
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:05,425
No.

462
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:07,013
Her husband.

463
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:10,851
Not her brother but
husband! She was married.

464
00:44:11,657 --> 00:44:15,184
What woman doesn't have a
phone these days? A married one!

465
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,854
Hold on.

466
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,273
Who's married in our department?

467
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:21,674
Is it Kim Yu Ri, the TA?

468
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:24,344
What are you talking about?

469
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:27,405
Then lecturer Park Eun Ji?

470
00:44:27,406 --> 00:44:29,866
- Her husband is a volleyball player.
- Cut it out!

471
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,743
- He'll spike you!
- Stop it!

472
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:33,745
You look like a volleyball.

473
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:35,080
Why you!

474
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,926
[CHAN KYU LOVES SO HYANG]

475
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:51,930
[I MISS YOU]

476
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,518
Kim Yu Jun!

477
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:01,982
Wait!

478
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,571
Brought your bike? Let's ride
along the river walk. It's pretty.

479
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:12,283
Riverwalk? For what?

480
00:45:12,284 --> 00:45:14,977
Why not? It's nice there.

481
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,022
I can't today. Next time.

482
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,345
Fine. Then let's ride next time.

483
00:45:20,346 --> 00:45:21,459
Okay.

484
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,069
See ya.

485
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,321
- Bye.
- Bye!

486
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:29,635
Must be nice.

487
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:32,179
What?

488
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:34,431
The river walk.

489
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:37,309
Not interested.

490
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:44,108
Why? Is something up?

491
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:48,869
What was up with you? I
haven't seen you in a while.

492
00:45:50,728 --> 00:45:53,435
Stuff came up at home.

493
00:45:53,436 --> 00:45:54,520
I see.

494
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:59,164
I heard you won the
battle. That's amazing.

495
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:04,169
Here.

496
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,800
- Arthur Binder?
- Yup.

497
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:12,636
You joined the battle for this?

498
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:15,055
Nope.

499
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:19,726
You're right. I did.

500
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:22,473
I really wanted this!

501
00:46:23,188 --> 00:46:25,607
- Can I seriously have it?
- It's yours.

502
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:27,900
Thanks.

503
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:30,112
- Look at the back.
- Hmm?

504
00:46:32,942 --> 00:46:35,569
Call me, Jung Ah.
[KIM Yu Jun]

505
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:43,691
- I should do you a favor too.
- Really?

506
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:46,403
Then come with me somewhere.

507
00:46:54,653 --> 00:46:55,887
Want me to help?

508
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:58,557
No, I'm almost done. Hold on.

509
00:47:15,244 --> 00:47:17,770
Is Professor Kim Seung Ho your dad?

510
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:18,856
Huh?

511
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:22,706
Yes.

512
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,253
Come on. Let's eat.

513
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,048
Okay.

514
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:39,096
You cooked pig's trotters
to make Jokbal?

515
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:40,873
It's not Jokbal.

516
00:47:40,874 --> 00:47:43,919
It's Schweinshaxe, a
famous German dish.

517
00:47:48,817 --> 00:47:49,900
Try it.

518
00:47:59,092 --> 00:48:00,326
How is it?

519
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:02,371
Wow!

520
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:05,915
It's unique!

521
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,708
It's not good?

522
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:09,002
It's great!

523
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:11,838
It's sort of like Jokbal.

524
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,137
It's not! It's Schweinshaxe.
It's a German dish.

525
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:20,262
Let's go to a concert this Friday.

526
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:22,891
Ha Yeon Seo tickets are hard to get.

527
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:25,936
Great.

528
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:30,147
When is Professor Kim coming?

529
00:48:30,148 --> 00:48:35,027
He'll be back late. He has many
meetings on rebuilding the music school.

530
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:36,446
Rebuilding?

531
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:40,287
You didn't know? They're
tearing it down to rebuild.

532
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:42,853
When?

533
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,581
At night, right after
the school concert.

534
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:50,794
- You're done, right?
- Yup.

535
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:55,047
Yu Jun.

536
00:48:55,048 --> 00:49:00,804
Wanna hear the piece I
played on the first day we met?

537
00:49:52,898 --> 00:49:54,191
Why play so fast?

538
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,359
I play fast before I go home.

539
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,445
Before you go home?

540
00:49:59,446 --> 00:50:01,198
It's hard to memorize.

541
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:06,702
Don't play this piece at
the practice room we met in.

542
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:07,746
Why not?

543
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:12,242
Because the piano there is too old.

544
00:50:13,752 --> 00:50:17,380
I love this piece. Please
play it on new pianos.

545
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:19,925
Sure.

546
00:50:21,927 --> 00:50:24,429
- Can you play me something?
- Me?

547
00:50:30,602 --> 00:50:34,480
Not now, but on the concert day.

548
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:37,567

552
00:51:07,517 --> 00:51:10,103
I feel some emotions
only when I play piano.

553
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:14,312
Heart fluttering, excitement,

554
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:19,776
thrill and fear.

555
00:51:21,736 --> 00:51:24,114

Who's that?

604
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,039
You mean Lim Jung Ah, the violin major?

605
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,043
Yoo Jung Ah, the piano
major. She's in our classes.

Do you know her?

607
00:57:54,546 --> 00:57:56,714
No, I've never heard that name.

608
00:57:57,966 --> 00:58:01,578
She must be in a different department.

609
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,289
I have nothing on her.

610
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,328

Hello. Is Jung Ah home?

612
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:35,253
You have the wrong house.

613
00:58:54,188 --> 00:58:56,107
It was in 1985.

614
00:58:57,321 --> 00:59:02,529
My classmate Shin Jun Woo met
Kim Hye Jin at the club association.

615
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:04,973
She was the hottest
girl in engineering.

616
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:09,165
Jun Woo worked hard to be with her.

617
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:13,045
He made sure all the
men gave up on her.

618
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:17,836
When her ex-boyfriend kept
calling, he pushed him into a river.

619
00:59:17,837 --> 00:59:19,213
He killed him?

620
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:23,551
No, it was shallow. Just to about here.

621
00:59:25,637 --> 00:59:30,496
Then one day, a man in a suit appeared.

622
00:59:30,497 --> 00:59:32,826
- A husband again?
- No.

623
00:59:32,827 --> 00:59:34,302
A National Security agent.

624
00:59:34,979 --> 00:59:37,148
She was a spy from the North.

625
00:59:38,524 --> 00:59:40,468
- Dad.
- What?

626
00:59:41,252 --> 00:59:42,861
I'm tired today.

627
00:59:42,862 --> 00:59:44,614
Right. Get some rest.

00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,702

629
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,790
- We're still a divided country.
- Go!

630
01:00:28,633 --> 01:00:31,827
If I play this fast from
the start of the 2nd theme,

631
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,855
there's more tension in
the piano and orchestra,

632
01:00:34,856 --> 01:00:37,483
but Chopin's sense of romance is lost.

633
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,755
But if I play slowly like this,

634
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:49,762
it contrasts with the 1st theme and
all the themes can sound independent.

635
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:53,140
Then in the concerto,

636
01:00:53,141 --> 01:00:55,852
the orchestra becomes more pronounced.

637
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,648
What?

638
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:03,192
Nothing.

639
01:01:04,235 --> 01:01:06,362
I can feel what you mean.

640
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:11,159
How can you capture
Chopin's Romance so well?

641
01:01:12,577 --> 01:01:14,871
Do you have a crush on someone?

642
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,293
Perhaps.

643
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:51,449
Is something wrong?

644
01:01:52,992 --> 01:01:54,911
No, everything's fine.

645
01:01:59,165 --> 01:02:01,250

It shows both fancy techniques
and the art of Fuge.

667
01:03:47,315 --> 01:03:50,276
It's a piece that creates
dramatic tension.
