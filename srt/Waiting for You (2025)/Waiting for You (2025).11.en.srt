1
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,480
where is this

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,640
Xuan Pei

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,080
Xuan Pei, wake up quickly

4
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,560
Hurry up, wake up

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,520
It seems like we are in another world

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,720
Xuan Pei

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,680
It's strange that there was a sound here just now.

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,480
Why is there no one?

9
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,360
But where has Sir Tong Feng gone?

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,800
Have you found all the pools?

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,480
Yes, this is the last pool.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,080
If all the pools fail to find them

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
It's very possible that they fell into the Xiuwei Well.

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
You won't carry it like this, right?

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,920
It's broken now

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
If they fall into the illusion from the cultivation well

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,400
The mana of the adults and Tong Feng will be sealed

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,720
They can't return to Jiuyou by themselves

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
So can we find them?

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
Thirty million layers of illusion

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,920
if you want to find them

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,640
It can only be checked one by one through the Sansheng Mirror.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,320
Sister, are you okay?

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,800
It's okay, it's okay, I just picked up my bag

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Fortunately there was no bleeding

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,480
Who are you, little sister?

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,200
My name is Wanwan

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,200
elder sister

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,040
Why do you care so much about this gangster?

30
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,320
He is not a gangster

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,280
He just ate the wrong thing

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,960
Little sister, do you know where this is?

33
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,480
This is the changing room of Paramount.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,760
Aren't you the dancing sister here?

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,040
It seems that I fell into an illusion

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
What’s going on with Li Dafu’s hot springs?

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,240
Little sister, we accidentally broke into this place

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,880
I want to ask

39
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,240
Do you know where I can go out?

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,680
We are being hunted

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
Can't let others see

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,680
I see

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,360
You and the gangster brother eloped together.

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,240
Sister, do you want to take this brother with you?

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,720
I'm carrying him

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,760
Fortunately, I haven't taken any chances in martial arts classes recently.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,480
Otherwise, I would definitely not be able to carry Xuan Pei today.

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,720
Sister, do you have somewhere to go?

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,680
Still fainting without him

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,840
Wanwan, do you know this area?

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,600
Is there a place without people?

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,880
Sister, why don’t you go to Wanwan’s house?

53
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,600
It's my brother who knocked him unconscious

54
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
Uncle Lin educated me

55
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,680
Don't be an irresponsible person

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
Thank you Wanwan

57
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,120
Sister Tongfeng, this is my home

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,880
your home

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,440
How does your home look?

60
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,920
It looks so much like a hotel

61
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,400
Yes, this is Uncle Guo’s hotel

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,440
Uncle Lin and I are temporarily staying here.

63
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,720
But sister, don’t worry

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,480
Uncle Guo is also a good man

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,920
Uncle Guo, I'm back

66
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,000
Xuan Pei, wake up

67
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,120
here it is

68
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,280
Li Dafu

69
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,440
Not even your spells

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,040
I thought it was just mine

71
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Xuan Pei, what the hell is going on?

72
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,080
Why did we end up in an illusion?

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,440
There must be something wrong with the hot springs.

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,040
Li Dafu's hot springs

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,200
Very close to Xiuwei Well

76
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,240
Then we have no magic

77
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,400
Does that mean I can’t go back to Jiuyou?

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
Ah Ming must have discovered it

79
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,240
Will pick us up soon

80
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,040
Don't worry

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,920
Um

82
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,680
Xuan Pei

83
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,840
Did you eat something wrong today?

84
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,760
It should be a type of medicine

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,720
The effect of the medicine has expired

86
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,280
Wanwan

87
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,640
Rogue brother, wake up

88
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,760
Rogue brother

89
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,120
Wanwan

90
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,000
My sister has nothing to eat at home

91
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,200
Uncle Guo and Uncle Lin are neither at home.

92
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,080
This is the bread I just stole at Paramount

93
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,040
Wanwan, there’s nothing to eat at home. Aren’t you hungry?

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,080
Hungry but I feel

95
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,280
The gangster brother and sister must be hungrier

96
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,160
Uncle Lin must be back

97
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,200
I'll open the door

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,720
good

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,080
Take a walk

100
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,800
Wanwan

101
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
You must dare to block Mr. Wang's way

102
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,440
Just wait until death without a complete body

103
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,600
Who is Mr. Wang?

104
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,080
Fuck me

105
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,360
Xuan Pei

106
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,160
Rogue brother, you are so awesome

107
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,360
Xuan Pei, you are so powerful without any magic power

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,080
Although there is no magic power

109
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
But there is still some force

110
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,120
Wanwan, were you afraid just now?

111
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,440
Not afraid

112
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,560
Those people must have been sent by Wang Ruonian again

113
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,320
Who is Wang Ruonian

114
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,160
Uncle Lin has been refusing to tell me

115
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
But I actually already know it

116
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,400
That person is my father

117
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,280
He has been chasing Uncle Lin and me

118
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,440
It is not advisable to stay here for a long time

119
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Let's withdraw first

120
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,560
No, no, no

121
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm afraid they will bully Uncle Lin

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,080
Brother and sister, let’s go find Uncle Lin, okay?

123
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,160
Walk Wanwan

124
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,920
I've always wanted to come to a lively place like this

125
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,920
But Uncle Lin always won't let me come.

126
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,120
So lively

127
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,080
Xuan Pei is just telling the story here

128
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,600
Is it the Republic of China period that often shows?

129
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,320
Yes, it is now the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China

130
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,760
Although the Republic of China was short-lived

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,880
But it is true that historically

132
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,040
a very special period

133
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,840
What’s so special about it?

134
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,520
Light and darkness intertwined

135
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,400
Decay and rebirth coexist

136
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,600
Then this period

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,120
Are there many spies and spies?

138
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,880
Often these agents and spies

139
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
with those enemies

140
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,520
A very romantic love story unfolds

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,920
What have you been watching lately?

142
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,840
All I saw were

143
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
Hot buns

144
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
You two want to buy buns?

145
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,360
Come two

146
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,720
Wanwan, are you hungry?

147
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
We have no spells now

148
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,600
There was no common currency in the Republic of China.

149
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,800
Think of a solution first

150
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,400
OK OK

151
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,400
So hard-working

152
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,720
What are they doing this for?

153
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
Did you see that ring?

154
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,560
That was something belonging to the last queen of the previous dynasty.

155
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,800
It's called Jiufeng Ring

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,160
There is a divine ring on it

157
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,680
Those who obtain this precept will be protected by gods

158
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,160
Can be an official

159
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Except for the ring

160
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,880
And those hundreds of dollars?

161
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,080
Who doesn’t want to win?

162
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,920
No wonder the fight was so fierce

163
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
If I have the skills

164
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,600
I'll fight too

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,880
Then who told us not to know martial arts?

166
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,880
Does anyone else want to challenge this warrior?

167
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,000
If no one responds

168
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,040
Jiufeng Ring will return

169
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,720
I'll come

170
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,520
Which rich man is this?

171
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,600
Come to the ring before weaning

172
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,720
Okay, great, great

173
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,840
sharp

174
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,960
So beautiful. Wanwan likes it so much.

175
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,760
Xuan Pei, look at those people

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,840
Were they the same people who just wanted to kidnap Wanwan?

177
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,760
It's them. They have more people this time.

178
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,480
Let's withdraw first

179
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,000
Chase over there quickly

180
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,880
stop

181
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,080
Chase

182
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,280
stop

183
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,720
Don't run

184
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,480
stop

185
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,400
stop

186
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,280
quick

187
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,280
stop

188
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,840
hurry up

189
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,280
Why haven't those two actors come yet?

190
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,600
Director, don't be angry

191
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,440
These two are newcomers

192
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,200
Don't understand the rules

193
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Why did you two come here?

194
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,000
Here you have a child

195
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,200
Didn't see it before

196
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,800
You two are a young couple.

197
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,040
Hurry up and put on makeup

198
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,280
Find a place for this kid to stay

199
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,040
Every day wastes my time

200
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,680
Xuan Pei

201
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,240
There are many people here

202
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,040
It's safer to let Wanwan hide first

203
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,760
Wanwan, go there and hide

204
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,600
Let's deal with it. Come on.

205
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,760
Not famous, but not arrogant

206
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,800
Mr. Li

207
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,040
Are you willing to be under the witness of God?

208
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,320
Married to Ms. Zhang

209
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,760
from now to eternity

210
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,160
Look for it. It's nearby.

211
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,440
Look over there

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,600
what are you doing

213
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,560
Xuan Pei, let’s go

214
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,680
Don't be afraid

215
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,480
did you see a child

216
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,880
What kid, get out of here

217
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,400
We are all Mr. Wang’s people

218
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,560
What are you?

219
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
Dare to command us

220
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Brothers, search for me

221
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,640
Are you looking for trouble?

222
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,920
Don't even ask about it

223
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,880
Who did our Youyou Film Company fear?

224
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you want to try it?

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,280
Brother, the boss of Youyou Film Company

226
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,480
It seems that the eldest young master asked us to be polite

227
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

228
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
It turns out to be Youyou Film Company

229
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,880
It's because we are too blind to recognize Mount Tai.

230
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,560
Go, go, go, go, go

231
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,440
Keep shooting

232
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,280
Mr. Li

233
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,840
Are you willing to be the witness of God?

234
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,480
Married to Ms. Zhang

235
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,160
from now to eternity

236
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,400
No matter in good times or bad times

237
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,360
rich or poor

238
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,320
health or disease

239
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,040
happy or sad

240
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,080
You will always love Ms. Zhang

241
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,080
Until death do you part

242
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,360
I do

243
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,400
Miss Zhang

244
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,080
Are you willing to be the witness of God?

245
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,920
Married Mr. Li

246
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,760
from now to eternity

247
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,280
No matter in good times or bad times

248
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,200
rich or poor

249
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
health or disease

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,880
happy or sad

251
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
You will always love Mr. Li

252
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,600
until death do you part

253
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,960
I do

254
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,840
boss

255
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,840
elder sister

256
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,040
Were you getting married just now?

257
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,240
So beautiful. She would be so beautiful if she got married.

258
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,840
Wanwan also wants to get married

259
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
We weren't getting married just now

260
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
we are making a movie

261
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,760
Xuan Pei

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
Is that the movie we just shot?

263
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,240
It’s the same as what I saw in Jiuyou

264
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,920
Movies of this period were in black and white

265
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,400
It’s not the same as Jiuyou’s

266
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,640
I really want to see me in the movie

267
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,480
what would it be like

268
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,120
Wanwan

269
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,360
Uncle Lin

270
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,840
How can you be with a stranger

271
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,760
Brother and sister are not strangers

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,200
They're so kind to me

273
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,760
He also bought me so much food

274
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,280
I don’t know either of you

275
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,960
What harm do you have to this child who just turned eight?

276
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,800
He actually tricked her out of her home

277
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,760
No no

278
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,560
you misunderstood

279
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,000
we we

280
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,560
Uncle Lin and Wang Ruonian's people came to the hotel again

281
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,320
It was my brother and sister who saved me

282
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,040
It turned out to be two saviors

283
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,520
Lin Qingduo is guilty

284
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,680
Look at the two Haihans

285
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,400
It's okay

286
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,680
Actually we

287
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,000
In fact, it was Wanwan who took us in

288
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,080
In that case, why don't you two follow me back to the hotel?

289
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,920
There are acquaintances of ours there

290
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,240
It would be nice for us to have a place to stay.

291
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,040
Uncle Lin, haven't we been discovered?

292
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,160
Do you have to go back?

293
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't worry

294
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,120
Uncle Guo has a hiding place for us.

295
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,480
We can have a good sleep when we go back tonight

296
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,840
soon

297
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,520
Uncle Lin

298
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,560
I won't let you suffer from such bumps anymore

299
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,240
The hotel business has been so good recently

300
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,880
This is the last room left

301
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,440
You probably won't mind, right?

302
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,320
we don't

303
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,120
don't mind don't mind

304
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,360
Mr. Lin should have something to say to us.

305
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,800
Is Lin Qing Wang Ruonian really Wanwan’s biological father?

306
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
Why did he want to kill Wanwan?

307
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,920
I shouldn't have told anyone about this

308
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Wanwan is Ningcheng

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,360
The most luxurious young master of the Wang family

310
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,280
Wang Ruonian's daughter

311
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,120
Wang Ruonian doesn’t like Wanwan’s biological mother

312
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,040
Insulting Wanwan’s mother-in-law in every possible way

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,280
After Wanwan’s mother-in-law gave birth to Wanwan,

314
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,080
unbearable to be humiliated

315
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,800
Then committed suicide

316
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,680
When Wanwan was six years old

317
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,520
I accidentally heard Wang Ruonian’s secret

318
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,360
A six-year-old child

319
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,680
Even if I see

320
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,960
What can you understand?

321
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,040
But he still killed the child

322
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
I tried my best to bring Wanwan out of the palace

323
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,920
Over the years, I have taken Wanwan to hide in Tibet

324
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,840
Hiding until now

325
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,400
I need to take a long trip recently

326
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,200
The owner of the hotel will take care of Wanwan

327
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,480
If Wang Ruonian comes again,

328
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,000
Please, you two, protect Wanwan

329
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,800
Wanwan

330
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,800
What secrets do you know about Wang Ruonian?

331
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,360
We must kill her to death

332
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,280
This matter is related to the reputation of the eldest mistress

333
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,360
I forgive Lin Qing for not telling you two.

334
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,800
Lin Qing

335
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,240
The gangsters have searched here.

336
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,360
Quickly take Wanwan to the warehouse to hide.

337
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,520
Mr. Lin must protect Wanwan well

338
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,960
I'm in the room with her

339
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,920
There won't be any danger

340
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,960
Then please, sir and madam, be more careful.

341
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,200
Xuan Pei, I feel so uneasy

342
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,840
Lin Qing must have some secret

343
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,720
didn't tell us

344
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,400
He and Wanwan are not close friends.

345
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,800
Why must we pave the way for her?

346
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,400
Where are you? Come out

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,600
Look over there

348
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,960
Will Sister Lin Shutongfeng and the others be fine?

349
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,960
Don't worry, they'll be fine

350
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,960
Open the door. Open the door quickly. Let's check people.

351
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,320
Could it be the gang of hooligans just now?

352
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,640
What should I do if they come in?
