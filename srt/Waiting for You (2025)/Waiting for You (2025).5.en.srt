1
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,400
It’s because the good luck of the third life has disappeared.

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,880
The good luck in the third life is not good enough

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,400
Do you know how difficult it is to survive the third life?

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,680
So

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Not only do I want him to be reincarnated with his memories,

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
I also want to change his destiny

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,080
Are you trying to change his life?

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,920
Are you trying to change my life?

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,480
Smash my job

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,760
what are you afraid of

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,680
At worst, you move to Biluo

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,160
I'll give you half of my meal

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,280
We are souls who can only be greedy but not hungry

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,200
It doesn’t matter if you don’t eat

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm just afraid that I won't have anywhere to live by then

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,440
What if the adults blame me then?

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,440
You get half of my house

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,520
Still have to be responsible

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,080
Providing my daily supply of sweets

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,360
no problem

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,160
yes

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,720
We are souls who can only be greedy but not hungry

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Where did you go during the day?

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,680
What is this

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,880
I'm afraid you didn't have dinner

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Plum blossom cake made for you

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,080
So delicious

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,320
Eat slowly or your stomach will be upset

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm not a living person, I'm a soul

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,040
How could it be uncomfortable?

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,920
Xuan Pei said it again

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,800
I have something to ask you

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,920
we are souls

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,760
Is it possible to avoid eating?

35
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,400
Yes, the soul does not have the trap of a mortal body

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,000
Naturally there will be no feeling of hunger

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,400
Wangchuan Soup Shop

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
Delivering food in Jiuyou all day long

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,560
In fact, it is to deliver Wangchuan soup to those

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,880
In the hands of the soul who needs to forget his past life

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,320
Little Mencius spent all day researching new dishes

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
In fact, it’s just those new souls who have arrived in Jiuyou

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,720
Can't get used to it for a while

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,760
Eat two meals occasionally

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,360
but you and me

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
We don't need to eat at all, right?

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,920
Even if it is to be done

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,400
You can use magic

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,200
Then why do you cook with your own hands every day?

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,440
Is the plum blossom cake I made today delicious?

51
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,600
delicious delicious

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,400
Very delicious

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,360
That boiled fish I made yesterday?

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,760
And sweet and sour pork ribs?

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,680
Super awesome

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
Is there any left?

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
Before that

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,440
I made beggar's chicken and braised prawns.

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,240
What you said made me hungry

60
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,600
This is the reason

61
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,480
Yes, is it because I'm greedy?

62
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,520
Living a repetitive life every day

63
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,600
After a long time, you will forget the time

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,240
If something different happens every day

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
Even if it's just a meal

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400
I will also have more expectations for the future

67
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,240
Isn't it?

68
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,640
It’s rare to get off work so early today

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,720
or

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,040
How about we go to Xiao Mengzi's shop for a few drinks?

71
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,280
I'll go if you treat me

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,680
I invite you

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,000
This is the first time in a thousand years that you want to treat me to a guest.

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,320
Then let's go quickly

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,800
Let's go

76
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
Let's go

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's go

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,760
Just leave

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,480
You can go to reincarnation with peace of mind

80
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,640
Just leave the matter of luck in the third life to me.

81
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,400
I'm not afraid of luck in three lifetimes

82
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,200
It's my memory

83
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,480
Just don’t drink Wangchuan soup

84
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
But you have to remember

85
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
Things in Jiuyou

86
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,520
Not even a single word can be revealed to the mortal world.

87
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,480
Thank you girl

88
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,160
Don't do this

89
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,320
Girl, I want to ask you one more question

90
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,400
You told me last time

91
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,480
My daughter will be safe for the rest of her life

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
But it's true

93
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,120
You are not worried at all

94
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
Is it your own chance?

95
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,360
You use luck

96
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,000
In exchange for a chance to meet again

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,960
Logically speaking

98
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,400
You will have a very hard life

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,680
No matter how hard it is, I still enjoy it.

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,960
Actually I don't quite understand

101
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,800
Is this the love mentioned in the play?

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,120
There are many kinds of love in this world

103
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,800
Father's love, mother's love, children's love

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,440
couple love friends love

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,360
Every kind of love is different

106
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,080
This is so complicated

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,680
It's not complicated for you

108
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
I slowly felt it myself

109
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,680
Because there is a difference between love and love

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,640
I will think about it carefully

111
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,840
Go and be reincarnated as soon as possible

112
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,680
I guess Ma Yichun will soon be unable to bear it.

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,480
You go quickly

114
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,680
eight eight fifty six

115
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,720
Little Mencius

116
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
Another ten jugs of good wine to rinse your mouth with

117
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,680
What mouthwash

118
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,080
I love Ma Yichun as a friend

119
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,280
What about Xuan Pei? What kind of love do I have for Xuan Pei?

120
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,400
What kind of love does Xuan Pei have for me?

121
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,200
fatherly love

122
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
You scared me

123
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,280
Is it true that you walk without making a sound?

124
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,000
Then you think so intently

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,640
Of course you can't find me

126
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,840
I have something to do with that

127
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,880
I'm leaving first

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
really

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,160
Not drinking Wangchuan soup will affect your luck in the third life

130
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,640
What's going on?

131
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,560
The sixty-sixth reincarnation of Zhang Juqian

132
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,240
Born in the 18th year of the Li Dynasty

133
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,520
Ah Ming

134
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,200
Has anything big happened in Jiuyou recently?

135
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,080
No

136
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
everything works fine

137
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,560
Sir, what's the matter with you today?

138
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,960
I suddenly remembered

139
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,880
Something fell on Biluo

140
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,400
Come with me

141
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,720
The sixty-sixth reincarnation

142
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,440
Finally finished

143
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,120
you

144
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,200
Why is it you again?

145
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,280
I've seen it all

146
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,440
You caught me again

147
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Now that I've caught you

148
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,840
That little Tongfeng you

149
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,520
Do you want to let me handle it?

150
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
How do you deal with it?

151
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,720
I want something

152
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,080
something something

153
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,120
It's not too expensive.

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,920
In this case

155
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,480
You will look like a little Tongfeng

156
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,720
Very insincere

157
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,480
you

158
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,640
It's acceptable if it's a little more expensive.

159
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,720
I want

160
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,280
you

161
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,560
what do you want me to do

162
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,240
I want you to embroider a sachet for me

163
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,640
sachet

164
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,600
I can't embroider sachets

165
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
Little Mencius

166
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,040
Please teach me

167
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,520
I can't embroider sachets

168
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Look, my hands have been embroidered like this recently.

169
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,920
I don’t know how to use sachets

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,800
Go find seductress

171
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
He is probably the only one in Jiuyou

172
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,960
Men who love cosmetics will know it

173
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,240
Only he can

174
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
Then we can only find him

175
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,560
Seductive brother

176
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
When does get out of class end?

177
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,840
Look, look, what I embroidered

178
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,080
you

179
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,080
Blaspheming art

180
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,720
So annoying

181
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,720
This Si Mo

182
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,880
You must let me embroider the sachet

183
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,280
Why do you want me to embroider it?

184
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,960
So annoying, so annoying

185
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,200
Annoying Simo

186
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,520
There is actually something better in this world than

187
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,680
Things that are more annoying in history class

188
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,920
So annoying

189
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,080
Tongfeng, what are you doing?

190
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,680
I'm embroidering a sachet

191
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,360
Why are you embroidering this for me? How tiring it is?

192
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,520
this little fool

193
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,760
But on weekdays I

194
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,200
I don’t have the habit of wearing sachets either.

195
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,440
I know

196
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
You don't usually do this

197
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,520
I can wear this belt

198
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,080
But this color

199
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,600
Let's eat something first

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,720
Don't eat

201
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,040
What pattern are you embroidering?

202
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,760
My brother seduces me.

203
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
He said he wanted me to embroider a puppy using backstitch.

204
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,000
dog

205
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,040
This seduction

206
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,080
Deduct his salary later

207
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,200
But I’m still embroidering the pattern next to it

208
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,720
Xuan Pei

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,120
What color do you think is better for Ruyi pattern?

210
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,000
Purple

211
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,320
Purple

212
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,040
Sir, why did you call me?

213
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,360
I heard about Tong Feng

214
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,520
I've been learning embroidery from you recently.

215
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,760
Yeah that idiot

216
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,480
Finger pricked hundreds of times

217
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,160
Just barely learned it

218
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,360
She is not willing to give up like this

219
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,560
I don't know what possessed her.

220
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,480
Must embroider

221
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,400
I said she was stupid

222
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
If you can't learn, why bother with me?

223
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,600
Dogs are so difficult to embroider

224
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,640
Definitely not good at embroidering

225
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
Dogs are already the simplest

226
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,960
There really is nothing simpler than a dog.

227
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,320
Then why not embroider mandarin ducks?

228
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,800
mandarin duck

229
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,040
That's the top level of difficulty

230
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,000
She can embroider that

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,040
Embroidery

232
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,840
Don’t talk about physical resemblance but seek spiritual resemblance

233
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,800
Do you understand

234
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,960
Understood

235
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,880
Just understand

236
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,080
What do you understand? I don’t understand anything.

237
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,800
It's okay

238
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,640
You go back first

239
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,600
I'll go to your rouge shop to find you later.

240
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,080
Bring the lipstick in your store

241
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,080
Ten of the same

242
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,120
Send them all to Biluo

243
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,440
Sir, are you going to expel us?

244
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,880
Give me some more money before expulsion

245
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,800
Your brain

246
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,480
Bosses, please go slowly

247
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,360
To embroider this crap for you

248
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,480
My hands are almost swollen from being poked

249
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,600
Tongfeng is embroidering sachets for others

250
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,680
I have to hang it up for others.

251
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,560
I advise you not to be too arrogant

252
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,480
I'm arrogant

253
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,560
you

254
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,600
How about it

255
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,040
OK

256
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,440
To thank you for the sachet you embroidered for me

257
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,880
I treat you to Guiyun Bridge

258
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,520
The most delicious one is Colorful Yunduo

259
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,160
How about it

260
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,520
You two take your things back to Biluo first.

261
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,160
guest officer

262
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,600
What material do you want the clothes to be made of?

263
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,400
Flowing brocade or water cloud satin

264
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,120
We have everything here

265
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Just match it with the purple sachet

266
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Come and see which one you like

267
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,280
this

268
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,960
This one

269
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,720
boss

270
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,840
OK

271
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,600
Look at your body

272
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,080
Like a noble god

273
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,920
God will look at you more often when he sees you today

274
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,200
I license your shop

275
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,160
Another thousand years

276
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,640
Sir, please go slowly

277
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,040
turn out to be

278
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
It's for him
