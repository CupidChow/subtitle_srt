1
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,840
Meng Dihua

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,400
Meng Dihua

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,000
It's over, it's over, the game is about to begin

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
Where did Meng Dihua go?

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,880
Meng Dihua

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,720
Tongfeng Tongfeng

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,600
Quick, quick, quick, drink this soup.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,160
Haori continued to score points through smashes in this game

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,120
Tong Feng needs to find his own rhythm.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,680
What's going on? I suddenly want to sleep.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,520
The second game has already started

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,280
It's over, it's over

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
Player Tong Feng’s condition seems to have declined.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,280
Continuous mistakes

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,880
What's going on

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Oh, boss lady, where have you been?

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,520
Let me have a good meal

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,040
let me drink some let me drink some

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,600
this

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,600
What's going on?

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,080
This death sign

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,680
I don’t know how to point towards my own people.

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,680
That Yuzhi obviously hit Tongfeng on purpose.

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,840
Fujun Demon Lord

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,160
Just a little soul

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,640
You guys are a little too nervous, right?

27
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,880
I just don’t allow anyone to be in Jiuyou

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,200
disregard the law

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
The next game is between Jiuyou and Demon Realm

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,920
God is not worried

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,720
It makes sense

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,240
how could i

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,080
Got knocked down by a small badminton ball and fell to the ground

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,200
No problem with this ball

35
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,280
The feathers on the badminton are from my feather clan

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,560
Naturally obey my orders

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,720
It's up to you

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
Where can I see the key?

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,840
You will definitely lose this round

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,240
Come on I can do it

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
No matter what you did to this badminton,

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,640
I will never give up

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,520
What's going on?

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,080
Is it because she, Haori, is deceiving?

45
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,720
Let me tell you

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,880
If Yuzhi dares to cheat,

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,520
I will

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,920
I'll hit her with this spoon

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,520
I'm so worried about Tong Feng

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,560
As expected of our Jiuyou Tongfeng

51
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,680
Come on, hold on

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,640
Tongfeng, hold on, Tongfeng

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
Tong Feng catches up

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,440
The score gap gradually narrows

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,280
seventeen to twenty

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,280
It’s match point

57
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,920
Haori took the lead to hit the match point

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,600
Tong Feng is already lagging behind Princess Yuzhi by a huge margin

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,320
Tong Feng will wipe away the shame of Chao's life

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,120
Still no miracle happened

61
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,720
Where is the proud Princess Haori who lost to the demon world?

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
seventeen to twenty

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,200
It’s match point

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,000
Haori took the lead to hit the match point

65
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,600
Tong Feng has fallen behind Princess Yuzhi by a huge margin

66
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
Tong Feng will wipe away the shame of his life

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,640
Still no miracle happened

68
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,120
Where is the proud Princess Haori who lost to the demon world?

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,440
It's almost time to reach the match point

70
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,520
You lose by one point

71
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,920
Otherwise, you'd better admit defeat now

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,680
His face is not that ugly

73
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,280
I have been a poor student of Jiuyou for three thousand years

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,320
Finally got a chance to make a comeback

75
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,840
I will never give up

76
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,840
Come on, come on, come on

77
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,520
please

78
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,000
It's getting more and more interesting

79
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,040
Mr. Jiuyou Mansion will end in person

80
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,760
Could it be

81
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,480
Do you think there's anything wrong?

82
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,680
On the field

83
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,200
Using demonic magic openly to hurt people

84
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,960
Every move is fatal

85
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,880
That's enough

86
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,360
I I I don't understand what you are saying

87
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,200
Jiuyou will never allow such things to happen.

88
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,760
The feathers on the badminton come from the feathers of the Yu tribe

89
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Feather tribe can use

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,280
Magic that cannot be seen in other worlds

91
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,280
Just now you turned the badminton ball into several cold knives

92
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,120
The above technique is still in effect

93
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,280
If you don't believe it

94
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
Just ask someone from the Feather Clan to find out.

95
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,240
The situation on the field has now reached

96
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,320
white-hot degree

97
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,280
Our wise and mighty Lord Fu

98
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,880
Got into a fight with the Demon Lord

99
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,440
After all, is it just a matter of anger for beauty?

100
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,680
The cheating behavior of the Demon Princess

101
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,640
I don’t know if it’s true or not

102
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,560
if true

103
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Then Princess Haori

104
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,640
This behavior is a bit despicable.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,720
I'll just say it

106
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,880
She must be cheating on that Haori

107
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,800
Ugly

108
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,480
alright

109
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,960
The princess of the demon clan is eager to win

110
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,440
It’s the nature of a little girl

111
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,840
It's not intentional

112
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,840
Why don't we play a mixed game for men and women in the second half?

113
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
Mr. Fu seems to be preparing

114
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,840
Becoming Miss Tongfeng’s partner

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,520
The prince of the mansion fights with the princess

116
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,600
It is inevitable that there is a suspicion of bullying.

117
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,360
It's better to team up with the Demon Lord and the Princess

118
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,080
This game is evenly matched

119
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,280
Walk

120
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,640
last game

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,920
I'm your teammate

122
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
But I'm afraid of holding you back

123
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,600
This is your game

124
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
Is there anything that can't hold me back?

125
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,640
Sit here first

126
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,480
How's the injury?

127
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,600
Are you okay? Tong Feng

128
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,320
Tongfeng

129
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,480
minor injury

130
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,600
Feeling better?

131
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,960
Don't let me get hurt again in the future.

132
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,200
Just now, I, the Princess of the Demon Realm, used some tricks

133
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,600
Please don't mind, girl

134
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,440
Why does this Demon Lord look like Si Mo?

135
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,480
Hurt my Jiuyou soul

136
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you think a bottle of water can solve the problem?

137
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,080
I just care about Miss Tongfeng

138
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,920
Not allowed?

139
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,640
Fu-kun

140
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,560
If a person in the devil world makes a mistake

141
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,240
I will definitely give Jiuyou an explanation in the future.

142
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,040
But this game

143
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,080
It's between me and the prince

144
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,320
Principal image

145
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,720
must win

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,600
Demon King

147
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,200
Before the game starts

148
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,680
It's better to be cautious in your words and deeds

149
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,840
Fu-kun

150
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,360
please

151
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,640
After the Tongfeng player was injured

152
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,360
Both sides changed their players.

153
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,120
The game starts

154
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,080
As soon as Lord Fu comes on stage

155
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,120
There was a wave of cheers

156
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,920
Look at these beautiful muscle lines

157
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
Look at these women from all walks of life

158
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,520
Crazy handsome face

159
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,560
Look at this unparalleled jumping ability

160
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,640
Look at this breathtakingly handsome guy

161
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,480
catching action

162
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,960
Beauty and strength coexist

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,680
Is the most powerful idol group

164
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
He is the most handsome and capable guy

165
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,480
Player Tong Feng has also recovered his form

166
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,720
The Demon Lord’s strength should not be underestimated either.

167
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,400
Actually and Mr. Fujun

168
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
It's hard to tell the difference between them

169
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,040
this game

170
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,080
It's not just

171
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,840
The battle between Tong Feng and the Demon Realm Princess

172
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,120
There is already a faint demon world

173
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,600
The war with Jiuyou

174
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,120
Mr. Fujun, come on, Mr. Fujun.

175
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,840
Come on Tongfeng, Tongfeng

176
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,800
The scores of both sides alternately lead

177
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,360
It feels like I’ve reached the match point in one breath

178
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,720
Wonderful, really wonderful

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,040
It is indeed a duel between Lord Fu and Demon Lord.

180
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
The pace is terrifyingly fast

181
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,160
Who will be the final winner?

182
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,760
Let us wait and see

183
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,600
Wait and see

184
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,840
Wonderful

185
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,080
It's so wonderful

186
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,560
Twenty-nine versus twenty-nine

187
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,840
The score was evened again

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,720
It is indeed a duel between Fujun and Demon Lord.

189
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,440
It's so wonderful

190
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
The intensity of this game

191
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,200
It has reached an unimaginable level

192
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,720
game over

193
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,960
Jiuyou wins

194
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,160
won

195
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,880
This game is so beautiful

196
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,920
At the end of the final match

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,880
Win the final

198
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,960
This is a competition between endurance and mentality.

199
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,000
This can be recorded in badminton history

200
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,160
badminton match

201
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,560
I feel like I'm going to cry

202
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,280
Watching Tong Feng walking step by step

203
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,840
It's really not easy

204
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,960
The winner of the preliminary rounds of the Three Worlds Talent Competition has emerged

205
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
That’s our Tongfeng

206
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,160
That's it

207
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,960
This is how it feels when your daughter gets married, right?

208
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,800
Tong Feng doesn’t want to be your daughter.

209
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,720
Children can be taught

210
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
we all know

211
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Tong Feng is the most ignorant student in Jiuyou.

212
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,000
But today

213
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,000
She changed her ways

214
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,040
Turn around and find the shore

215
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,920
Let us give you the warmest applause

216
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
Let’s wish this thousand-year bottom king together

217
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,880
Her success tells us

218
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,640
Just work hard

219
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
will create miracles

220
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
Miracle

221
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,400
alright

222
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,920
The coronation ceremony has been completed

223
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,720
I think everyone is interested in the prize for the champion

224
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,560
All curious

225
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,000
Now I will be the champion of this preliminary round

226
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,840
Awards

227
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,080
Dream lottery jackpot

228
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,640
Now we invite the winner of this preliminary competition

229
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,400
Tong Feng gave an acceptance speech

230
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,760
Thanks to the organizer

231
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,240
Thanks to the judges

232
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,000
this champion

233
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,320
When giving an acceptance speech

234
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,720
Don’t look at the cheat sheet in the palm of your hand

235
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,200
In fact, that part just now

236
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,960
I copied it from the Internet

237
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,400
What about me?

238
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,840
He is a soul who has never won an award

239
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,960
so i don't know

240
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,560
What should I say in my acceptance speech?

241
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,560
But if you want to thank

242
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,400
I want to thank someone

243
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,680
He has been with me for three thousand years

244
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,400
Teach me the principles of magic

245
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,440
And cook for me every day

246
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,400
In the past when I was ridiculous

247
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,720
He always covers me

248
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,680
Later I practiced hard

249
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
He urged me to study

250
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,360
I used to think about it all the time

251
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,680
Is everyone as lucky as me?

252
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,600
Later I found out

253
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,520
My luck

254
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,600
Just like a mortal won the lottery

255
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,560
Scaryly rare

256
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,760
How lucky

257
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,440
Thank you

258
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,760
Have been by my side for so many years

259
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,480
May the years to come be

260
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,920
See you every year

261
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,160
good

262
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,480
Won first place

263
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,200
take you to a good place

264
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,960
where

265
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,840
You'll know when you go there

266
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,760
won the championship

267
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,880
It’s natural to celebrate happily

268
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,680
Si Mo

269
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,360
Will you follow me back to the devil world?

270
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,400
Not yet

271
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,200
I still have important tasks in Jiuyou

272
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,200
What other tasks do you have?

273
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,200
you saw

274
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,800
That woman is obviously Xuan Pei's

275
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,680
Shut up

276
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,000
You won't forget the purpose of coming here, right?

277
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,360
You're not here for that woman

278
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
how do i do things

279
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,240
I don’t need you to teach me

280
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,800
I

281
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,560
How can it be so similar?

282
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,440
How could it be?

283
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,880
God, who are you talking about?

284
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,880
My best friend is also a god in the world

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,320
She is extremely kind

286
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,040
Also extremely terrifying

287
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,680
She has been burdened with many

288
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,720
Her name is Jun Wei

289
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,080
She is also called Blood Demon
