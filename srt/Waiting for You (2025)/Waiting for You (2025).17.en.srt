1
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,880
Xuan Pei

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,200
What day is today

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,480
Why did you cook so many dishes?

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,880
Tomorrow is the preliminary round of the Three Worlds Talent Competition

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,520
Then you are doing it because I have to compete tomorrow

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,080
So is it specially made for me?

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,600
These

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,560
But they are all your favorite food

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,520
tasty

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,360
I love eating it so much

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,880
Slower

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,800
Don't choke

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,160
Xuan Pei

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,320
Do you think I will win tomorrow?

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,440
Your intelligence, charm and force

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,360
All have passed

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
Definitely can enter the semi-finals

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,080
But I think first

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,280
I can only be sure that you can enter the semi-finals

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,360
But can I get first place?

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,320
It all depends on your opponent and your luck.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,040
I've worked hard for so long

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,440
Can you get the lottery jackpot?

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,680
Isn’t it still an unknown quantity?

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,040
anyway

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,120
I will be with you tomorrow

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,760
Don't worry

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,800
Eat your food first

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,520
Slower

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,160
Time flies like water

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,280
we walked together

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,480
flowers bloom and fall

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,640
we come all the way

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,360
excited heart

35
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,160
trembling hands

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,080
On this day when the three worlds gather together

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,440
I solemnly announce

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,600
The Three Realms Talent Competition officially kicked off

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,440
Let us welcome you with a warm round of applause

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,760
Mr. Jiuyoufu

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,160
Emperor of Heaven

42
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Demon King

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,920
Admission

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,040
Doesn’t Xuan Pei usually sit in the middle?

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,840
Why are you sitting on the left today?

46
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,360
You don't even know this

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
It's up to me, Jiuyou Know-It-All, to tell you.

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,400
Let me tell you about the war between gods and demons four thousand years ago

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,600
Lord Jiuyoufu and Demon Lord died together

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,560
So they jointly chose a new king

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,760
The Emperor of Heaven is the first king

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,160
To show respect for her

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
So her identity?

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,480
Slightly higher than Fujun and Demon Lord

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,520
Of course, sit in the middle

56
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,680
But why doesn’t the Demon Lord show his true face to others today?

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,800
wearing a mask

58
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,640
I ate some food that I was allergic to some time ago.

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
There is some rash on the face

60
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,600
Demon Lord really pays attention to his image

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
This emperor of heaven is very handsome.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,440
But this Demon Lord is strange

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
wearing a mask

64
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Don’t show your true colors to others

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
Maybe all big names are like this

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
The scale of today’s event

67
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,960
It's unprecedentedly grand

68
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,600
before the game officially starts

69
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,600
Let me tell you the rules of the competition

70
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,320
race first

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,960
Contestants’ qualifications

72
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Carry out inspection

73
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,000
Nine Nether Souls

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
Check whether his intelligence, charm and force are up to standard

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,920
The Heavenly Realm Representative Team and the Demon Realm Representative Team

76
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,240
Then check whether his cultivation level is qualified

77
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,960
If you pass, you will enter the official competition.

78
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,080
official game

79
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,000
The contents of the competition will be determined by drawing lots by the underworld

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,320
What about the soul named Tong Feng?

81
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
Start broadcasting now that Jiuyou’s numerical value has reached the standard

82
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,760
Stop smoking. Stop smoking.

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,960
Show it to Tong Feng quickly

84
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,560
The preliminary list will be out soon

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,040
Walk-behind tractor

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,640
Sakurako Uesugi

87
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,320
Park Hye-hye

88
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,880
Tongfeng

89
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,480
Zhang Xiaohong

90
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,720
Wang Xiaoming

91
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,320
Maimaiti

92
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't get excited

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,000
This is Tong Feng’s normal operation

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,880
that is

95
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,240
Let the people from the demon world and heaven see it

96
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,480
Isn’t the style of our Jiuyou

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,640
Yes that is

98
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,760
Haori

99
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,200
Princess

100
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,280
You entered the competition

101
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,320
So awesome

102
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,120
I heard a familiar name

103
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,400
Never mind

104
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,680
Three Realms Talent Competition

105
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,440
What is often compared is magic and force.

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,680
The sword has no eyes

107
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,880
Spells are ruthless

108
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,520
There will be casualties in every game

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,400
I couldn't let that damn girl die in my hands last time

110
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,560
This time I want her to be in front of everyone

111
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,240
Died tragically in my hands

112
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Princess, the king's side

113
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,680
Si Mo knows

114
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,560
Will definitely stop me again

115
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,440
Let's kill that damn girl first and then talk about it

116
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,640
yes

117
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,040
After a long review

118
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Qualified contestants have been selected

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,560
Players prepare in the player area

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,240
Now

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,600
Please invite the underworld to draw lots to decide the content of the competition.

122
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,760
please

123
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,640
Thanks to the underworld

124
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,520
Pluto, please come this way

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,520
The content of this year’s competition is really unexpected

126
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,240
For thousands of years

127
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
There has never been such a competition before

128
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,560
This year’s competition is

129
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,200
badminton

130
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,960
What

131
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,960
badminton

132
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,080
This year

133
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,800
fine

134
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,840
Quite unexpected

135
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,000
Unbelievable

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
It’s actually badminton

137
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,240
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

138
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,600
How unreasonable

139
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,920
Jiuyou is really hateful

140
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,960
worse than anything

141
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Must compare with badminton

142
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,040
The princess is obviously most afraid of badminton.

143
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,360
This badminton feather

144
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,200
They were all plucked from the princess and your clan.

145
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,840
Shut up

146
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Princess, are you still competing?

147
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,480
Compare

148
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,640
Why not compare?

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,600
No

150
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,920
Badminton

151
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,280
But the princess

152
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,600
you don't want to

153
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,560
Even badminton

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,040
I can also let that girl die in my hands

155
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,720
This competition is for mixed men and women.

156
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,920
Form your own team

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,840
Princess

158
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,080
You see who you want to team up with

159
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,920
Go and call Bo Ye

160
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,600
He is the best badminton player among the men in the demon world

161
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,680
yes

162
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,880
After the contestants formed their own teams

163
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,840
Our duel list

164
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,000

165

All will be explained by professionals

175
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,160
A wonderful explanation of Seduction and Death

176

Please pretend not to see it

183
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,360
Thanks

184
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,160
Please stop advertising

185
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,520
And I'm not your agent.

186
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,800
The scorer for this competition will be Ming Xiang.

187
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,520
The referees are three guests

188
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,000
Now it is up to this judge to announce

189
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,320
The rules of this badminton competition

190
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,360
The game is a best-of-three game

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,960
The first to reach twenty-one points in each game wins

192
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
Did everyone understand?

193
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,960
Didn't understand something

194
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,760
Kyuubi will be sad

195
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,960
goblin

196
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,640
Let us applaud the first group of contestants

197
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,120
Haori Hakuha, Zhang Xiaohong and Mike appear

198
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,440
Applause is invited

199
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,960
The game starts

200
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,000
Zhang Xiaohong and Mike

201
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,320
He is a veteran of the Jiuyouyu team.

202
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,600
He was a member of the badminton team during his lifetime

203
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,960
They have won many gold medals

204
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Speed ​​and strength are both top-notch

205
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,880
Princess Haori of the Demon Clan should not be underestimated either.

206
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,320
Her partner is still a demon

207
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Badminton champion Bo Ye

208
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,440
This is for both parties

209
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,520
It's all a tough battle.

210
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
Mike Yiji's forehand hook

211
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,120
pretty

212
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,920
This serve

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,560
pretty

214
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,440
A smash from Haori

215
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,760
Ended the first game

216
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,560
The devil wins

217
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,800
Tongfeng

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,160
Thank you for letting me partner with you

219
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
Look at that Haori

220
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,680
The second game begins

221
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,440
What's the matter

222
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,080
She looks pretty

223
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,440
really

224
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Very pretty and lovely

225
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,040
Didn’t I secretly go to the devil world?

226
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,320
She's the one who kidnapped me

227
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,560
Still want to burn me with fire

228
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,040
What

229
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
I saw it right

230
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,520
ugly looking

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,440
Face comes from heart

232
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,200
really

233
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,920
Ugly

234
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,800
Ugly

235
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,360
There is really no suspense about this game.

236
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,000
Haori scored consecutive spikes

237
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
The score advantage gradually widens

238
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,360
Quite exciting

239
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
The demons came to the match point first again

240
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,560
Let's compete in a while

241
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,800
It's very possible to meet her

242
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,640
She looks like a professional at badminton

243
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,440
Tongfeng

244
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,440
you believe me

245
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,720
I play badminton

246
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
Although it is not said to be particularly powerful

247
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,840
But I am also known as the Prince of Jiuyou Badminton

248
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,400
These stinky fish and shrimps

249
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,640
Not my opponent at all

250
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,480
Fuck with me

251
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,160
take you to fly

252
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,760
Teach them a lesson in a while

253
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,760
let them know

254
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,120
Jiuyou Little Overlord Tong Feng

255
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,640
It's not something they can bully casually

256
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,160
right

257
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,800
Haori and Hakuba lead with a big score of 2-0.

258
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,640
Be the first to qualify for the semi-finals

259
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,080
I would also like to thank the family of Princess Hazhi here.

260
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,880
Without the Yu tribe, there would be no badminton.

261
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,880
The player entering now is Jiuyou player

262
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
Tong Feng and Li Dafu

263
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,520
Look at their extraordinary figures

264
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,520
tall body

265
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,480
Strong skills

266
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,480
I think the champion player must be them.

267
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,840
Although these two are Jiuyou players

268
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,240
But I still want to say something to them

269
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,800
you are my pride

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,920
The game starts

271
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,480
Walk-behind tractor

272
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
This is a beautiful smash

273
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,040
Killed the opponent directly

274
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
Worthy of being a fighting nation in heaven

275
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,880
Hard to pronounce except the name

276
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,720
This plan can be said to have no shortcomings

277
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,240
What happened to the Jiuyou players?

278
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,080
Li Dafu

279
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,040
cheer up

280
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,520
Li Dafu

281
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,920
This is what you said, take me flying

282
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,720
As expected, it is better to ask for yourself than to ask for others.

283
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,120
good guy

284
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
Young general Tong Feng appears

285
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,800
She is like a lion that just woke up from its slumber

286
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
nice bounce

287
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,680
Nice boost

288
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,800
nice shot

289
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
Well played Well played

290
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,240
How could the Emperor be so rude when he saw Tong Feng?

291
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,680
I’ve watched the game for so long

292
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,840
Presumably the Emperor of Heaven must also be thirsty

293
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,320
This is the most beloved wine among mortals

294
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,400
We sincerely invite the Emperor of Heaven and the Demon Lord to have a drink together

295
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800
This little girl is the same

296
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,440
The one who went to the devil's world with you privately?

297
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,360
I remember her name

298
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,920
Tongfeng

299
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,800
Yes or no

300
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,000
Nine Nether Souls

301
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,000
Inadvertently broke into the devil world

302
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,080
Already punished

303
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
There is no need for the Emperor of Heaven

304
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,080
Remember the name of a little soul

305
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,360
I see this little girl

306
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,600
Not just a little soul

307
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,760
He is also a master at playing badminton.

308
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,800
Demon King

309
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,080
What do you say?

310
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,360
Miss Tongfeng’s ball skills are really good

311
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,520
Tong Feng and Li Dafu scored two to one

312
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,000
gain victory

313
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,520
Qualified for the semi-finals

314
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,400
Li Dafu

315
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,840
Aren’t you the little badminton prince?

316
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,360
This is your strength

317
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,080
yes

318
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,600
Didn’t we win?

319
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,080
you

320
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,320
That's based on the fact that your teammates are almost exhausted

321
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,720
One is fighting

322
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,840
One is based on watching a play

323
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,200
Tongfeng

324
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,840
I used to fight with children all the time

325
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,760
I thought this was a ball game

326
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,520
Almost the same

327
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,280
It's a back-and-forth call, right?

328
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,800
you

329
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,640
I didn’t expect it to be a bit difficult.

330
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,400
Now only we and Haori's group are left.

331
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,280
Haori's strength far exceeds

332
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,320
On top of the groups of people we just saw

333
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,760
Tongfeng

334
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,080
Seriously

335
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,600
How about you ask Meng Dihua to form a team with you?

336
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,040
She fought so well

337
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,640
I will only hold you back

338
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,080
Don’t you think first?

339
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,640
Yes or no

340
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,520
This is not good, right?

341
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
When did this happen?

342
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,360
You still care about my emotions

343
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,280
Am I, Li Dafu, that kind of person?

344
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,320
Do you think so?

345
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,000
not me

346
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
I'll find Meng Dihua for you right now

347
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,840
you got first

348
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,440
Your brother, I also have light on my face, right?

349
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,360
Stop talking

350
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,120
That's it

351
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
I'll go find her for you. Wait for me.

352
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,120
Li Dafu

353
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,680
I mean

354
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,320
Call Ma Yichun over

355
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,960
This is a mixed doubles match

356
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,920
Xiao Mencius, she is a girl

357
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,520
Today's game is really exciting

358
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,320
In this wonderful competition we welcome

359
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,400
The ultimate ultimate event

360
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,000
Jiuyou Tongfeng fights against Princess Yuzhi of the Demon Realm

361
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,680
what to do

362
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,440
The audience in front of the screen should not go away

363
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
The exciting game is about to begin

364
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,760
Where did Li Dafu go?

365
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,440
Even Ma Yichun can't be called over by me.

366
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,560
He himself has to come back

367
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,520
This is not the last time

368
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,280
The nine ghost souls that broke into the demon world?

369
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,200
you are not dead yet

370
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,320
Isn’t this Princess Mao Zhi?

371
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,880
You'd better care more about yourself

372
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,200
Last time you were knocked to the ground by Xuan Pei and vomited blood.

373
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,560
Did you see a doctor when you went back?

374
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,520
you

375
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,800
Since your teammates are not here

376
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,280
Why don't you just admit defeat?

377
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,320
I can still save you some dignity

378
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,320
Since coming here

379
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,600
Will never give up without a fight

380
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,760
OK

381
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,200
Then let’s get started

382
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,320
thin leaves

383
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,240
You step back first

384
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,440
The game starts

385
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,560
Brother Bo Ye didn't take action

386
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,720
This game became

387
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,560
The duel between the two female generals Tong Feng and Yu Zhi

388
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,160
The two female players can't wait

389
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,560
Princess Yuzhi’s offensive is very fierce

390
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,560
Tong Feng is a slow player

391
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,000
I don’t know if I can handle it.

392
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,120
Tong Feng can no longer be called a young general

393
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Such a skillful technique

394
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,080
Attack your opponent with precision and ruthlessness

395
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,200
He is already an excellent veteran.

396
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,440
End of the first game

397
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,760
Tong Feng wins

398
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
In the first game, Jiuyou player Tong Feng

399
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,040
Winner

400
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,640
Sure enough, it was her that I was looking at

401
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,960
She feels something is wrong

402
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,200
If Tong Feng wins again in the second game

403
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,080
Then the winner of the preliminary round of this talent competition

404
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,080
It’s Jiuyou Tongfeng

405
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,240
This damn girl actually has two brushes

406
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
If this continues

407
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,760
I might lose

408
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,360
The game starts

409
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,800
The second game just started

410
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,640
Princess Haori took the lead to score a point
