1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,960
The fantasyland I went to before

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,480
what is

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,680
It's a script that has already been written

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,560
The script turns into a fantasy

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,880
The living soul escapes into the fantasy world

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,160
After completing the script that has been written for a long time

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
will return to Jiuyou

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,320
This is the truth about cultivation and graduation

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,520
Established script

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,120
Just like Lin Qing

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,840
His original script was to become a warlord

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
But he had no choice

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,320
In fact, he can choose

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,400
Wang Ruonian

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,840
He can choose not to hurt Xu Jing

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,280
But he still chose to hurt

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,400
Everyone's life turning point

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,080
There will be countless choices

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,080
And these choices

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,960
It’s all based on your own will

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,880
The soul in the soul-chasing forest

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,320
That’s because I’ve noticed the illusion of cultivation.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,280
Don't want to enter the fantasy world

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
Then they all hid in the Soul-Chasing Forest.

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,560
I secretly arranged for the underworld to go and collect the souls

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,360
I just want to protect their souls

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,800
But who would have thought

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,320
It takes too much spiritual power to create false illusions

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,760
After all, I'm still a little behind

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,480
Xuan Pei

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,480
these years

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,640
how did you get here

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,160
You have protected Jiuyou for a hundred thousand years

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,160
I can't protect the world

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
But this Jiuyou

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,120
I must keep it

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,880
You told me before that you longed for reincarnation

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
I want to live my life like ordinary people

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,960
Parting between life and death

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,360
Experience the sweetness and bitterness of the world

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,080
you say

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,480
It doesn't matter if it's more painful

43
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,120
Because life is always more sweet than bitter

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,800
But now Xiuweijing has become an illusion

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,080
I don't know how to face you

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,560
I don’t know how to mention it to you

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,240
What are you talking about? How could I blame you?

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,520
Besides, you and I join forces

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,840
we will find it

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,880
Isn't that the way to restart the mortal world?

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,240
yes

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,640
We will definitely restart the mortal world

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,880
You are here

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,080
Xuan Pei and I made these delicacies together

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,400
You don't have to be polite, just enjoy it

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,840
This is where I started to show off.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, Tong Feng

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,880
No matter what, I am also your fantasy couple

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,880
you have to relax

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
Now I have come out of the illusion

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,280
Tongfeng

62
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,480
Today, Simo and I

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,840
I'm getting ready to go back to the devil world.

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,120
I will work with him to manage the demon world well.

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,800
yes

66
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,560
Tong Feng remember what I told you

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,520
The devil world will always be your home

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,560
Then I won’t give it away

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,040
It’s time for us to return to heaven

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,600
What are your plans next?

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,440
Pluto

72
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,880
I’ll leave Jiuyou’s affairs to you.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,240
My wife and I

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,200
Get ready to go out for a walk

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,320
Your Majesty

76
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,680
We are going on honeymoon together

77
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,720
Xuan Pei, you play really well

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,720
If we don’t become kings anymore

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,560
You can also open a hair salon

80
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,160
That's your skill

81
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,960
He can kill 80% of the barber guys instantly.

82
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,120
How is that possible

83
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,760
I will only blow for you in this life

84
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:47,960
I

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,720
Come, come, come closer, come closer

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,320
Right, right, right

87
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
Taigong Liu is going to be so angry

88
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,800
He said that we are all the princes of Jiuyou

89
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,400
You can't be so ignorant of etiquette

90
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
What about etiquette?

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
This is the shackles that the world puts on you

92
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,480
no need to follow

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,120
The soul of Taigong Liu is really too old-fashioned.

94
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,480
Over the years, he has been targeting Kyuubi-sensei

95
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,920
Are you trying to target Kyuubi-sensei?

96
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Still want to attract Kyuubi's attention

97
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
He must not be able to tell the difference himself.

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,720
Isn’t there a light bulb in this world?

99
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,200
Why is there a candlelight dinner?

100
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,720
because of this

101
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
We can see each other's faces clearly

102
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
This flower is

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,800
Just for you

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,640
let's go

105
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,240
we are not

106
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,320
It's not that I went wrong here

107
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,000
This is it

108
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,400
If I say no, it’s not

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,960
Good or not

110
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,200
Didn't we agree to watch the sunrise together?

111
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,360
Why are you still sleeping in?

112
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,720
Don't think of it

113
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,200
Xuan Pei

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,960
can you cast a spell

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,800
Make the room darker so I can sleep a little longer

116
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,800
little slacker

117
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,080
Xuan Pei

118
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,520
The scenery is beautiful today

119
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
As long as you like it

120
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,000
When you are the ruler of the house, you get up at Mao hour every day.

121
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,800
It's already time

122
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,520
An hour late

123
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,760
It's two hours

124
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,400
I'm making no progress in math

125
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,120
They must know it's because I slept in

126
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,240
So embarrassing

127
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,840
Something embarrassing for both of us

128
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,480
Not just these one or two pieces

129
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,480
Yes

130
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,040
We are princes

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Even if they have an opinion, they can't say anything.

132
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,320
Demonic world, heavenly world

133
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
Listen carefully

134
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,480
Xuan Pei and I have officially announced our marriage.

135
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,600
No one can change it today

136
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,400
Neither will the future

137
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,320
Look, look, look

138
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,880
Master and Tong Feng's Secret Records of Nine Netherworlds

139
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,640
Today I saw the scenery with my husband

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,240
The scenery is so beautiful

141
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,400
Lianhua, isn’t this the Secret Record of the Nine Netherworlds?

142
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,400
Why are you here too?

143
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,800
Emperor Meng Dihua is the emperor of heaven

144
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
I can have whatever I want

145
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,280
Last time I took pictures with Xiao Tongfeng

146
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,040
It feels like it was a long time ago

147
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,640
Tianxuan's comment has been deleted by Xuan Pei

148
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,160
What is there to see at sunrise?

149
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,720
Hyun Bae is so uncreative

150
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,320
Si Mo's comment has been deleted by Xuan Pei

151
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,560
Xuan Pei

152
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,960
What do you think is the difference between sunrise and sunset?

153
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,040
at sunrise

154
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
All things are reborn

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
at sunset

156
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,560
Everything is lonely

157
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,320
Tongfeng

158
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,560
You know I'm dying, right?

159
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,680
yes

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,880
Four thousand years ago you died in Jiuyou

161
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,640
How could I just let you go?

162
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,320
Whether it's going against the will of heaven and changing one's destiny, it's okay to go against the grain and go against the grain.

163
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,520
I just want you to live

164
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,840
When I learned about the art of reshaping the divine body

165
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,720
The price for resurrecting you is to let me die

166
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,200
At that moment I was hesitant

167
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,520
I'm afraid you'll hate me

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,920
I can't stay with you forever

169
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,560
But still doing it

170
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,280
catch you thing

171
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,240
If you don't catch me

172
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,400
I will hate you

173
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,240
i will be there

174
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,360
Thousands of years

175
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,680
Found another little black cat

176
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,200
in this world

177
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,280
Where are there so many little black cats?

178
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,440
only me

179
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,640
The only little black cat in the world

180
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,520
Willing to wait for you forever

181
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,440
my lady

182
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,960
Just a few decades for mortals

183
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,520
Can seize the time

184
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,120
Chasing beauty

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,040
why we

186
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,720
Why don't you seize the last moment?

187
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,600
During these three thousand years

188
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,680
I'm scared every day

189
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,000
as time goes on

190
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm getting weaker and weaker

191
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
To protect you from wind and rain

192
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,600
After returning from the illusion

193
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,560
I knew it

194
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,440
The time has come

195
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,320
That's why I secretly arranged the Pluto phase

196
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,840
Helped you retrieve your memory

197
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,960
why do you

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,840
Don't wake up my memory by yourself

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,080
Because I'm afraid

200
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,120
four thousand years ago

201
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
that scene

202
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,920
It's still in front of me now

203
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,480
Because I'm afraid you know I resurrected you

204
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,360
But I left you first

205
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm afraid this is an unchangeable fate

206
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,360
before

207
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,720
I want to be by your side every moment

208
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,240
It's a pity that I can't seize the time

209
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,440
Nor can I control this so-called destiny

210
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,400
time

211
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,960
Not much left

212
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,520
What's going on? What's going on? This is

213
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,120
adult

214
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,920
Grandpa, this

215
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,040
Xuan Pei

216
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,920
Why did she leave?

217
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,880
what should we do

218
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,000
What happened to us just now?

219
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,080
Sir, something happened over there. Let's go check it out.

220
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,080
wrong

221
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,760
Jiuyou's breath disappeared

222
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,400
Nothing happened to Jiuyou

223
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,040
Grandpa, this

224
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,520
Why did it open again?

225
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,280
adult

226
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,040
adult
