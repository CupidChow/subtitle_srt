1
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,720
These two people are quite interested.

2
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,400
Let's go, let's go, let's go

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,560
adult

4
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,960
The subordinates respectfully welcome Mr. Fu back to Jiuyou.

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,320
We sincerely welcome Mr. Fu to return to Jiuyou.

6
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,160
Free of charge

7
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,800
we are back

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,040
What should Lin Qing and the others do?

9
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,400
Wanwan saved us

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,480
We have to go back to save Wanwan

11
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,720
Not urgent

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,520
Wanwan's mother has passed away

13
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,160
At this moment, I am in Jiuyou

14
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Just find her

15
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,440
Ask for the ins and outs

16
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,960
Then you can know where Lin Qing’s heart is.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,760
Xu Jing was born in the first year of the Republic of China

18
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,120
Died in the 28th year of the Republic of China

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,000
hanged himself to death

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,480
Never do any evil in your life

21
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
But the resentment is deep

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,680
adult

23
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,720
The subordinates have found Wanwan’s biological mother

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,760
Where is Xu Jing’s soul?

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,560
But Xu Jing’s resentment was too deep

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,880
About to fall into the realm of evil spirits

27
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,400
But the consciousness is still clear for now

28
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,960
Do you still want to summon me?

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,080
Once you fall into the realm of evil spirits

30
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,680
Wouldn't that mean you have to suffer the punishment of having your soul broken and your spirit broken?

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,880
Bring Xu Jing here

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
yes

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,360
This person was born in the first year of the Republic of China

34
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,440
Xu Jing died in the 28th year of the Republic of China

35
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,080
yes

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
Xu Jing, do you know Lin Qing?

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,120
Lin Qing

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
He is a driver of my husband Wang Ruonian

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm not familiar with him

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,000
But he is an honest man

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,080
One spring

42
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,320
He also gave me a special pot of flowers

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,720
What to spend

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,440
The flower pot is divided into two

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,800
A few plum blossoms are inserted on the left

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,480
There are a few pear blossoms inserted on the right side

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,400
These two flowers are not in the same season

48
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,400
But I don’t know how he did it

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,480
Two kinds of flowers

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
bloomed in the same flowerpot

51
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,320
Xu Jing, do you still remember your daughter?

52
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
daughter

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,320
She must have been killed by her father

54
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,640
Kill it

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,040
No, that's not her father

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,640
She is a bastard

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,920
She has no father

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,880
What

59
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,800
She has no father

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,440
She has no father

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,280
Xu Jing, we saw your daughter in the fantasy world

62
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,800
she's alive and she's bubbly

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,560
Lin Qing is raising her

64
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,120
But they were hunted down in the fantasy world

65
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,360
Can you share your life experience

66
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,200
tell us

67
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,120
we want to help her

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,560
You mean my daughter is still alive

69
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,360
yes

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,040
I was originally the daughter of a poor family

71
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,160
But my parents are very good to me

72
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,000
They sold their family land so that I could go to school

73
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,000
I hope one day I can marry into a good family

74
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
That day on the way to school

75
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,440
I met Ning Cheng

76
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,120
The richest young master of the Wang family

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,480
Wang Ruonian

78
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,640
We've only known each other for a few days

79
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,120
He proposed to me

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,640
I thought I had the most beautiful dream

81
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,160
Didn't expect

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,880
In this world

83
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
worst nightmare

84
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
Wang Ruonian is nothing but a beast

85
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,160
He didn't marry me because he loved me

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,600
But to cover up a secret

87
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,600
he never touched me

88
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,040
But torturing me night after night

89
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,240
Then I gave birth to my daughter

90
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,960
since then

91
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,360
Wang Ruonian tortured me even more

92
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,400
Beat me up

93
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm desperate

94
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,120
He hanged himself to death

95
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,520
Died in the 28th year of the Republic of China

96
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,280
in this world

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,480
How could there be such a cold-blooded person?

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
You help me kill Wang Ruonian

99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,360
Kill Wang Ruonian

100
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,440
Calm down, calm down

101
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,680
Xuan Pei

102
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
I think

103
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,840
Xu Jing

104
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,120
Hiding something from us

105
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,680
She said Wanwan was not Wang Ruonian's child

106
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,280
Whose child could that be?

107
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
The truth Xu Jing concealed

108
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,880
That's the reason for her deep resentment

109
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,880
The last time we talked to Lin Qing,

110
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,680
He hid part of the truth

111
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,520
this matter

112
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
This is where Lin Qing’s heart knot lies.

113
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,040
as well as

114
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
The crux of Xu Jing’s resentment

115
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,400
Since Xuan Pei is like this

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,880
Then let’s go to the fantasy land quickly

117
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,280
know all the truth

118
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
Only in this way can Wanwan, Xu Jing and Lin Qing be rescued.

119
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
This time we go to fantasyland

120
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Spells will not be sealed

121
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,320
Remember not to harm mortals

122
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,760
If you accidentally hurt a mortal

123
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
After returning to Jiuyou

124
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
According to the "Nine Nether Laws and Orders"

125
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,760
Will be severely punished

126
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,000
Xuan Pei, who can I hurt?

127
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,560
you think too much

128
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,360
I'm just afraid

129
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,640
The final truth will make you unable to control yourself

130
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
make big mistake

131
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,240
What kind of place is this Paramount?

132
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,760
Will Wang Ruonian really come?

133
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,240
Hello, Master Wang. Hello, Master Wang.

134
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,280
Please use it slowly

135
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,600
It turns out that this is Wang Ruonian

136
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
I wonder if Lin Qing will take action tonight

137
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,480
Everyone

138
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,200
Tonight is Paramount's number one

139
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,200
Miss Peony performs on stage for the last time

140
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,480
next month

141
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,360
She will be Miss Peony

142
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,120
and chamber of commerce president

143
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,040
The eldest young master of the Wang family is newly married

144
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,320
Congratulations, Master Wang. Congratulations.

145
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,040
here

146
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,120
We congratulate you both

147
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
Congratulations, Mr. Wang, congratulations

148
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,400
Please enjoy

149
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,840
All spending tonight

150
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,520
Mr. Wang pays the bill

151
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,480
Thank you very much, Mr. Wang

152
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,920
Let's play

153
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,200
are you okay

154
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,480
Lin Qing

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
Ruonian, please help me

156
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,840
it's you

157
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
Didn't expect it

158
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,520
You forced the eldest young lady to death

159
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,640
I tried my best to save the lady

160
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,680
Then you will kill us all

161
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,280
But we have survived until now

162
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,400
I don't know what you are talking about

163
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,240
you do not know

164
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,920
Wang Ruonian

165
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,760
Today your false image of a good person comes to an end.

166
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,320
Go to the police station and turn yourself in

167
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,320
Welcoming the eldest lady back to the Wang family

168
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,600
I'll leave this bitch's body intact

169
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,960
Lin Qing

170
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,680
my ex-wife

171
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,800
After giving birth to my daughter before my death

172
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,880
My daughter died soon after

173
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,280
Our Wang family

174
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,120
There has never been a living eldest lady

175
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,040
You are a driver

176
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,280
Use this method to cheat money

177
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,440
So despicable

178
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,960
I'm ashamed of you for what you said.

179
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,520
I already guessed that you would say this

180
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,880
I'm a driver

181
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,280
what i said

182
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,760
Maybe everyone can't believe it

183
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,160
But what about her

184
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,680
She's going to become Mrs. Wang, right?

185
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,720
Ruonian save me

186
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,080
Did Wang Ruonian force the eldest mistress to death?

187
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,280
You say it

188
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,720
Wang Ruonian

189
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,720
I really overestimated you

190
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,080
You have no humanity at all

191
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,040
continue

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,880
You don't understand what love is at all

193
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,840
The one you love is not Xu Jing

194
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,840
I pity you

195
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,040
You are a coward, shut up

196
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,600
Hyun-bae Hyun-bae

197
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,160
We cannot change the fate of mortals

198
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,960
shut up

199
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,120
Chase me

200
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,040
it's you

201
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,600
Let's go

202
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Do you want to bring down Wang Ruonian?

203
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
But you are so reckless

204
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,800
Even if one life is exchanged for another

205
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,920
Can't bring him down

206
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,760
what can i do

207
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,640
I have tuberculosis

208
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,280
dying

209
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,920
If I didn't do this

210
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,960
How to avenge the eldest mistress?

211
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,920
How does Wanwan live?

212
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,040
We know Xu Jing

213
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,880
But you have to tell the truth

214
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,640
tell us

215
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Otherwise, how can we help you?

216
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,560
eldest mistress

217
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,800
I was an ordinary driver in Wangfu

218
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Because I have always been unwilling

219
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,920
Flattery to the housekeeper

220
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,640
So he became the sand in the butler's eyes.

221
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,120
The housekeeper always looks for opportunities to beat me

222
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,160
until one day

223
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,800
Young lady reading in the garden

224
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
Saw me being bullied by the housekeeper

225
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,200
stop

226
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,720
Scolded the housekeeper

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,120
Okay, let's go

228
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,240
Go, go, go

229
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,440
are you okay

230
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,960
from that moment on

231
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,600
She is the only light in my miserable life

232
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,280
That spring

233
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,760
I gave you a pot that was half filled with plum blossoms.

234
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,840
A flower arrangement half made of pear blossoms for the eldest mistress

235
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,440
That's the only poem I learned

236
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,520
Plum blossoms, snow pear, flowers and moon always love me

237
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,960
I know she likes plum blossoms the most

238
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,360
The third year after the death of the eldest young lady

239
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,880
Six-year-old Wanwan and me

240
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,280
I accidentally heard Wang Ruonian’s secret

241
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,160
Your cheap daughter is already six years old

242
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,720
You haven't renewed your string yet

243
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,880
Then it's time for someone to gossip about you again

244
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,680
marry her back

245
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,040
She is also looking for someone to have sex with her

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,920
Take it easy for a while

247
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,280
Wang Ruonian started to kill us

248
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Only then did I know

249
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,720
The three years that the eldest young lady married Wang Ruonian

250
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,320
What was it like?

251
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,280
A hellish life on earth

252
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,600
come on you

253
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,720
Wang Ruonian wants a child

254
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,680
to quell the rumors outside

255
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,960
So every night

256
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,040
Don't come over

257
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,400
They all found a different man to rape the young mistress.

258
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,880
Finally he got what he wanted

259
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,400
The eldest mistress gave birth to Wanwan

260
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,160
She couldn't bear the humiliation and committed suicide

261
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
since then

262
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,000
I tried my best to bring Wanwan out of the palace

263
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,760
But Wang Ruonian has been hunting us down

264
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,360
stop

265
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,680
Wanwan and I are desperate

266
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,160
Hiding in Tibet every day

267
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,440
turn out to be

268
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,600
This is how Xu Jing died

269
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,240
The person who is as bright as the moon in my heart

270
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,040
It's been three years since then

271
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,280
hellish life

272
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,800
and i know nothing

273
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,760
such a person

274
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,480
If not punished by God

275
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
I'm afraid people in the world will think

276
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,640
There is no god and no retribution in the world

277
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,600
Our Wang family’s business this year

278
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,000
great progress has been made

279
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,360
Minerals, cloth, medicinal materials, and pawn shops are all very good.

280
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,920
Thank you for your help.

281
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,640
Xu Xu Xu Jing

282
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Xu Xujing

283
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,560
you committed suicide

284
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,840
It's none of my business

285
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,880
Do you remember why I committed suicide?

286
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,520
And these three hairpins

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,960
This is your betrothal gift at that time

288
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,680
It's none of my business

289
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,080
It's none of my business

290
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,080
You are a woman from a poor family

291
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,800
Can you marry into our Wang family?

292
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,320
You should know that I have another purpose

293
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,200
You don't have a clear mind

294
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,720
why blame me

295
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,400
And what if I kill you?

296
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,040
you are already dead

297
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,760
You should stay well in the coffin

298
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,120
Jin Zhong

299
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,000
Jin Zhong Jin Zhong save me

300
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,720
This first knife

301
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,440
Punish you for being cold-blooded and ruthless

302
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,280
Killing a good woman

303
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
This second knife

304
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,560
Punish you for being ruthless and unjust

305
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,720
Let down a woman’s sincerity

306
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,920
And this third knife

307
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,240
It's divine punishment

308
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,880
Wang Ruonian, listen

309
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,440
from now on

310
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,360
heart for the rest of your life

311
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,920
They will all have these three knives stuck in them

312
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,360
every moment every second

313
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,400
The heart will suffer severe pain

314
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,280
until the moment of your death

315
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,640
And after you die

316
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,560
Go to Jiuyou to accept the punishment you deserve
