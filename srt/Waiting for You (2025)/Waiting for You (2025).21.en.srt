1
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,160
How was Ma Yichun's body treated?

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,760
Ma Yichun's body has been buried in Yuancang Mountain

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,920
It’s just that Sister Niu and Yichun have the best relationship

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,560
If Ichun dies, we are worried that something will happen to Sister Niu too.

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,840
Pay more attention to Niu A Pong’s condition

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,800
yes

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,840
As for Tong Feng

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,080
Everything is hidden from her according to the Lord's will

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,640
this is not true this is not true

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,400
mortal death

11
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,880
Their relatives always burn some paper money

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,200
Let them live a better life in Jiuyou

13
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,840
After death, we meet again in Jiuyou

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,160
But when the soul dies, there is nothing.

15
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,360
The soul dissipates between heaven and earth

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,280
No return date

17
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,120
Do you like to eat sweets the most on weekdays?

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,200
I never let you eat

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,000
Afraid of your tooth decay

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,800
if you can come back

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,960
I'll give you all the candies in Jiuyou

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,000
Sister Niu

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,280
what did you say

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,760
Who are you going to buy candy for?

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,920
Ichiharu is dead

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,200
what does death mean

27
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
Do you mean you'll never see him again?

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,920
Ichiharu is dead

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,240
Ichiharu is dead

30
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,760
Xuan Pei

31
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,640
Ichiharu is dead

32
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,560
Aren’t we souls?

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Why does the soul die?

34
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,960
If you get up first, your body won’t be able to bear it.

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,120
yesterday

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,000
Ma Yichun also told me that

37
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
Li Dafu is gone

38
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,360
He will stay with me

39
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,360
But now

40
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,280
He left too

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,760
I'll never see him again

42
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,840
never see him again

43
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,360
spring after spring

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,680
landlady

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,920
who are you

46
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm Simo

47
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,480
At the beginning of this year, you came to Wangchuan Soup Shop

48
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
When interviewing the younger brother

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,560
It's not like I haven't checked your details

50
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,320
Xuan Pei told you

51
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,080
The cake you gave to Tong Feng last night with a lantern

52
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,200
Still on Biluo's table

53
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,880
You said you like Tong Feng

54
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,120
Is this how you like Tong Feng?

55
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,760
why did you kill her

56
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,160
Lanterns bring cakes

57
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
If I say what happened last night has nothing to do with me

58
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,840
do you believe me

59
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,760
I poisoned Tongfeng

60
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,200
But the poison from before is slowly dissipating

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
There are records of the lanterns used by soup shops to deliver food

62
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,440
If you don't believe it

63
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
You can check if there were any lanterns from the soup shop last night

64
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,400
Go to Biluo

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,480
But you

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,920
Are they really demons?

67
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm leaving

68
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm talking to the boss lady

69
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,480
Farewell

70
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,520
Come to Jiuyou

71
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
It's to find your brother

72
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
What about me?

73
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,080
It's the Demon Lord of the Demon Realm

74
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,800
My brother is the demon king of the previous generation

75
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,360
I suspect that my brother is imprisoned in the Nine Netherworld

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,040
But there was a barrier placed by Xuan Pei

77
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,880
Only Tong Feng is extremely weak

78
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,240
When Xuan Pei did not hesitate to cultivate to save her

79
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,880
The barrier will loosen

80
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
but when i found out

81
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,400
when i like her

82
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
I've never taken poison again

83
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,520
You go

84
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,320
landlady

85
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,200
leave now

86
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,480
I think

87
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,160
Goodbye Tong Feng

88
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,640
I know I shouldn't

89
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,960
But I still want to see her again

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,760
And you know you shouldn't

91
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,560
But I have been waiting for so many years

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,880
Whatever you want

93
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,480
Xuan Pei

94
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,360
How did Ichiharu die?

95
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,480
Don't worry about this anymore

96
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,960
Why

97
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,520
Ma Yichun is dead

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,320
This matter is irreversible

99
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,960
Let's leave the investigation of the cause of death to the seducing soul.

100
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Xuan Pei, what are you talking about?

101
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,520
Jiuyou has its own laws and orders the death of Ma Yichun

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't worry about it anymore

103
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,440
Laws and Orders

104
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,040
Laws and Orders

105
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Another law

106
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,120
The first king's youth

107
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,640
It's because of this stupid law

108
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,680
After he hurt so many people

109
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,720
Not even close

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
Lived his life without disaster

111
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,720
And now it's because of the law

112
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
my good friend

113
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,440
Ichiharu is dead

114
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,520
If he's dead, can't I take care of him?

115
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,160
Tong Feng, you are just an ordinary soul from Jiuyou

116
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,840
And Ma Yichun is the second-rank minister of Jiuyou.

117
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,720
The death of Jiuyou’s ministers

118
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,640
It's always been kept secret

119
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,600
Xuan Pei

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,840
You are not sad at all when Ma Yichun died

121
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,440
Being an official in Jiuyou has always been extremely dangerous.

122
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,360
Everyone can die at any time

123
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,880
More than just Ma Yichun

124
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,440
I am also in the underworld

125
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,680
Everyone can die at any time

126
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,680
Xuan Pei

127
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,320
I found that I don't understand you

128
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
actually i know

129
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,520
You've hidden a lot from me

130
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,600
I thought you were hiding things before

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,720
It will never hurt me

132
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,760
But now

133
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,160
I'm not so sure anymore

134
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
I must keep this secret

135
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,160
I have guarded you for four thousand years

136
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,320
No matter what, I must protect you

137
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,920
Sir, the blood demon’s awakening

138
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,360
It still needs to be dealt with in time, otherwise the heaven will become suspicious.

139
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,920
But fortunately, the power of the blood demon in Tong Feng’s body

140
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,960
has been temporarily suppressed

141
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,080
Ah Ming quickly goes to Yuancang Mountain

142
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
After I covered up the traces of the Blood Demon

143
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,280
Come right away

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Subordinates obey orders

145
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,680
Didn't you say

146
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,440
will you stay with me forever

147
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,320
I have been making Wangchuan soup for four thousand years

148
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,360
Mortal life and death

149
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,800
You can't escape from this Xiuweijing well

150
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,640
and a bowl of Wangchuan soup

151
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,360
Little Mencius

152
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,280
Although Jiuyou controls the opportunities for mortals to practice,

153
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,040
But we have lived too long

154
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
Live for thousands of years

155
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,200
But we have forgotten the true meaning of life and death

156
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,640
Mortals face life and death in just a few decades in their lives

157
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,760
They understand better than we do

158
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,120
That's why they are afraid of death

159
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,840
Afraid of that bowl of Wangchuan soup in your hand

160
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,520
This is

161
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,080
This is Ma Yichun

162
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,400
Condensed from broken souls

163
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,640
Have you seen Ma Yichun's soul?

164
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,760
Then you

165
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,120
Then do you know how Ma Yichun died?

166
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,440
This is what Xuan Pei gave me

167
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,880
He asked me to hand it over to you

168
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,320
It’s Xuan Pei again

169
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,720
Do you really think Ma Yichun died?

170
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,200
Isn't Xuan Pei sad at all?

171
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Every day after Ma Yichun left

172
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,120
Xuan Pei misses him

173
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,720
Just as the Lord of Jiuyou Mansion

174
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,040
he has his responsibility

175
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,080
Xuan Pei could only hide his sadness deep in his heart

176
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,400
But why did he

177
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,560
Don't let me find out the cause of Ma Yichun's death?

178
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,320
Ma Yichun and I have known each other for three thousand years.

179
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,880
He is like my relative

180
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,360
I read the story in this play about the mortal world

181
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,160
Mortal relatives died unexpectedly

182
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,120
They will all get to the bottom of it

183
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,040
But we are the immortal souls in Jiuyou.

184
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,440
Are we not even as good as mortals?

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,080
Ma Yichun's death

186
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,960
Even if you don't tell me

187
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,320
I will also find out on my own.

188
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,120
Tongfeng

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,800
Ichun doesn't want to see you like this

190
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,600
I understand all these principles of Mencius

191
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,640
But this world doesn’t make things clear

192
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,080
Just know how to do it

193
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,680
Xiao Mencius, please go back first

194
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,520
I want to be alone

195
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,640
good

196
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,600
Then I'll go back to the soup shop and wait for you

197
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,920
Tong Feng, don’t be sad

198
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,840
I am the worst at coaxing girls.

199
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,360
I don’t want to see girls cry at all

200
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,160
Li Dafu, this stupid pig

201
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
Wait until he comes back

202
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,840
How about we beat him up together?

203
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,160
The play that adults like to watch the most is

204
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,040
Little Bear Yuanbao and his friends

205
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,800
Isn’t it particularly childish?

206
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,240
Tong Feng, don’t cry

207
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,880
Parting means meeting again

208
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
So don't be sad about parting

209
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
To meet again

210
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,200
And full of expectations

211
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,400
Gone

212
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,960
Isn't this your favorite storybook?

213
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,760
Then give this to me

214
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,400
I heard lord

215
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
I gave you a box of delicious candies

216
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,720
I want to eat

217
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,560
Tongfeng Tongfeng, I really like you

218
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,960
I will always be with Tong Feng

219
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Ma Yichun

220
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,040
I know you don't want to see me sad

221
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,080
I can't be sad

222
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,920
but

223
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,360
I can't let you leave without knowing anything
