1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,880
In summary

2
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Sister, have you met a scumbag?

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,920
right

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,880
I don't think he is a good person either.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,720
Sets of sweet words

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,720
He didn't confess to you last night

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,440
But I said I confessed to you

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,720
I just want you to think that you two have confirmed your relationship.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,680
Then I will take you down in one fell swoop, not wanting to be responsible

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,760
Too grandson, right?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,840
That's so outrageous, I'm going to beat him up.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,240
Who are you going to beat? How old are you now?

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,920
But you can

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,480
Post a post online

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,240
Just say that the prince of the Pei Group shows mercy everywhere

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,600
Xiaofeng

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,720
I don’t think that Pei Xuan is a good person.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
If he had liked you a long time ago

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,240
Why haven't I contacted you?

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,960
Want me to see if he's a sly black cat

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,720
You are just a stupid fat-headed fish

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,760
Otherwise, forget it.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,080
Fat-headed fish, can't I be a mermaid?

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
Are your classmates going together?

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,320
Are you writing about me?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,320
121 121 121

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,920
Everyone, keep up.

28
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Xiaofeng, run faster

29
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,880
If you don't hurry up

30
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,600
You can't finish the 800-meter run in four and a half minutes

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
You failed again

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,360
I really can't stand it anymore, why don't you go first?

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,880
I'll come find you soon

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,080
Go, go, go

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,960
what are you doing

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,240
why are you avoiding me

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,200
I

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,120
I don’t want to deal with scumbags

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm waiting for you at the end

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,640
What's going on

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,640
what are you doing

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,760
What's going on?

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,040
Pei Xuan, even if you are really a black cat

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
I also want to show you that the fat-headed fish is not easy to bully.

45
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,840
The boss is here to play scratch-off games

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,600
good

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,120
The boss also gave me one

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
Why did you think of buying lottery tickets today?

49
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,520
Take two more

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
I've been so unlucky lately

51
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
It’s okay if you meet a scumbag

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,640
Still embarrassed in front of the whole class

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,800
Mercury retrograde buys two lottery tickets for joy

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Let's go well

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,120
Take it

56
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,280
Two scratch-off tickets for the boss

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,720
boss boss

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,080
Give me one first. Give me one first.

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,480
Why are you cutting in line?

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,760
Not two sisters, I'm in a hurry

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,200
Just let me go first

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,040
How's that? We've been here for so long.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,800
Forget it, forget it, let him buy it first.

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,640
Thanks

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,960
Anyway, this money is all used for wasting money.

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,120
When to fight or not to fight?

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,800
Boss, I think I won the first prize

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
What a first prize

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,920
Young man, your life is really good.

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
It's really a first prize, a first prize, a first prize.

71
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,000
Thank you two beautiful sisters. I'm going to redeem the prize.

72
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,760
Look how good this life is for me

73
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,400
that lottery ticket

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,000
should be mine

75
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,840
Okay, okay

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
Hello fellow students

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,080
I am Tong Xiaofeng

78
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,560
Hello, senior sister, I have watched your "Nine Netherworld"

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm still your fan

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,680
Senior sister

81
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Is the male protagonist based on Senior Brother Pei?

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,520
You and Brother Pei

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
You and Senior Brother Pei, you two

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,520
How do you act like a reporter?

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Senior Brother Pei

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,280
Too romantic

87
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,680
Cinderella should wear your glass slipper

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,240
So romantic

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,240
Go ahead

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,640
Senior Brother Pei

91
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,000
Could you please invite classmate Tong Xiaofeng?

92
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,240
Tell me about it

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
Understanding the role of Xuan Pei

94
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,080
How come this person is being chased and intercepted?

95
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,880
Or a top scumbag

96
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,040
Or I really like that silly girl

97
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,440
I hope it’s the second kind

98
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,120
Xuan Pei’s original body is a cat

99
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
Can cause nerve damage indirectly

100
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,360
become

101
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,280
Love fish farming

102
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,960
But in his heart he pretends to be the world's common people

103
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,640
He is a qualified prince

104
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
I like the character Hyun Bae very much

105
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,640
Since it is a sharing meeting

106
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,560
I also want to share my favorite line

107
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,000
Brother Pei, do you want to recite Xuan Pei's lines?

108
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
Very good

109
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
This is a public execution

110
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,200
I'm going to have a heart attack

111
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,840
The clouds in the mountains float and the moon in the sky hangs forever

112
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,160
The clouds in the mountains chase the moon in the sky

113
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,640
There are all kinds of ingenious arrangements in the world

114
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,200
Arrange the staggering second by second

115
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,760
All the coincidences laid out

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,320
All are revelations

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,160
No, I never wrote this paragraph

118
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,200
Senior Brother Pei

119
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,960
I don't know what you are thinking

120
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,920
about novels

121
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,440
I admit

122
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,800
I wrote it based on you

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,400
But in the early stages of creation

124
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,280
I don't know at all

125
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,000
This novel will be on the bestseller list

126
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,320
Don't know either

127
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
It will be known to the whole school

128
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
if

129
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,080
you

130
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,280
It’s because of the novel that you treat me casually

131
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,920
That

132
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,280
That's sorry

133
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,720
I shouldn't be based on you

134
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,160
I shouldn't like you either

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
There are twenty-eight stars in the sky

136
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,480
There is a star named Shenxing

137
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
There is a star named Shang Xing

138
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,640
People say that ginseng merchants don’t meet each other

139
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,360
but i

140
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,360
I have to wait for this miracle

141
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,680
What do you mean

142
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,320
My teaching assistant's class ends next week

143
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,240
You, you want to leave

144
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,240
Tong Xiaofeng

145
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
You put me in your book

146
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,080
Having been a leading actor for so long

147
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,240
as compensation

148
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,400
you

149
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,960
Are you willing to be the heroine in my life?

150
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,240
Husband husband

151
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,920
Get up, Xiaochun, it’s time to go to school

152
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,600
let him go

153
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,640
You are still a human being

154
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,920
Your child is only eight years old and you let him go to school by himself

155
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
mom and dad

156
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,120
mom and dad

157
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,080
Mother

158
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,840
Dad, why hasn't he gotten up yet?

159
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,440
daddy

160
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,400
Dad can't send you to school today

161
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,560
Pei Xuan, what's the matter with you?

162
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
How could you treat your own son like this?

163
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,360
Mom and Dad won’t give me a gift

164
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,000
My classmates all thought my parents were divorced

165
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,480
Koharu

166
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,080
You are really daddy’s breathable little cotton-padded jacket

167
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,880
son

168
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,760
The confession that dad arranged with you

169
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,800
Remember everything clearly?

170
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,280
I remember clearly that I went to English class today

171
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,720
Didn't go to the amusement park to eat ice cream

172
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,200
What a good daddy's son

173
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,160
You two

174
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
Wife, listen to my explanation

175
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,920
It was all instigated by my son

176
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,120
Mom, dad insisted on taking me there

177
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,600
Come, come, come

178
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,400
Wife

179
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,160
Come, come, come

180
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,280
Wife, please listen to my explanation

181
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,080
I'm really not

182
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,480
tap tap tap

183
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,400
Be gentle, be gentle

184
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,040
Your best friend from college is coming to see you today

185
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
Yes, they even brought their family members with them.

186
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,080
Husband, please help me clear the table in a moment

187
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Okay, my supreme wife.

188
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,600
Mom and dad, please stop showing affection. I'm so hungry.

189
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,400
Then be hungry

190
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,120
Is it your own? Go and clean it up.

191
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,880
knew

192
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
I'll eat it soon

193
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,640
they arrived

194
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,040
knew

195
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,760
surprise

196
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
welcome welcome

197
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,000
This is Professor Liu

198
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,840
Professor Liu, my boyfriend

199
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Hello Tong Xiaofeng, actually we have already received the certificate.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,880
Leave him alone first

201
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,080
Just mind your sisters. I'm exhausted.

202
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,200
Come in and sit down

203
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,040
Hi Brother Pei

204
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,560
Little Huahua, long time no see

205
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,800
haven't seen you for a long time

206
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,720
Tong Xiaofeng, right?

207
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,040
listen to my sister

208
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,440
You are the prettiest girl in this neighborhood

209
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,680
This is

210
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,680
my brother

211
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,400
Hello brother

212
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
It's just a pity

213
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,320
She's so good-looking that she's already married

214
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,960
Okay, okay

215
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,760
If you don't do it well, I will starve to death.

216
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,400
I bought all the ingredients yesterday

217
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,280
Mother

218
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,240
Auntie Niu is here

219
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,920
Xiaochun hasn’t seen her aunt for so long

220
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,640
Do you miss your aunt?

221
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,240
Um

222
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,040
this child

223
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,280
They are all the same aunt

224
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,680
Buy the same toys every time

225
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,120
Why does he like Sister Niu so much?

226
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,160
This may be fate from a previous life.

227
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,640
Come in and sit down

228
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,160
good

229
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,080
Senior Brother Pei

230
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,760
Hello, Senior Brother Pei

231
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,040
Long time no see everyone

232
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,360
Husband, are you ready?

233
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,160
Come on, it's all done

234
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,360
Thank you Xiaofeng

235
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
welcome everyone

236
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,200
You're welcome, eat as much as you like

237
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,920
Okay, okay, I'm starving to death

238
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,400
My son should eat more vegetables

239
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,640
Xiaofeng

240
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,680
Is this Tian Xuan's latest starring role?

241
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,120
"Falling in Love with Me Accidentally"

242
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,640
Brother is so handsome, I love him so much

243
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,000
Take a break, please

244
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,640
Professor Liu is angry

245
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,400
What is he angry about?

246
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,720
He can't be compared with Tian Xuan

247
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,600
You're the kind of person who judges quality based on appearance

248
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,440
This statement is very outrageous

249
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
we as men

250
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,720
In the end, it still depends on character and knowledge.

251
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
You can pull me down

252
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,600
You only have these two things

253
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
Xiaofeng and I toast you all

254
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,320
Come

255
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,720
thank you for the treat thank you

256
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,120
This tastes better than the one you got last time

257
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,400
This tastes delicious

258
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,960
Come on, come on, add some food

259
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,560
Thanks

260
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,440
Just stay happy like this

261
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,400
Tong Xiaofeng and Pei Xuan in the 21st century

262
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,320
Have the cutest children and the most precious friends.

263
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,600
The most sincere love, such a happy life

264
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,720
adult

265
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,280
your time is almost up

266
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,800
Do you want to return to Jiuyou?

267
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,400
I've got what I want

268
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,600
Don't want to go back

269
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Ah Ming Jiuyou, I feel relieved to have you

270
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,920
The illusion can only last for decades

271
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
Do you really want to give up your identity as Fu Jun?

272
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,920
Will the illusion remain forever?

273
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,360
But only this

274
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
to keep her

275
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,760
Husband, why are you awake?

276
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,480
I just had a dream

277
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,360
Dreaming about someone wearing ancient clothes

278
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,320
Said he would take me somewhere

279
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,560
Stinky man

280
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,480
Where does he want to take my husband?

281
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,680
You can't go anywhere without me

282
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,400
husband

283
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,120
If there really is a next life

284
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,800
what you up to

285
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,440
If there is a next life
