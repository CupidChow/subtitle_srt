1
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,040
Is this a picnic?

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,880
I've seen it before in a drama.

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,360
After all, we are not at home

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,600
I can only bring out a few dishes.

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,920
These are all my favorite foods

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,640
Wanshan pork ribs with lotus root powder

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,840
And boneless chicken feet

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,680
Xuan Pei, why did you prepare these specially?

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,280
What if I don’t win?

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,760
Even if you lose I will take you out

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,920
You're such a boring person

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,200
you should say

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Tong Feng because I have confidence in you

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,520
you can definitely win

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,520
Me to our Tongfeng

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,000
Always the most confident

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,800
This is what Meng Dihua delivered to Biluo this morning.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,320
Tell me to deliver it to you

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,640
Congratulations on your successful completion

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,840
Three Realms Talent Contest Preliminary Round

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,600
Little Mencius is the best

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,160
Is it tasty

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,200
tasty

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,120
What's wrong

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,280
Xuan Pei, why am I a little sleepy?

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,600
Want to sleep very much

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,880
The roses in this pastry are soaked in wine

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,840
you have never had wine

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,880
It’s inevitable that you’ll feel a little dizzy the first time you eat it.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
You'll feel better if you come over and lie down for a while.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,720
My head feels so confused now

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
It is inevitable that you will feel a little drunk

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,440
What is drunkenness?

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,920
Not a good thing anyway

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,360
Stay away from it from now on

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,000
Stay away from whom

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,960
I don't

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,200
I just want to be with Xuan Pei forever

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,480
I'm so drunk after just a little wine.

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,640
It seems that I will never let you touch me in the future.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,640
who are you

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,680
I am your Xuan Pei

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,720
Xuan Pei

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,720
Xuan Pei

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,640
What is your favorite thing to eat?

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
Osmanthus and Date Cake

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,160
That

48
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,920
What is your favorite story book to read?

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,320
Little Bear Yuanbao and his friends

50
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,320
Those are only seen by the children of Jiuyou.

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,560
Because I want to inspect

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,520
Jiuyou Teen Popular Storybook

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,200
Printing and proofreading work

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,560
and you

55
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,000
You are the most

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,880
Who do you like?

57
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,320
it's always you

58
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Easy, comfortable, Ichiharu Ma

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,200
sit

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
This is the prize for my Dream Lottery.

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,080
Please keep it for me

62
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,440
I want to use it after I graduate

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,320
Wait until you graduate

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,040
What's the meaning

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,920
Think about it, what if I become a beggar after graduation?

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,280
Can you still entrust me with your dreams?

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,920
So that's it

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,200
Tong Feng, you are very smart

69
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,560
Okay, then give me a strand of your hair

70
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,720
What do you want my hair for?

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
Of course, it’s to give you a dream in the future.

72
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,240
To use the dream technique, you have to open the box

73
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,720
Let a breath of the dreamer come in

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,920
Hair, clothes, memories, everything is fine

75
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm thinking about the name of the person I want to dream of

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,960
When the box lights up white

77
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,640
You can enter the dreamland of the illusory person

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,800
Met him

79
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,920
I can still see you after you graduate.

80
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,400
You said you can help people in dreams to see illusions

81
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,720
Of course you won’t see the people in the illusion

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
How do you tell him about the lottery jackpot?

83
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,160
I originally wanted to go back after graduation

84
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,360
Maybe there's still a chance to meet them

85
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,440
One spring

86
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,680
Then can I give it to other souls?

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Who do you want to give it to?

88
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,040
Li Dafu

89
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,680
Li Dafu has always wanted to see his family

90
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,520
There is such an opportunity now

91
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,920
I think he needs it more than I do

92
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,440
I definitely can’t send it as a gift.

93
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,280
But you can take him to dream with you

94
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,880
Just use his memories

95
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,360
Without further ado, I’m going to find Li Dafu

96
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,600
I won't send you off in Yichun. You can go back by yourself.

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
this woman

98
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,480
Don't eat it

99
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,280
Who is so incompetent?

100
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,160
Tongfeng

101
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,800
Stop eating. Let me tell you something.

102
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,080
you say

103
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,720
My dream lottery ticket

104
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,880
Can help you see your mortal relatives

105
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,000
Tong Feng, what do you mean?

106
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,160
Do you want to give this to me?

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,040
Of course, I've asked about everything

108
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,800
It depends on which relative you want to see

109
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,560
Thank you Tong Feng

110
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,360
I miss my mother very much

111
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,040
Then go see your mother

112
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,520
Just wait a moment

113
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
I excerpt a memory of you and your mother

114
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,600
ok let's go

115
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,160
Walk

116
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,000
Mom, I am Dafu. I am back to see you.

117
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,200
Daifuku

118
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,840
you woke up

119
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,600
Mom is me, I am Dafu

120
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,880
Daifuku

121
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,640
You've been unconscious for so long

122
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,080
This is the first time my mother has dreamed of you.

123
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,240
daughter

124
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,680
You and Dad

125
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,200
Are your brothers and sisters okay?

126
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,760
Good, they are all good

127
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,200
Your sister gave birth to a big fat boy

128
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
Especially love to laugh

129
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,600
often around your bed

130
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
call uncle

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
uncle

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,040
beside my bed

133
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,840
daughter

134
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,520
It’s been so long and I haven’t been buried yet?

135
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,400
Our whole family is waiting for you to wake up day and night

136
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
How can I bury you?

137
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
wake up

138
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,720
aunt

139
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,280
Why do you say Dafu can wake up?

140
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,520
three years ago

141
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,680
Dafu fell down

142
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,760
Hit a rock

143
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
never woke up again

144
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,280
The doctor said

145
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,040
Can temporarily save life

146
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
But when will I wake up?

147
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,120
have no idea

148
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,600
But anyway

149
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,080
It's always good to have something to think about

150
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,120
Mother, what do you mean?

151
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,440
I'm not dead yet

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,880
What is immortal?

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,120
Your father and I go searching for thousand-year-old ginseng every day.

154
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,440
Come and make some soup for you

155
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
How could you die?

156
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,800
Just didn't wake up

157
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,520
Didn't wake up

158
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,360
Dafu, it turns out you are not dead

159
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
That's

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,720
Why am I in Jiuyou?

161
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,440
You are hungry because you are not dead

162
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,680
So you have never been able to complete your career

163
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,720
The soul cannot be hungry. I was curious before.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,280
Why do you keep shouting that you are hungry?

165
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,080
It turns out that the key point is here.

166
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,880
Tongfeng

167
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
this feeling

168
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,760
i can feel my body

169
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,520
my heart

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,600
The feeling of your heart beating continuously in your chest

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,960
And this kind of warmth

172
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,240
This is not what a soul should feel like

173
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,920
Am I really not dead?

174
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,200
Xuan Pei

175
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,320
Mr. Li, now your yang energy has returned to your body.

176
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,480
You can return to the mortal world

177
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,920
adult

178
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,720
Am I really not dead?

179
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,800
It's you who suffers from Lean Soul Syndrome

180
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,960
The body has been sleeping in the mortal world for three years

181
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,640
Your family is waiting by your side day and night

182
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm looking forward to your return

183
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,560
Xuan Pei, why didn’t you tell Dafu earlier?

184
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,800
In fact, he didn't die

185
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,840
so

186
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,680
He can return to the mortal world sooner

187
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,960
Occasionally suffer from soul separation syndrome in the mortal world

188
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
body in mortal world

189
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,720
The heart pulse is not stopped, the breath is not stopped

190
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Will be mistakenly connected to Jiuyou

191
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,920
This type of soul is different from ordinary souls

192
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,440
Feeling warm and cold, feeling full and hungry

193
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,200
The yang energy that gives birth to the soul exists in the heart orifice

194
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,840
If Yang Qi is lost

195
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
will be transformed from a living soul into a ghost soul

196
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,400
Such souls cannot pass through others

197
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,960
I learned that my yang energy was still in my body

198
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,040
Otherwise, you will lose your mind

199
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,320
Yang Qi is drained away

200
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,080
So no one can tell Dafu

201
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,280
In fact, he didn't die

202
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,640
Otherwise he will die instantly

203
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,000
Fortunately, fortunately

204
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,840
no one told him before

205
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,360
Ma Yichun asked me to take Dafu to dream

206
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,400
It turns out he already knew

207
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,720
He wants Dafu

208
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,720
He discovered that he was not dead

209
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,800
because of your kindness

210
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,680
I gave Dafu the opportunity to dream.

211
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,280
Only then does he have a chance

212
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,840
Now the yang energy returns to the body

213
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,240
If you stay in Jiuyou for a long time,

214
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,520
Yin energy will enter your body

215
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,240
I'll get seriously ill when I go back

216
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
It's okay Tong Feng

217
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,800
Nine Nethers exist forever

218
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,160
Maybe my life on earth

219
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,560
But it’s just a blink of an eye.

220
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,920
Maybe I'll be back soon

221
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,200
I just don’t know that I’m back in Jiuyou

222
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,360
Will he still be the current Li Dafu?

223
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,120
I don’t know when the time will come.

224
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,600
can you still recognize me

225
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,880
like me

226
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,200
what did you say

227
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,120
Don’t you have any confidence in your best friend?

228
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,160
I have never been able to graduate

229
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,920
No one wants to be close to me

230
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,160
Even if there is

231
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,120
Most of them are just greedy for wealth and popularity.

232
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,360
except family

233
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,200
You, Tong Feng, are the only one who can take my emotions into consideration

234
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,440
Take care of my mood

235
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,080
He usually laughs and curses when he gets along with me

236
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,520
truly consider me a friend

237
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
That's it

238
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,480
I am Li Dafu

239
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
can't thank you enough

240
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,320
Bless me

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,680
Tongfeng

242
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,960
You, you can't cry, you are the little overlord of Jiuyou

243
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,320
how can you cry

244
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,480
Believe me

245
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,520
us

246
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,120
Will definitely meet again

247
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,920
If you don't go to Xiuweijing again, you will return to the mortal world.

248
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,560
There won't be enough time

249
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,760
Tongfeng

250
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,480
I have to go

251
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,440
There's nothing left for you

252
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,200
This is for you

253
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,280
After I leave

254
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,040
You open it again

255
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,320
Daifuku

256
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,320
You must live well

257
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,160
Tongfeng

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,080
goodbye

259
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,040
goodbye

260
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,000
Daifuku

261
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,880
you must

262
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,400
spend your life happily

263
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
This is Dafu's deposit

264
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
It is better to make a huge sum of money than to ask for help.

265
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,640
Tong Feng takes it and doesn’t finish the flowers. Don’t come to see me.

266
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,920
Daifuku

267
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,120
Don't worry, Daifuku's chances are great.

268
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,720
Will make my wish come true in my life

269
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,320
Okay, stop crying

270
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,280
And I will always be with you

271
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,280
Xuan Pei

272
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,120
will you stay with me forever

273
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,360
certainly

274
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,360
Enter

275
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,760
Tongfeng, are you okay?

276
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,600
You've had a spring

277
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,360
Although Li Dafu is gone

278
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,240
But we'll see you soon

279
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,640
Think about it, he can live for another thirty years at most

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,720
Thirty years passed quickly

281
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,920
Then I still want Dafu

282
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,320
Live a little longer

283
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,480
After all, he still needs to practice when he returns to Jiuyou

284
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,320
He doesn't like studying any more than I do

285
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,600
I'm afraid you'll be sad if you're still open-minded.

286
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,800
So come and see you

287
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
One spring talks about great blessings

288
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,640
I still have to thank you very much

289
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,280
If it weren't for you reminding me

290
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,600
Give Dafu the chance to win lottery prizes

291
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
He won't lose his yang energy so quickly.

292
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,960
But you're still sad, right?

293
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,200
I once watched the play "Mortal Words"

294
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,800
Mortal life and death

295
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,120
But I have never experienced it

296
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,880
I didn't expect it to be such a sad thing

297
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,960
Tong Feng, you used to give me candies

298
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,000
This time I will give it to you to eat

299
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,920
Ate my candy

300
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Don't be sad

301
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,080
hold

302
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,480
Li Dafu is a living soul

303
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,000
come and go

304
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
I won’t stay in Jiuyou forever

305
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,600
But I am the Minister of Jiuyou

306
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,320
I have to stay in Jiuyouli

307
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,000
I will always be with Tong Feng

308
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,920
Wangchuan Soup Shop is considerate and considerate

309
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,960
Return to the princess

310
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
What did you tell me about the living soul in Jiuyou?

311
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,280
Already done

312
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,840
The pastries have been delivered to Biluo
