1
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,120
Tongfeng

2
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,520
Si Mo

3
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
you cried

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,680
Did Xuan Pei bully you?

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,920
No

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,600
I want to go to Wangchuan Soup Shop

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,800
Are you going too?

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,720
Si Mo, look

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,760
Brother made you a bracelet

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,880
You have to wear it

11
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,800
How to weave this bracelet

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,640
It was your brother's own creation that no one else would know.

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,480
Brother, I don’t want the bracelet

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,240
I want a sugar man

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,200
Put it on quickly

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Four thousand years have passed since the Demon Lord

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,280
Some people have already given up their obsession

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,240
Why do you have to cling to the past?

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,680
impossible

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,080
this is impossible

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,040
Is this wine?

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,440
It's wine that can relieve a thousand worries

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
I remember the time of the Three Realms Talent Competition

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,040
You gave me a snack to celebrate

25
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,360
There was wine-stained rose inside and I ate a few pieces.

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,520
Then I fell asleep so dark that the sky was dark.

27
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,440
Then you should be able to sleep well tonight

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,600
Alcohol can numb your mood

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,320
But what about after waking up?

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,000
what do I do

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,240
Let's talk about it after we wake up.

32
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,600
I just want to know how Ma Yichun died

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,720
why didn't he tell me

34
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,240
Sir, maybe you really have your own reasons for this?

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,280
Difficulties

36
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,200
Little Mencius, I know

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,600
Have you always thought I was stupid?

38
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,480
But let me tell you I'm not stupid at all

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,320
Xuan Pei is the big idiot

40
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,320
He always felt

41
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,000
There are a lot of things I can't handle

42
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,240
But I am already three thousand years old

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,640
I can handle many things by myself

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,760
I know you can handle a lot of things on your own

45
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,440
But I can do it for you

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,680
I can't bear to make you troubled

47
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,480
Little Mencius

48
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,440
Why do you look a bit like Xuan Pei?

49
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,480
come home with me

50
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,080
go home

51
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,960
go home

52
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Little Mencius

53
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,480
Why do I feel like you've gained weight recently?

54
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,080
You can even carry me

55
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,680
Because I am not little Mencius but Xuan Pei

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,960
Xuan Pei

57
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,000
Xuan Bae is a big idiot

58
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,680
I am

59
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,160
Xuan Pei is a big pig hoof

60
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,040
For me, it’s fine with any sauced pork knuckle.

61
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,240
Xuan Pei why?

62
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,720
Don't let me find out the cause of Ma Yichun's death?

63
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,680
because

64
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,120
because

65
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,120
That's a truth that you must never know

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,720
Why does Xuan Pei like to watch

67
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,640
Little Bear, Little Bear Yuanbao, what about this play?

68
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,240
Because the moment you wake up

69
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,600
came from outside the window

70
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
The ending song of Little Bear Yuanbao

71
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,320
Xuan Pei has many shortcomings

72
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,960
Love to wear white clothes

73
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,520
He always speaks hesitantly

74
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,520
mysterious

75
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,120
Huanlao and Mingxiang are alone in a room

76
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,080
Being alone in a room with the underworld

77
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,120
That's for official business

78
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,560
Like to wear white clothes

79
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,640
It's because you always liked to wear white clothes in the past

80
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,560
Don't like to laugh

81
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,120
Don’t I like to laugh?

82
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,400
Hyun Pei looks so good when he smiles

83
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,360
He always keeps a straight face

84
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,600
I like Hyun Bae’s smile

85
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Besides Xuan Baixiao, what else do you like?

86
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,920
also like

87
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,440
I also like Xuan Pei to turn me into flowers

88
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,920
There are stars and snow

89
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,160
I watched the drama "Mortal Stories" a few days ago

90
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,920
That country loves snow all the time

91
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,480
The hero and heroine walked and walked in the snow

92
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,800
The snow fell on their hair

93
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,960
It's like growing old together

94
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
snow

95
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,840
But it has never snowed in Jiuyou

96
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,960
In this way

97
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,640
Jiuyou is really an unromantic place

98
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,240
no stars no snow

99
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,000
But even so

100
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,200
As long as Xuan Pei is here

101
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,720
It is the most romantic place in the three worlds

102
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,760
Mr. Liu, look, it’s going to snow soon.

103
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,800
snow

104
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,400
I haven’t seen snow in Jiuyou for thousands of years

105
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,160
Why did it suddenly snow today?

106
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
If you say you are stupid, you are not smart

107
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,480
The weather conditions in Jiuyou

108
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,160
Don’t always follow the mood of adults

109
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,400
It will definitely snow all over the world

110
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,160
Just for Pomeranian to smile

111
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,000
You made these vixen comments again

112
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,240
Why can't I catch it?

113
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,120
It's snowing now

114
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
It's all in your hands

115
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,240
This snowflake seems like I'm in the devil world

116
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,440
See the Nine Moons Spirit Flower

117
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,800
I tell you

118
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,880
The Nine Moon Spirit Flower

119
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,080
Or was it Xuan Pei who changed it for me?

120
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,760
Although Xuan Pei is now

121
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,160
The boss has a face

122
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,680
Don't do human affairs

123
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,080
Than Teacher Liu Taigong

124
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
Still bitter and full of hatred

125
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,680
but

126
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,120
I really like it very much

127
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,240
I like Xuan Pei so much

128
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
I like you very much Tong Feng

129
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,920
The emperor's ministers came to answer the orders

130
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,560
How's it going?

131
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,000
Return to Heaven Emperor

132
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
That Lord of Jiuyou Mansion really doesn’t know what’s good and what’s good

133
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,240
He's also very rude when he speaks

134
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,680
between a few words

135
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,360
It turned out that the generals and heavenly soldiers

136
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,480
drove away together

137
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
drove away

138
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,960
Xuan Pei is still the same as before

139
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,760
Emperor God, you guessed it right

140
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,000
The Lord of Jiuyou Mansion seems to be covering up the blood demon thing

141
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,320
No problem

142
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,520
Xuan Pei is a reasonable person

143
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,600
If the blood demon really wakes up

144
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,320
He will never sit idly by and ignore it.

145
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
only

146
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,120
Whatever

147
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,000
It was already four thousand years ago

148
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,800
Having said that

149
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,240
But the Lord of Jiuyou Mansion doesn’t know how high the sky is and how high it is

150
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,160
He is the prince of Jiuyou again

151
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,440
It’s just the new king

152
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,280
He has only been in charge of Jiuyou for thousands of years

153
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,320
Emperor of Heaven, you have been in charge of heaven for hundreds of thousands of years

154
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,920
enough

155
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,920
Three realms coexist

156
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,400
The Lord of Jiuyou Mansion has the same status as this Emperor

157
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,960
It's not for you to comment

158
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,640
I have overstepped my bounds

159
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,960
It’s just that Xuan Pei drove you back

160
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
There should still be something to hide

161
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,880
The three realms have been peaceful for too long

162
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm afraid there will be some trouble recently

163
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,400
I want to catch mandarin ducksI want to catch mandarin ducks

164
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,440
mandarin duck

165
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,320
Actually it's a duck

166
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,280
duck what duck

167
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,920
This is the mandarin duck I bought for fifty Mingjing.

168
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,800
From a song that I particularly liked in the past

169
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,360
So I sang Yuanyang

170
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,400
How do you sing that song?

171
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:23,920
Is my daughter beautiful when she is drunk?

172
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,160
Beauty, you are always the most beautiful

173
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
Xuan Pei, can you help me draw my eyebrows?

174
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,080
Isn't there a saying in the mortal world called "What is it?"

175
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,120
Raise the case together

176
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
All couples should raise their eyebrows together

177
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,920
Then can you draw my eyebrows for me?

178
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,640
The key point of raising eyebrows is not to draw eyebrows.

179
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,680
Don’t you know how to draw?

180
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,720
I will learn it

181
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,040
Finally there’s something you don’t know how to do

182
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,000
It's so embarrassing

183
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,880
What should I do?

184
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,480
Xuan Pei, please don’t leave, okay?

185
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,400
Look, it's so dark outside

186
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm so scared to be alone

187
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,160
Xuan Pei

188
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,640
Don't go

189
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,480
Okay, you're drunk.

190
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,960
How about we take a rest early?

191
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,760
you didn't say forever

192
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,840
Do you all want to be my little Peipei?

193
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,760
Tong Feng, don’t ever think about drinking again.

194
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,440
How could I say such disgusting words?

195
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,480
It's over, it's over

196
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,600
How can I see Xuan Pei now?

197
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Why are you hungry here?

198
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,920
I

199
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm not hungry

200
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,400
I had vomiting and fussing last night

201
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,120
How could I not be hungry this morning?
