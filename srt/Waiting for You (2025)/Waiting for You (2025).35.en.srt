1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,320
I will still be with you

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,320
henceforth

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,400
Spring rain is me, Xia Yang is me

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,440
Autumn leaves are me

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,120
Winter snow is also me

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,680
I want you, I just want you

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,160
Tongfeng

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,560
Little Mencius asked me at that wedding

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,440
When did I fall in love with you

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,440
Actually I don't know either

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,600
but

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,800
you are already deep

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,480
Engraved into my heart

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,960
Can't erase

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,280
don't want

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,640
No

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,160
As a prince, I order you

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,080
henceforth

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,240
forget me

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,640
Sacrifice Jiuyou with my blood

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,760
Can only be restored in the mortal world

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,400
no no no

23
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,760
She is Chun Yu, she is Xia Yang

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,480
She is Akiba

25
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,280
She is Xia Yang

26
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,480
She is autumn leaves, she is winter snow

27
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
she likes sweets

28
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,240
Recognize ducks as mandarin ducks

29
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,760
She is the god of all things in the world

30
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,800
she is my wife

31
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,280
She is Chunyu She is Chunyu

32
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
from now on

33
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,160
There is no more Tongfeng in the world

34
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,960
This is He Junwei

35
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,800
I want to be with Hyun Bae forever

36
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,040
four hundred and forty disease

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,280
Lovesickness is the most painful

38
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,400
If you forget

39
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,040
If you can calm your heart that is in extreme pain,

40
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,920
Is it because the world underestimates the power of lovesickness?

41
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,960
Deep love has been engraved into the bone marrow

42
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,040
Mere memory

43
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
How could I resist his fatal lovesickness?

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,080
Pluto, why are you so sentimental?

45
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,880
Have you read too many storybooks?

46
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,680
Or is it that you have found someone?

47
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,920
you

48
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
You don't understand anything

49
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,840
Yes, yes, we don’t understand anything

50
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,080
By the way, I’m not sure how many pages there are in the Book of Life and Death.

51
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,480
Let you fix it

52
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,800
He is just old

53
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,360
right

54
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,160
Xiao'e

55
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
Do you remember when this emperor

56
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,840
Do you have this pair of earrings?

57
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,960
Since Xiao'e first saw you

58
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,200
You've been wearing this pair of pearl earrings

59
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,080
Lived too long

60
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,960
I don’t even remember who gave me the earrings.

61
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,240
I just think he is a very important person

62
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,800
Si Mo

63
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,280
You said that I obviously made up this bracelet myself.

64
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,920
But why do I always feel like me

65
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,120
given to others

66
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,200
But I can't remember who it is

67
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,000
Have we forgotten something?

68
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,920
What did you forget?

69
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,120
I was born as Lord of Jiuyou Mansion

70
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,920
Receive blessings from heaven and earth

71
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,720
Enjoy the love and respect of mortals and shoulder the burden of common people

72
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,680
Use my blood to protect all things in the world

73
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,400
I protect the world

74
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,120
But what I want to protect most

75
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,880
It's still you

76
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,040
Did I forget to feed you again?

77
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,880
I really don’t know what you have been doing all these years

78
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,280
How did you survive?

79
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,440
adult

80
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,600
My subordinates have sorted out the book of life and death.

81
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,040
Ah Ming, I always feel at ease when you do things.

82
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,800
Sir, what's the matter?

83
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,760
Everything is fine now

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,080
Everything is normal in the mortal world and Xiuweijing

85
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
But I don’t know why

86
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
I always feel like something is missing

87
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,320
It's like something has been cut off

88
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,520
I don't know

89
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,440
Be a god and live as long as heaven

90
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,480
Long lasting life

91
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,400
Is it really a good thing?

92
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,520
Everyone longs for the art of immortality

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,160
Maybe for mortals

94
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
That's a good thing

95
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,360
Have a long life

96
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,600
Equivalent to eternal loneliness

97
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,440
We manage the replacement

98
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,440
But I have never experienced earthly fate

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,400
I want to go to Fantasyland and experience it myself

100
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,880
Feel the encounter like a mortal

101
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,640
Reunion, parting, meeting again

102
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,800
Sir, have you really decided?

103
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,400
Your Excellency, the repair well has been opened

104
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,880
After drinking this bowl of Wangchuan soup

105
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,200
You will lose all your power

106
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,080
Fall into fantasy

107
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,880
adult

108
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,440
May you get what you want this time

109
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,720
sisters

110
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,320
my novel

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,640
Rush to the bestseller list

112
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
First place

113
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,040
true or false

114
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
Is it the book "Nine Netherworlds"?

115
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,200
Um

116
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
Treat, treat, treat

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
no problem

118
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,320
Xiaofeng

119
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,120
What about your book being on the bestseller list?

120
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
It seems that the counselor found out

121
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
He was sent to the grade group

122
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,360
What

123
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,920
you see

124
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,840
What's the point? Number one on the bestseller list

125
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,080
This is a good thing

126
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,160
Are you stupid?

127
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
It was written based on Pei Xuan and her

128
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,120
Now it has been sent to the grade group

129
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,600
What about her secret crush on Senior Brother Pei?

130
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,720
Isn’t it already known to everyone?

131
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,600
Is Xiaofeng Xuanpei the same as Senior Brother Pei?

132
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,080
Is it you Tong Feng?

133
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,480
Tong Xiaofeng came to the counselor’s office

134
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,520
I have something to tell you

135
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,400
The counselor came to see me

136
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,320
I heard it's behind the counselor's office

137
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,480
The lights on that path were broken recently.

138
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
No one dares to go there anymore

139
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,320
Anyway, you must pass by it when you go back to your dormitory.

140
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,680
What

141
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
It's really dark

142
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,360
No way, we can’t really meet each other, right?

143
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,120
Pei

144
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,640
Senior brother

145
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,400
Tong Xiaofeng

146
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,880
Scared me to death

147
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,920
If you haven't done anything wrong, why should you be afraid?

148
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,200
I

149
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,800
I can walk and sit upright

150
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,800
I

151
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,800
Brother Pei, what do you mean?

152
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,000
You are the spring rain, the summer sun, the autumn leaves, and the winter snow.

153
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,400
is my wife

154
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,280
Xuan Pei

155
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,920
You really thought I was Xuan Pei

156
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,200
No, no, it’s not you who read the novel

157
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,680
That novel was actually not written by me.

158
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,640
You've all seen the ending

159
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,200
Why write such a sad ending?

160
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,440
The editor asked me to write it

161
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,120
She said she would have it

162
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,000
A sad ending will make it more soul-stirring

163
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,040
Admit it was you who wrote it

164
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,200
Senior Brother Pei

165
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,840
You deceived me

166
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,640
Do I really look like a cat?

167
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,200
Isn't it just a cat that is mysterious, elegant and loves to show off its fur?

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,720
No artistic processing

169
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Then why should I be the model?

170
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,680
Senior Brother Pei

171
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,120
You lied to me again

172
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,120
Thought I was going to kiss you

173
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,720
No no

174
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,600
That me

175
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,600
I might have misunderstood

176
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,520
You guessed it right

177
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,000
How is Xiaofeng doing?

178
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,760
What did the counselor tell you that you were there for so long?

179
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,360
yes

180
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
He asked me to give

181
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,120
Juniors and juniors

182
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,200
Hold a sharing session about novels

183
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,280
Okay, good thing, then you should behave well then

184
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,720
I'm on my way there

185
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,080
Met Senior Brother Pei

186
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,000
What

187
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,120
He seems to have read my novel

188
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,200
Then did you take the opportunity to confess to him?

189
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,880
he seems

190
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,480
Sister, please tell me quickly. Some of the sisters are in a hurry.

191
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
he he seems

192
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,240
For me writing him into the novel

193
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm not angry at all about this.

194
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,920
He's definitely not angry

195
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,520
Authors like this kind of young beauty

196
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,880
It's not too late for him to be happy

197
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,160
But

198
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,040
Why did he kiss me?

199
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,720
What

200
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,360
ah

201
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,200
He kissed you

202
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,840
Ouch, big news

203
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,240
Then what did he say after kissing you?

204
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,120
Without me, I would

205
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,080
I'll be back in a panic

206
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,920
said nothing

207
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,600
This beast

208
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,280
scum

209
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,360
rogue

210
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,720
He might have said something at that time.

211
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,000
But I, I was so panicked that I came back

212
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
It's okay, I have his class tomorrow

213
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,800
See if he looks for you after class.

214
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,600
The students seem to be very lively today

215
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,640
Brother Pei, have you watched "Nine Netherworld"?

216
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Please discuss anything unrelated to class after class.

217
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,520
Everyone, open the book to the first chapter

218
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,760
This concludes today’s lesson

219
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,160
Do you have anything to ask, classmates?

220
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,080
Senior Brother Pei

221
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
Just now a classmate said that you were

222
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
Confessed to Tong Xiaofeng

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,080
Is this true?

224
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,120
This woman

225
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,080
I have to beat her up when I turn around.

226
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
What does it have to do with you?

227
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,480
I don’t know, I don’t know

228
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,720
is it true

229
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,600
yes

230
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,280
I confessed to her

231
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,640
Xiaofeng, where are you going?

232
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,960
Why is he like this?

233
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,400
in front of so many people

234
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,600
wrong

235
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,400
When did he confess his love to me?

236
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,400
last night

237
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,240
Senior Brother Pei Pei Pei Pei

238
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,520
Classmate, you don’t seem to have a very good memory.

239
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,600
When did you confess your love to me?

240
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,680
How come I don't know

241
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,280
Don't try to lie to me

242
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,920
What can I do?

243
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,840
My bride doesn’t seem very smart

244
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,240
who is your bride

245
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,760
You forgot what you wrote in the book
