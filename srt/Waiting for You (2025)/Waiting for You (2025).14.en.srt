1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,120
Sick for a few days

2
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,160
There is still so much homework

3
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,320
Kyuubi-sensei is so inhumane

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Tongfeng Tongfeng

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,880
Someone is looking for you

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
Xu Jing

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,120
Xu Jing

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,880
Miss Tongfeng

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,120
I have been officially removed from the Evil Spirit Path

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,280
I came here specifically to thank you today

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,760
What are you grateful for?

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,640
It's all small things

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,600
Don't take it to heart

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,920
I have a few words to say to you alone

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,760
alone

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,640
Isn't this just carrying me behind your back?

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,040
I brought you here

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,560
Do you still have any conscience?

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,720
What to say

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,600
This is something that the noble Lord Ma Yichun cannot listen to.

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,120
Ma Yichun

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,800
As a soul, you must learn to read other people’s eyes

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,200
Sorry, Mr. Ma Yichun

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,680
Ma Yichun

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,080
That's pretty much it

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,480
Please take a seat

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,320
It’s great that you can avoid entering the realm of evil spirits.

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,280
Before falling into the path of evil spirits

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,520
All I can think about is

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,120
Why am I treated poorly?

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,160
Why can Wang Ruonian love other people so much?

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,760
Dancing girls of Peony orchid Paramount

33
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,720
certainly

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,520
And the person he can't face

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,760
he loves them

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,640
But put me to death

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,240
Since he doesn't want my precious love

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,560
It's him who loses, not me

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,120
Because to this day

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,520
I understand one thing

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,640
What's up

42
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,920
there is a person

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,320
He gave me his unique love

44
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,960
In a fantasy world, I am the richest person

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,400
Miss Tongfeng

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,000
I will wait patiently for Lin Qing in Jiuyou

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,040
Wait for him to tell me

48
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,120
The love that surpasses all in this world

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,920
That's great of you to think so.

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,560
in life

51
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,920
Money and power are fleeting

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,520
Once you enter the Nine Netherworld, everything is empty

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,240
But there's only one thing Jiuyou can't take away

54
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,280
Is it true love?

55
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,160
Only true love can't be taken away

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,000
Um

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,960
To truly love someone is a miracle

58
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
If you have such a miracle

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
You must tell him quickly

60
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
my miracle

61
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,720
That day I fell into the realm of evil spirits

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,200
Almost hurt the girl

63
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,480
The gentleman in white next to you

64
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,880
Knock me back with magic

65
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,360
He cherishes you in his arms

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,160
The way he looked at you then

67
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,680
Make my heart tremble

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
eyes

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,600
Lin Qing looked at me that way back then.

70
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,480
Miss Tongfeng

71
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
Now I tell you this

72
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,840
Can you find your own miracle?

73
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,360
my miracle

74
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
It's Xuan Pei

75
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,560
Tongfeng

76
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,840
Xuan Pei

77
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,480
What do you want to see me for so late?

78
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,040
My magic can only create this moment of fireworks

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,760
But I still want to give you this starry sky

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,880
Tongfeng

81
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,480
Xuan Pei Xu Jing came to me today and told me a lot of things

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,400
She made me understand one thing

83
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,600
What

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,840
She said human life is short

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Being able to truly love someone is a miracle

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
to be truly loved by others

87
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,000
It is God’s best blessing

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,160
Xuan Pei

89
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,040
I have been bathing in God's grace

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,400
Ever since I opened my eyes in Jiuyou three thousand years ago

91
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,080
There are many friends around me who love and care for me

92
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,720
Unlike those lonely ghosts in Jiuyou

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm very grateful

94
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,680
God gave me such a gift

95
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,280
Xu Jing let me know

96
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,240
I have already

97
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,360
got my miracle

98
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,360
But people are always greedy

99
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,480
get a miracle

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,520
I still want to tell it

101
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,000
Ask for another good blessing from it

102
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,080
you got a miracle

103
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,920
right

104
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,680
Xuan Pei

105
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,680
I

106
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,880
i have always liked you

107
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,480
More than I like rag dolls and lotus cakes, there are also scripts

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,280
In total, I like you a lot more

109
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,280
I didn't understand the meaning of love before

110
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
But she said that if you love someone

111
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,720
Just tell him immediately

112
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Because you don't know the next moment

113
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,960
What kind of accident will happen that will cause lifelong regret?

114
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,520
Xuan Pei, let me tell you

115
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,400
I tell you all my love

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,560
are you willing to accept

117
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,240
My miracle?

118
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,200
The resurgence of fireworks in the mortal world is called a miracle

119
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,920
The appearance of stars in the Nine Nether Sky is a miracle

120
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,760
Now I will give my miracle

121
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,480
Give it to you

122
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,760
Xuan Pei, let me tell you

123
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,120
I tell you all my love

124
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,960
are you willing to accept

125
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,440
My miracle?

126
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,160
The appearance of stars in the Nine Nether Sky is a miracle

127
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,080
Now I will give you my miracle

128
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,360
Who is it?

129
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
Tongfeng

130
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,000
There is definitely something wrong with these two people

131
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,720
What’s wrong with you

132
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,440
This ice bowl is so cold that it touches my fingers

133
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,600
it hurts

134
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,560
Really

135
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,240
Oh my god

136
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,840
Oh my god

137
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,840
I'm blind, I'm blind

138
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,240
release

139
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,880
Niu Mei and the others just now

140
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,400
That them over there

141
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,400
Speak slowly

142
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,360
what happened

143
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
allow me to slow down

144
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,240
Tong Feng finally understands what love is

145
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,200
I, Ma Yichun, have taught her earnestly over the years.

146
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,040
It’s not in vain.

147
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,320
What do you mean?

148
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,720
Don’t you understand this?

149
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,680
Tong Feng understood her love for adults

150
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
is different

151
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,320
Tong Feng and the adults are going to be together completely

152
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,880
You said Tong Feng and Sir are real and fake?

153
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
You still don’t believe me when I tell you this?

154
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,240
you just now

155
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,960
I really don’t know what I saw

156
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,320
Your Excellency, I have been struck twice by lightning.

157
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,600
Didn't shout a word

158
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,600
I just got a bowl of icing cheese

159
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,160
He just screamed to Tong Feng that his hands hurt.

160
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,280
Tong Feng breathed hot breath on the adults' fingers

161
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,680
Her eyes are so gentle that they are about to drip with water

162
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,160
I'm really going blind

163
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,800
So where is this big news?

164
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,520
I want to see it too

165
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,920
Just over there

166
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,040
Meng Dihua, you are here too

167
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,800
I

168
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,200
It's a good thing that Tong Feng knows

169
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,240
Yes, yes, yes

170
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,200
Come here quickly

171
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,120
what

172
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,000
The little wife nicknamed Mr. Waifu Jun is here to stay

173
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,800
The Lord of Bingbing Mansion wraps his fingers around his beloved wife's incarnation

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,920
Exclusive insider gossip

175
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,800
Do you want one?

176
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,400
I want it too

177
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,320
The boss gives you money

178
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,080
Take it yourself

179
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,800
release

180
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,400
Come here

181
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,520
Niu Mei Niu Mei Niu Mei pay attention

182
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,680
You said you don't have a handle on what you say?

183
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,000
You clearly know what Ogihana is to adults

184
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,840
How did I know that Ogihua was here?

185
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Does she still like adults after all these years?

186
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,000
Didn't you see her back as she left just now?

187
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,680
So lonely that it almost rains

188
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,000
It seems that I took less

189
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,320
One bottle is enough. The wine in the store is quite expensive.

190
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,560
landlady

191
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,320
Do you like Hyun Bae?

192
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,080
do you know

193
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,480
in everyone's heart

194
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,520
There are all extremely regrettable things

195
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,400
but something

196
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,080
No need to get to the bottom of things

197
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,480
Everyone has regrets in their heart

198
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,040
What about you? Do you have one too?

199
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,280
my brother is missing

200
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
I also found my brother

201
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,720
a long time

202
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,840
But I still can't find any trace of him

203
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,960
Someone told me that your brother has passed away.

204
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,560
Stop looking for it, but I don’t believe it

205
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
My brother is very good to me

206
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,000
We have been dependent on each other since childhood

207
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,800
I don't believe it

208
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,720
He will leave me alone

209
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,480
your brother

210
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,560
I've never heard you mention it

211
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,560
landlady

212
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,240
You've never mentioned it

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,080
Is it about you and Xuan Pei?

214
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,240
I know

215
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,760
Probably only

216
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,320
When the heart is seriously injured

217
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,160
Only then will I bury it deep in my heart

218
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,880
The deepest words are revealed

219
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
Don't say anything

220
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm afraid it's really hard for my heart to bear the load.

221
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,960
Do you like Tong Feng

222
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,560
turn out to be

223
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,240
It's really too late

224
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,520
this is not for you

225
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,760
Who is that for?

226
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,160
secret

227
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
This is what you eat

228
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,000
You can't blame me

229
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,920
Xuan Pei, why are you like this?

230
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,680
Still don't want to tell me

231
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,840
Who is it for?

232
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,960
not tell you

233
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,000
Tongfeng, where are you going?

234
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,760
Let me give something to Xiao Mencius

235
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,640
did you see her

236
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Little Mencius is in the room

237
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Then I'll go first. Bye bye.

238
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,120
Bye-Bye

239
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,520
It turns out that she came to see Meng Dihua

240
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,760
Little Mencius

241
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,560
Tongfeng

242
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,760
You are here to bring me food

243
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,600
you see

244
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,240
Still my favorite caramel strawberry

245
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,840
What can you do with your little clumsy hands?

246
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,440
Little Mencius

247
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,760
I heard Ma Yichun say

248
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,400
You to Xuan Pei

249
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
In fact, you don’t have to do this for Xuan Pei

250
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,280
I'm worried about you

251
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,040
Tongfeng

252
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,400
You and Xuan Pei have always been very good.

253
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,200
I can't find any reason to destroy you

254
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,400
If you because of this

255
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,800
To be alienated from me

256
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,480
That's what saddens me the most

257
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,600
How can I be alienated from you?

258
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,640
Tong Feng, listen to me
