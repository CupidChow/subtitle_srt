1
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,240
from the beginning

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,280
You and Xuan Pei are destined to be a couple

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,680
It was you who didn’t understand love in the past

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,040
Time wasted

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,360
Now that you understand

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,360
You should cherish your future life

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,400
if you still think

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,880
I miss the past

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,640
That's the good sister who underestimated you

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,160
Little Mencius

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,200
Tong Feng, you know

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,000
What is the most precious thing in the eyes of mortals?

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,600
is true love

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,440
Xu Jing spent his whole life proving this

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,760
It's true love, but the love between a man and a woman is true love

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,200
The love of friends is also true love

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,360
The golden wind and jade dew meet each other

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,400
It is not an encounter between a man and a woman

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,680
Only ability can defeat countless people in the world

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Not only is the meeting of a man and a woman true love

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,720
Our meeting was also true love

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,720
Silly girl

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,920
in my eyes

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,960
You have always been more important than Xuan Pei

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,120
Little Mencius

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,800
Okay, okay, don't cry, don't cry

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,600
OK

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
Let's see how the strawberries you made for me go.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
I knew you were like this

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,600
I would have told you earlier

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,920
Otherwise, I would have eaten this strawberry long ago.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,160
have a look

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,560
you see

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,480
It looks good

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,200
How about it

36
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,920
Have another bite

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,080
There are quite a few people here today

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,480
Brother Chun is here

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,880
What do you want from us, sir?

40
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,080
Who knows?

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,960
Your Excellency has been mysterious lately.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,920
Always smiling inexplicably

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,240
That person, sir

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,320
On the face of thousands of years

45
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,560
Not even a single smile can be seen

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,320
I've been smiling so much lately that my face is almost wet with honey.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
So scary

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,360
Speaking of this, I remember one thing

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,600
We adults have always acted vigorously and resolutely.

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Your Majesty never shows favoritism

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
That day I made an oversight

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,760
A stranger was mistakenly brought to Jiuyou

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,800
Should have been whipped

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,880
But not only did the adults not hit me,

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,160
He also asked me if I have been tired recently.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,720
look on face

57
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,840
I would call it gentle

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,320
The adults won't like me anymore, right?

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,760
You might as well have some face

60
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,920
Death, you said you are so narcissistic

61
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
How did you manage to live for thousands of years?

62
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,720
Haven't been beaten yet

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,120
I want to call us

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,360
It should be for

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,480
Jiuyou Talent Vocational Skills Competition and

66
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,920
The 2682nd Heaven and Demon Realm

67
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
Souvenir Exchange Conference

68
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
held

69
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,080
What is that?

70
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,800
It's possible that I didn't ask you to come after all.

71
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
It wouldn't be something so wise

72
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,520
Old man, what do you mean?

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,240
I have no wisdom

74
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,480
Just this little thing

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,880
You guys are discussing and discussing here.

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
Sir, come to us today

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Nine times out of ten, it’s for Tong Feng

78
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,640
Just think about this little thing

79
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,080
You guys really made it happen

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,040
Impossible, absolutely impossible

81
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,040
Is your lord such a person who misdirects government for the sake of beauty?

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,360
What if it is

83
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,920
in the case of

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,520
I will go to the mountains to plant

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,520
big big big adult

86
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,000
adult

87
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
That's the kind of person I am

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,800
What do you mean, sir?

89
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,880
i have a friend

90
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Wants to take the woman he likes out for fun

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,440
But he didn't know

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,840
What do women like nowadays?

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,720
I'll come to you to discuss it.

94
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,720
Sir, this friend you are talking about

95
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,360
Is it yourself?

96
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,720
Is this what women like nowadays?

97
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,600
It depends on which period the woman was from

98
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,840
Fly a kite and visit the lantern festival

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,360
The more fashionable ones like watching movies

100
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,400
do you think

101
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,760
Which girl does my friend like?

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Eat

103
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,520
Really eat

104
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,000
seconded

105
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,800
seconded

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,960
seconded

107
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,720
romantic

108
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,160
It turns out that my subject is actually

109
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,440
Such a person who doesn’t understand romance

110
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,600
that is

111
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
You are a bunch of singles

112
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,840
It's noisy here

113
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,960
Sir, listen to me

114
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,400
Watch movies

115
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,600
Newly opened theater in Jiuyou

116
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,280
The girl your friend likes must have never been there

117
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,760
This mortal man is dating a woman

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,920
usually choose one

119
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,640
movie called horror movie

120
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,040
In an eerie atmosphere

121
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,600
woman frightened

122
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,280
Usually hides in a man's arms

123
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,880
Won it in one fell swoop

124
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,480
These nine ghost souls

125
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,400
They all fell under the skirt of the nine-tailed fox

126
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
Sure enough, everything has its reason

127
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,160
Kyuubi must be an adult

128
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,760
Choose the scariest one for your grown-up friends

129
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,520
The movie that scares women the most

130
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,520
I don't want people waiting around in the theater

131
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,720
Can be reserved

132
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,760
Kyuubi wholeheartedly serves your friends

133
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,720
Kyuubi

134
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,920
Your promotion to the first rank minister of Jiuyou

135
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,600
Just around the corner

136
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,200
Thank you sir

137
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,320
It turns out this is a theater

138
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,720
Just like what I saw in the drama

139
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,560
This theater has no soul at all.

140
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,880
This theater just opened

141
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,920
So there is no soul

142
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,600
Popcorn

143
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,800
This is the legendary popcorn

144
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,520
Xuan Pei, what are you doing with a flower?

145
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,520
decorate

146
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,960
Tongfeng

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,840
This movie is a horror movie

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
if you feel scared

149
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,880
can tell me

150
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,720
Isn't it just a horror movie?

151
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,760
What's there to be afraid of?

152
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,000
Aren’t we the souls that mortals fear most?

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
I mean if

154
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,560
no if

155
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,440
It's started, it's started

156
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,040
If she doesn't play her cards normally

157
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,320
Then I have no choice but to feel wronged, Your Excellency.

158
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,360
your friend

159
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,640
It's okay, be good

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,280
These are all fake

161
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,080
Fake

162
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,000
Be good

163
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,800
We need to cut off that scary place quickly.

164
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Sir, Kyuubi’s hard work

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,520
Just take care of it

166
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,560
It's raining hard outside

167
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,520
yes

168
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,080
I just came back to tell you

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,920
Let you be careful

170
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,360
You came back specifically to save me

171
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
I still miss you so much

172
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,960
But why

173
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,160
Don't ask questions at this time

174
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
What are they doing?

175
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,200
This is all you need to know

176
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
This is just inconsistent with etiquette

177
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,240
But my heart is beating wildly

178
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,480
Tong Feng, don’t you think I’m in danger?

179
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,360
How can this be?

180
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,640
Where are you in danger?

181
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,080
I'm in danger everywhere

182
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
why are you here

183
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,280
Don't ask this kind of question at this time

184
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,080
didn't i tell you

185
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,640
Isn't this inconsistent with etiquette?

186
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,560
But I think it's inconsistent with etiquette

187
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,720
wake up

188
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Xuan Pei, I will be responsible for you

189
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,520
Why don't you sleep a little longer?

190
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,320
I have morning class today

191
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,680
Not going

192
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,280
No, today is Teacher Liu Taigong’s class

193
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,000
He will be angry if I don't go

194
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,200
Don't stay with me to sleep a little longer

195
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,600
What's the matter with you?

196
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,080
On weekdays, you hate me the most for skipping classes.

197
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,680
It's okay, I'll make up this lesson for you

198
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,080
But today is French class. Do you know how to do it?

199
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes, I know everything

200
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,640
Xuan Pei, do you still remember this ring?

201
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,600
When I was in the mortal world, I won for Wanwan.

202
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,280
I heard that it’s good for mortals to meet each other for a hundred years

203
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,520
They all exchange rings with each other

204
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,080
You and I last for thousands of years

205
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,640
There must also be a ring

206
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,040
Then you can have thousands of years

207
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
always be responsible for me

208
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,920
I will definitely be responsible for you

209
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,320
Then be responsible for me now

210
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,240
What is this three-world talent competition?

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,160
Taigong Liu didn't tell you

212
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,560
Is it about the Three Realms Talent Competition?

213
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,480
Three Realms Talent Competition

214
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,000
But it’s a once-in-a-thousand-year competition event in the three realms.

215
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,840
At that time, the heavenly clan

216
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,800
demon world demon clan

217
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,160
There are also nine ghost souls

218
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,680
All must compete together

219
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,760
Are there many people who want to win this three-world talent competition?

220
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,560
Of course

221
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,560
First place in the Three Realms Talent Competition

222
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,360
Get generous rewards

223
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,440
Generous rewards

224
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,680
I decided

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,480
I want to compete, I want to be first

226
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,880
Adult Jiuyou Talent Vocational Skills Competition

227
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,520
cum 2682nd session

228
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Held of the Heavenly Demon Realm Local Products Exchange Conference

229
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,040
It has come to an end successfully

230
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,440
This is a good job of seducing people and killing people.

231
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,560
Give them both a level up

232
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,040
The adults seem to be in a good mood recently

233
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,840
Is there any

234
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,680
Adults should still pay attention to their health

235
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,880
Don’t be addicted to women

236
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,880
Sleep, sleep, sleep, what did you do last night?

237
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,160
So sleepy

238
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,840
Liu Taigong

239
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,760
Just back off

240
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,920
I will lead this class

241
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,360
But this

242
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,560
Why did you make Teacher Liu angry again?

243
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,360
I just accidentally fell asleep

244
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,440
Xuan Pei, what are you doing here?

245
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,040
Didn't we agree?

246
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,040
I need to give you extra lessons

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,560
If Xuan Pei is giving me extra lessons

248
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,680
I woke up immediately

249
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,360
This French is so difficult

250
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,000
At the end of this lesson I teach you this sentence

251
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,680
What does this sentence mean?

252
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,280
that is

253
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,680
Do you like to eat my cooking?

254
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,080
So what should I say if I like it?

255
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,480
I'll teach you in the next class

256
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,800
My old bones really can't stand the torture.

257
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,480
If one day I die

258
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,560
please open my heart

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,520
You will see it written in gold letters

260
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,160
i still love you

261
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,600
Who is this?

262
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,360
In the words of Shakespeare

263
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,160
Too old-fashioned, too old-fashioned

264
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,440
I'm not good at cooking. I have to learn more from you.

265
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,680
You are so lucky, sir.

266
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,240
Let's go to my room

267
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,600
I recently learned some new fashionable pastries

268
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,120
Just one more hour would be fine

269
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,440
You deserve Tongfeng takeout

270
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,040
Xuan Pei, if you miss me

271
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,040
Just use the Thousand Miles Telephone Mirror to find me.

272
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,520
Thousand Miles Telephone Mirror

273
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,720
Xuan Pei

274
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,600
What kind of soup are you making?

275
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,440
I just learned how to stew pear with rock sugar

276
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,400
Are you in class?

277
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,160
Yes, today is Teacher Liu Taigong’s class

278
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,560
I don't dare skip class anymore

279
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,440
That's it, then you should go to class well.

280
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,960
Bye-Bye

281
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,720
I need to tell you something about this lesson

282
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,480
Things about the preliminary round of the Three Realms Talent Competition
