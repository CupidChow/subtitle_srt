00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:09,018
Lee Je Hoon

2
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,539
Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,819
Jang Hyeok Jin, Bae Yu Ram, Shin Jae Ha

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,060
Taxi Driver 2

5
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,739
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,338
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:34,860
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:36,259
Get him up.

9
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,218
Wait.

10
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,138
At least tell me why I'm getting kicked out.

11
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:42,139
Why?

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,299
Are you sure we shouldn't go and help?

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,699
Why aren't the police doing anything when they're seeing all this?

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,899
Will you hold onto him?

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,259
- Gosh, that hurt. - Get up.

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,299
Oh, dear. I'm dying over here.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,939
Will someone call the police?

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,020
Come here.

19
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,459
Come here. Hey.

20
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,259
Hello. You can come in.

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,619
- Who asked for us? - Hey.

22
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,179
He made the report.

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
Are you okay?

24
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,258
Are you okay? Can you stand up?

25
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,509
Oh, dear.

26
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,538
Stand up. Are you all right?

27
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:24,619
Let's see.

28
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:26,539
Hey.

29
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:28,339
What are you doing?

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,819
You're under arrest for obstructing a business.

31
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:36,539
What the heck is going on?

32
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,939
If you have no other issues, we'll head back.

33
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,940
Take care.

34
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,818
I saw it go down myself and I can't believe it.

35
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,898
- Let's go. - Wait. No.

36
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,698
What? We're not going to follow him?

37
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:03,898
Let me check one thing.

38
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,699
What? Check what?

39
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,059
To check why that private ambulance is stopping at the club.

40
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,859
Ambulance

41
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,940
What's this?

42
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,060
Did someone get hurt inside?

43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,539
Come on.

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,379
What is this?

45
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,738
- Let's go. - Let go of me.

46
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:29,219
- My blood isn't circulating. - What is this?

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,379
- Why are you doing this? - Come on.

48
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,660
Seriously. I'm here to have fun.

49
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:35,259
Black Sun

50
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,979
Mom.

51
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,910
Put them in the truck.

52
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,859
I'm going. Don't push me.

53
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,499
I'm going to sue you guys. You're not getting away with this.

54
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,060
How could you let in minors?

55
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:00,739
Hey.

56
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,619
I told you no minors in the club. Didn't I?

57
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,698
You did.

58
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,460
If you knew that, how could you let those kids in?

59
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,940
They bought the high pass from an agent.

60
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,299
The high pass?

61
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,380
- Which agent? - It was Windy.

62
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,620
Gosh. She must be desperate for money.

63
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,220
Let's wipe her board.

64
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,939
Pull the plug on her entire schedule.

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,979
Yes, sir.

66
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,620
She's desperate for money. But he's going to wipe her board?

67
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,900
What's this about?

68
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,699
Do you want a drink?

69
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,620
Have you gone mad?

70
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,099
How dare you cancel my reservations?

71
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,539
How dare you?

72
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,259
You must be out of your mind after losing all your customers.

73
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,339
Do you know how much money I lost today?

74
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,419
I don't.

75
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,179
But you put me in a tight spot because you carelessly...

76
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,738
let some minors in.

77
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:09,739
Minor: Underage customers

78
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,699
Shouldn't you kneel and apologize to me first?

79
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,298
That's why you pulled out all of my reservations?

80
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:15,579
You lowlife!

81
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,269
Didn't I make it clear to you?

82
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,019
Rape or assault. People can do whatever they want here...

83
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,858
because we can easily say the customers got too excited.

84
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:27,739
But we can't do anything about minors.

85
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,779
Get your hands off me, you lowlife.

86
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,709
If we get caught serving minors,

87
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,619
there's no way out.

88
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,059
I'll go down for everything.

89
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:38,619
Darn it!

90
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,619
You crazy wench. Gosh. Come on.

91
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
Darn it.

92
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,059
Do you want to die?

93
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,660
I'm going to kill you first, you lowlife.

94
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,059
Sir.

95
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:58,939
Chief.

96
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,660
Chief of Black Sun, Yoo Moon Hyun

97
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,379
- What are you two doing? - It's nothing.

98
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,460
We were talking.

99
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:11,379
Talking, my foot.

100
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:12,739
We still have customers here.

101
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,378
If you need to talk, do it quietly after we close.

102
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,498
Yes, sir.

103
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,419
I was on my way out to get back to work.

104
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,710
Gosh. That idiot.

105
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,710
Gosh.

106
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:29,580
Darn it.

107
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:34,979
Hey, Detective Jang. It's me.

108
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:36,820
Hey.

109
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,178
Detective Jang Jin Ho of Jeongsam Police Station

110
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:41,059
Stop making up stories...

111
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,019
and don't destroy what isn't yours.

112
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,178
Senior Officer Jo Min Geon

113
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:47,058
You don't believe me that I reported I saw minors,

114
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:49,900
but you believe club security who said I destroyed property.

115
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,618
Without even going inside the club.

116
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,019
Criminal Division, Violent Crimes Team 1

117
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,100
Hey.

118
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,419
Is your name Kim Do Gi?

119
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Cell 1

120
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:07,979
You're now under arrest for molesting a club employee.

121
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,418
You should've just had a good time.

122
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,739
Why cause a fuss and bother so many people?

123
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,379
You're well and truly screwed.

124
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,619
Taxi Driver 2

125
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,579
Episode 12

126
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,660
Gosh. Their nicknames are making it harder for me to identify them.

127
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:39,579
Who on earth reported Mr. Kim?

128
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,499
Just wait until I find you.

129
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,979
What?

130
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,179
What's he doing here?

131
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,140
What are you doing here?

132
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:11,179
What is it?

133
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,140
Gosh.

134
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,059
Darn it.

135
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,059
Jeongsam Police Station

136
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:41,260
What? Come on.

137
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:50,220
Shouldn't you at least thank me?

138
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,660
I don't remember hearing that from you either.

139
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,580
You actually cursed at me.

140
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,780
Keep the country safe with the people.

141
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:05,299
If you want this, buy me a beer.

142
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,820
Gosh. That hits the spot.

143
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,939
Gosh. You know how to take a punch.

144
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,580
That would have been enough to knock you out.

145
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,859
I don't think I want this video.

146
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,940
Keep watching.

147
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,310
Stop.

148
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,430
The woman who just got out of the taxi.

149
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,619
She made the false report that you sexually harassed her.

150
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,659
Her name is Aena.

151
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,430
She's an agent at the club.

152
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,978
But she came to work after you got arrested.

153
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,580
So it's obvious she was lying.

154
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:10,700
That's why you were released right away.

155
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
Cheers.

156
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,778
By the way, how could you even think about tipping off...

157
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,939
the police regarding the minors inside the club?

158
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,429
Gosh. Are you that fearless?

159
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,979
Or are you that confident?

160
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:29,189
Reporters don't usually get beaten up...

161
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,139
that badly on the rooftop.

162
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,379
I never told you I was a reporter.

163
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,820
They called you a media jackal.

164
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,060
I see.

165
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,139
Why were you filming them on the rooftop...

166
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,310
when they were beating you up?

167
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,859
I guess I did it to extort money. I'm a media jackal.

168
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,778
If that was your goal,

169
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,139
you would've done it at the entrance.

170
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,499
There would be witnesses all over the entrance.

171
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:07,100
You probably didn't want anyone interrupting you.

172
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:08,499
Like...

173
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,580
the police.

174
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,060
Were you filming yourself getting beaten up,

175
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,460
so you could threaten them?

176
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,019
Or...

177
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:22,859
was it to cut a deal?

178
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,139
I don't know what you're trying to do here,

179
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,859
but you should stay away from Black Sun.

180
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,859
This isn't a threat. It's a word of advice for you.

181
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,778
You experienced it firsthand, right?

182
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,979
How your kindness of tipping off the police panned out.

183
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,310
You see,

184
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:48,619
common sense has no place at Black Sun.

185
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,430
So you should stop before you hurt yourself.

186
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,310
If you keep hanging around there, you'll be getting in my way.

187
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,100
Anyway, thanks for the beer.

188
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:17,499
Tiger Beer

189
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,138
Anyway, you dodged a bullet.

190
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,978
Whatever his intention was, without Mr. Kim Yong Min's help,

191
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,619
you would have been in big trouble.

192
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,659
But don't you think this is ridiculous?

193
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,699
I can't believe that...

194
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,540
the police showed up at the club because he sent in a tip.

195
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,300
They framed me to get me in trouble.

196
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:43,019
And they were about to push a reporter off the rooftop.

197
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,739
They didn't hesitate at all.

198
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:48,420
This also proves that Black Sun must have a lot to hide.

199
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,420
Why don't we get the club owner and interrogate him?

200
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,340
Let me give you a pop quiz.

201
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,899
Guess how many people own the club.

202
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:58,699
Isn't there only one owner?

203
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,739
Wrong.

204
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,460
A, 2 people. B, 3 people.

205
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,738
C, four people.

206
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:05,258
D, 5 people. E, 6 people.

207
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,300
E.

208
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:11,619
Gosh. You're really good at questions like this.

209
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,139
That was correct.

210
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,580
She never changes. She's so consistent.

211
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,659
But do you know what's even more shocking?

212
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,179
All six of them aren't real owners.

213
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,540
They are just figureheads.

214
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,340
So no one knows who the real owner is?

215
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,059
That's odd.

216
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,940
Black Sun

217
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,060
I need to get back into Black Sun.

218
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,618
Should I book a table?

219
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:39,619
No.

220
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,060
The range of the areas I can cover as a customer is limited.

221
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,859
It'll be better to use another method to get back in.

222
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,738
I would have been in big trouble without your help,

223
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:57,259
Senior Superintendent.

224
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,778
Gosh, I told you not to call me that here.

225
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,579
Park Hyun Jo, the owner of Black Sun

226
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,499
Senior Superintendent of Seoul Metropolitan Police

227
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,060
Yes, sir.

228
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:11,540
Just call a chauffeur when after drinking.

229
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,658
A DUI in the middle of the road? That's just so embarrassing.

230
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:17,460
Actually, I already told Hoon Jung. I made myself clear.

231
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,859
I told him we wouldn't help him with his next DUI.

232
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:21,499
By the way, Senior Superintendent...

233
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,619
Sir.

234
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:27,498
To celebrate the release of my new album,

235
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:29,220
I'm planning to rent the entire resort...

236
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,540
on an island and throw a party.

237
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:32,259
You're coming, right?

238
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,979
Will there be pretty celebrities?

239
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,139
You know, I'm into models these days.

240
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,700
I know your type.

241
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,619
I'll invite models who aren't so shy.

242
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,619
I saw an article about your new relationship.

243
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,498
What? With who?

244
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:53,619
You don't even know whom you've been fooling around?

245
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,300
Gosh. I don't know.

246
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,220
I just fool around with everyone.

247
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,019
Then I'll marry a foreigner. Right.

248
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
Gosh.

249
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,180
The settlement for this month is finished.

250
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:13,018
I can just check the number on the bottom.

251
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,138
Sales revenue, 5.64 million dollars

252
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:15,139
Gosh.

253
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,379
Monthly Sales Revenue Chart

254
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:19,179
Victor, after you promoted the club,

255
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,259
we've been hitting new sales records every month.

256
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,540
This isn't just a club to me.

257
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,060
I should do everything I can.

258
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,820
Then I'll put you down on the list for my party.

259
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,659
I'll set it up and make it gorgeous too.

260
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,899
To success.

261
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,460
Cheers!

262
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,499
Club Black Sun

263
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,460
Club Black Sun

264
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,259
Black Sun

265
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,300
- Did you call a taxi? - Yes, it will be here soon.

266
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,259
Rainbow Taxi has arrived.

267
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,540
- Gosh. - Goodness.

268
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,700
Deluxe

269
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,219
You're the Head of Security. What did you do to the guys?

270
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,259
Why did everyone go AWOL?

271
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,460
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,859
They couldn't properly handle a media jackal the other day.

273
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,940
I told them to leave.

274
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,300
But I didn't know they would all leave at the same time.

275
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,619
You still have a lot to learn.

276
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:11,060
I'm on my way there. Pick out some guys.

277
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:13,940
Get me strong ones. I don't want any softies.

278
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,180
Gosh. Darn it.

279
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,220
No pain, no gain.

280
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,378
Kids these days don't know...

281
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:36,300
the first thing about being professional.

282
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,420
I'm sorry, sir. The guys in the last batch were decent.

283
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
That's odd.

284
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,300
Send me the address of the guys that went AWOL.

285
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:44,779
I must teach them a lesson...

286
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,899
about the consequence of being irresponsible.

287
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,940
Well, since we only made the introductions,

288
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,379
we didn't ask for their addresses.

289
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,060
I don't know where they live.

290
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,019
Hey.

291
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,340
Why do you think I hired you?

292
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,659
I'm paying you to filter out the bad apples.

293
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,270
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,458
I'll find the ones who quit without handing in their notice...

295
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,750
and beat them up.

296
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,859
Gosh.

297
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,219
Please don't be so upset. We have a lot of good guys today.

298
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:19,939
Have your pick.

299
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,020
Hey. Move.

300
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,990
I'm not done yet.

301
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:29,699
That's your problem.

302
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,100
We need to use this machine. So beat it.

303
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,340
I told you I wasn't done yet.

304
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,379
Look at this rude jerk.

305
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,750
Hey.

306
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,340
Those punks.

307
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,540
- Wait. - Gosh.

308
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,540
Come on.

309
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,539
Everyone here should be polite and have some manners.

310
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
And...

311
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,699
Wait for your turn.

312
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,659
wait for your turn.

313
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,820
No pain, no gain.

314
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,990
Make yourself stronger.

315
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,859
Gosh.

316
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,419
It's time for my protein drink.

317
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Who is that?

318
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:39,138
He served time in the same cell as Woo Sik.

319
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,179
Woo Sik told him about us.

320
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:44,269
This is good.

321
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,340
What was he in for?

322
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:46,540
Assault.

323
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,580
He just got here. So I don't know much about him.

324
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,939
Thugs have a naive side too.

325
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,419
He seems naive...

326
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,139
to a fault.

327
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,510
Come in.

328
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,139
Did you want to see me?

329
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,060
Take them and train them.

330
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,540
Yes, sir. Thank you.

331
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,899
Hey. You jerk.

332
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:31,699
What? Do you know him?

333
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,990
He's the one who reported the cops about the minors.

334
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,859
What?

335
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,300
Look at this law-abiding citizen.

336
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,820
Who knew I would run into you here?

337
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,510
You managed to weasel your way out of that.

338
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:47,020
I'm sorry about that.

339
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,899
I got too worked up that day.

340
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,750
Actually, I briefly worked at a convenience store.

341
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:56,059
A lot of minors came to the store to lie to us about their age...

342
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,659
to buy liquor and cigarettes.

343
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,340
I got burned many times.

344
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:02,899
I used up all of my salary for the settlement money.

345
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:05,059
So after that, whenever I see these kids...

346
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,060
who don't have basic ethics and lie about their age,

347
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:08,510
I lose my temper.

348
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,540
I reported it to the police right away.

349
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,510
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,099
You and your lame excuses.

351
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,138
Thinking about all the trouble I went through because of you...

352
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:20,139
Good job.

353
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,750
If you spot minors again, report it again.

354
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:27,139
But not to the cops.

355
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:29,379
To me.

356
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Yes, sir.

357
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Go.

358
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Yes, sir.

359
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,459
I'll do my best!

360
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:50,510
His basic attitude is good.

361
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:56,659
- Hello, sir. - Hey.

362
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,459
Let's get acquainted later.

363
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,100
Come here. Go.

364
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,459
Hurry.

365
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:04,139
Attention.

366
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,418
Here are the four areas of business we must handle at the club.

367
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:09,989
Watching the hall, managing the entrance,

368
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,820
marking VIPs, and making deliveries.

369
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Hey.

370
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
As for the newbies,

371
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:18,270
marking VIPs and making deliveries are above your pay grade.

372
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:20,300
When you watch the hall,

373
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:23,059
don't get involved even if customers get drunk and start fighting...

374
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,100
or flirting with each other.

375
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:26,139
If things get serious,

376
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:28,939
then kick out only the guys, not girls. Got it?

377
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,059
Easy, right?

378
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,060
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

379
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,750
Bouncers at the entrance.

380
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,659
Keeping the water clean is solely up to you.

381
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,510
I'll teach you how it's done, so keep the rules in mind.

382
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:41,270
Once we open for the day,

383
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:43,580
all women are allowed in unless they're super ugly.

384
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,509
But with men, don't accept anyone...

385
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,300
who look too old or are dressed like college kids.

386
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,379
What if they booked a room but they're not dressed well?

387
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:52,819
Let them in if they're VIP.

388
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,499
If not, ban them from entering. Got it?

389
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,580
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

390
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,260
If the club gets crowded, purify the quality of our guests.

391
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,259
Women who are hippos and pigs should be banned at the door.

392
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,540
Being with a model friend won't balance it out.

393
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,618
As for men, if they don't seem rich or stylish,

394
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,060
ban them from entering.

395
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,659
And then midnight strikes.

396
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,619
That's when the club is at its peak hour.

397
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:20,060
Boom.

398
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:22,780
Only male VIP guests will be allowed to enter.

399
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:25,859
As for women, they must at least be like fashion models.

400
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,219
If you're not sure about someone, come to me.

401
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,858
We're responsible for everything that goes on at Black Sun.

402
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,539
We are Black Sun.

403
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,820
We mark the beginning and end of this club.

404
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,179
Have pride in your job. Got it?

405
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,820
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

406
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,939
You mark the beginning and end?

407
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,219
Do you see yourselves as deities?

408
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,219
What did you just say?

409
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,020
Goodness. Did I say that out loud?

410
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,899
Guard Jang, your hearing is too good for your own good.

411
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:57,699
I'd expect that from a dog.

412
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,619
Who are you glaring at, you moron?

413
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,500
You still haven't come to your senses.

414
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,100
Oh, dear.

415
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,899
Maybe you need to be wiped out more.

416
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:17,780
Don't you dare.

417
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:20,580
I'll snag all bottles in every room.

418
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:23,939
I'll keep at it.

419
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:29,419
That brat.

420
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:31,899
Why are you still standing there?

421
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,020
Go to your positions and get ready to open!

422
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:37,378
The newbies will clean the tables.

423
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:38,740
Hey, you. Clean up around here.

424
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:41,458
Hurry up, guys. Move!

425
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:43,939
No. 9

426
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:03,540
- What the... - Hey!

427
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,100
My gosh!

428
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:10,859
Hey, Number Nine. Where do you think you're going?

429
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,740
Do you want to get beaten up?

430
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:14,139
Keep this in mind.

431
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,459
You're a carp with human eyes.

432
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,579
You know how carps are.

433
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,100
Whatever you see, you'll forget instantly. Got it?

434
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,378
Sure.

435
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,099
Don't meddle...

436
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,540
and ruin the mood.

437
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,580
Got it, sir.

438
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,379
By the way,

439
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,540
where is the chief's office?

440
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,179
You punk.

441
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,379
Why do you want to know that?

442
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:41,499
Because the chief told me...

443
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,619
to report back to him if there are any issues.

444
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:47,899
Is the chief actually the owner of this club?

445
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
From the get-go,

446
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:51,658
you're trying to score points with the man upstairs.

447
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,859
- Maybe I should teach you a lesson. - What's going on?

448
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,419
Greetings, ma'am.

449
00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:01,060
Didn't you say you weren't a guard?

450
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,060
I am one at the moment.

451
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Welcome.

452
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,780
No. 9

453
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,859
The Small Bookstore in My Hand

454
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:31,659
The Small Bookstore in My Hand

455
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,980
I haven't been able to locate the office within the club.

456
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,619
Maybe there isn't one.

457
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,979
To do the bookkeeping,

458
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,419
one will need an office.

459
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,658
Many of the CCTV cameras get broken out here,

460
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,060
so they'll need a room for servers as well.

461
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,618
The office remains hidden...

462
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:51,659
because they have a lot of things to hide.

463
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,139
I'll keep looking.

464
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:00,458
Look at him slacking off.

465
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,020
That from a newbie?

466
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:07,139
It seems as though he's coming our way.

467
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:10,219
- Have a good day. - Sure.

468
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
What now?

469
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:23,060
What did I say about setting up shop here?

470
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:25,099
Don't you understand Korean?

471
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,740
Why won't you take me seriously?

472
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:28,059
Take it elsewhere!

473
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,618
There's no need to be mean.

474
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:30,939
- You. - Hey, sir.

475
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:34,019
I told them to pack up and move...

476
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,139
since they were blocking the guests' parking space.

477
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:38,300
But they just won't listen.

478
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,780
What is all this anyway?

479
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:41,019
When did you set this up?

480
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,259
Misters, you can't sell books here.

481
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,459
Take it elsewhere.

482
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,339
Having fun at the club...

483
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,780
will leave people hungry.

484
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:51,458
Books feed the heart,

485
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,340
and nothing is healthier than reading.

486
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:56,500
Mister.

487
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:58,500
Take it elsewhere.

488
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,458
Sure. Elsewhere?

489
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:04,979
- We'll pack this up. Sorry. - Right.

490
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,340
Give us some time.

491
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,020
He looks nasty, doesn't he?

492
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,139
- Hey. - Yes?

493
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,540
By the way, how do you know Ms. Yang?

494
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:22,020
Who exactly is Ms. Yang?

495
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:25,939
Look at you putting on a show.

496
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,499
Someone who doesn't know you...

497
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:33,219
couldn't possibly have remembered your number.

498
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:38,219
There's something about you that annoys me.

499
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,780
Follow me.

500
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:00,219
Listen up.

501
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,939
You'll now be in charge of marking the VIP guests.

502
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,500
But your main focus isn't the people.

503
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,259
Your main job is to protect the bottle...

504
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,060
that corresponds with your name tag.

505
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:10,699
No. 3

506
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:14,979
No. 6

507
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,379
If the bottle gets robbed or ends up broken,

508
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:19,459
you'll pay.

509
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,060
Go. Protect your bottle.

510
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,060
Got it.

511
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:19,780
Here we go.

512
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,458
- Here you go. - Thanks.

513
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:32,459
- Let's get drunk. - I'm already tipsy.

514
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,699
Over here. Let's party.

515
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:40,300
This is insane!

516
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:52,659
Where are you? What's taking you so long?

517
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:58,260
Club Black Sun

518
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,820
My work got pushed back, so I had to stay longer.

519
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,419
I just parked my car.

520
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,939
I was bored, so I ordered the most expensive bottle.

521
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:06,980
The one who arrives late should pay, right?

522
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:10,219
Of course. Order whatever you want.

523
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,419
Black Sun

524
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,580
Hey, get over here.

525
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
Get over here!

526
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,619
You.

527
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,980
Is professional courtesy a foreign concept to you?

528
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:45,780
I haven't been able to be recognized by Ms. Yang myself.

529
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,260
Who are you anyway?

530
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,060
Guard Jang allowed it.

531
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:54,698
Wait a second. Is someone watching your back?

532
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:58,340
You should've rejected his offer.

533
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,100
Have you received a tip from her?

534
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:02,379
I haven't.

535
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:03,619
Really?

536
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:06,899
Then, I'll tend to her instead.

537
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,379
You go around the back and make the delivery.

538
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,780
Stay sharp, okay?

539
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:14,859
Sure.

540
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,300
Darn it.

541
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:54,179
Gosh. Hold on.

542
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:01,138
What the... Why are you out here?

543
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:04,458
I was ordered to make the delivery.

544
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:06,378
I'm tired as it is.

545
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:07,379
Do you have a driver's license?

546
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,980
I do.

547
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,698
Here. Get behind the wheel.

548
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:13,780
Club Black Sun

549
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:03,939
Are you sure this bottle is yours to guard?

550
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:06,139
Yes, ma'am. I'm the one.

551
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,780
That's weird.

552
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,859
Maybe I saw the wrong number.

553
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:11,219
I'm not in the mood anymore.

554
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:34,980
Is the bishop still on a pilgrimage?

555
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:37,179
That's right.

556
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,138
But he ordered us...

557
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:41,379
to tend to you with the utmost care.

558
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,179
That being said, how about we entertain you...

559
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:47,379
with a game of snag the bottle?

560
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:49,379
Only there being a wager could make it entertaining.

561
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,300
Then we'll wager.

562
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,659
The winner gets a wish.

563
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,859
As long as it's something I can do, your wish will be my command.

564
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:02,260
Whose bottle is this? Number four.

565
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:04,379
Ma'am.

566
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,219
Where's Number Five?

567
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,939
Manager On, who will you bet on?

568
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,259
Sir.

569
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,259
These three will make a team,

570
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,619
and their opponent will be me.

571
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:33,819
No way! I'm already entertained.

572
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,739
Ms. Yang, who would you like to bet on?

573
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:40,060
I believe in you, Manager On,

574
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:42,060
but then it won't be as fun.

575
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,179
I'll bet on the other three.

576
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,219
If you win, you can share this.

577
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,540
How's that for motivation?

578
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,179
You're the best!

579
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,219
Darn it.

580
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:45,940
My goodness. You're the best.

581
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:56,259
These should be reset.

582
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,219
I can't believe it.

583
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,339
Could you be sexier?

584
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,299
As promised,

585
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,699
you will grant me a wish.

586
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:07,339
Of course.

587
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:08,659
Here you go.

588
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,219
Let me pour you a victory drink.

589
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:34,500
Sirs, where exactly are we going?

590
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:36,460
Just follow the navigation system.

591
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,259
We're late, so speed up.

592
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:42,459
Got it.

593
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,739
Grand L Hotel

594
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,778
They seem to be headed to a hotel.

595
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:50,060
Navigation Hacking

596
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,699
What does he mean by being late for a delivery?

597
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:15,339
34R 3535

598
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,298
Go Eun, license plate 34R 3535.

599
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:22,540
Run the car.

600
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:24,940
Did you say 34R 3535?

601
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,940
Car Registration

602
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:30,940
He's Kim Yong Min, the reporter.

603
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:50,298
Why are you going this way?

604
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,298
I think we're being tailed.

605
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:53,299
What?

606
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:02,259
What the...

607
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:16,540
Is he out of his mind? That darn reporter is back.

608
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,020
Why you...

609
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:18,909
- Get him. - Get out here, you punk.

610
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:21,299
What the...

611
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:42,020
Why are you...

612
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,819
She must be taken to a hospital.

613
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:49,500
We can't waste more time!

614
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:07,659
We'll have the results in about ten minutes.

615
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:09,619
Sure.

616
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:19,179
Taewon General Hospital

617
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:30,619
You're probably tired, so have one.

618
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,259
We'll have to wait a while.

619
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:38,980
I didn't expect to see you there.

620
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,699
Why were you with them?

621
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,060
I should ask you the same thing.

622
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:47,778
Wasn't I clear though?

623
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,059
I told you to stay out of it.

624
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,619
That's what I should be saying.

625
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,299
This is a reagent testing they're doing, right?

626
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:58,139
I can't be certain,

627
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:01,869
but my guess is that she was exposed to a drug.

628
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:04,778
Should I tell you what would've happened to her...

629
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:06,619
had I not interrupted?

630
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:10,060
She would've been taken to someplace...

631
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,020
only to be gruesomely violated.

632
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,389
She could call the police, but nothing will come out of it.

633
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,739
She might even be charged with framing an innocent.

634
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,818
What's your relationship to the patient inside?

635
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,389
Do you have the test result?

636
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:29,460
Her blood tested positive for drugs.

637
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,178
I knew it.

638
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:33,869
I have already called the police.

639
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:35,179
You called it in?

640
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,258
How can you report it without discussing it with me?

641
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:42,219
We're obligated to contact the police...

642
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:44,178
when blood tests positive for drugs.

643
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:45,979
When did you make the call?

644
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,658
The moment her test came back positive,

645
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:48,869
so they will be here any second.

646
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,819
Darn it.

647
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:04,779
Ambulance Entrance

648
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,179
Can you hear me?

649
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,868
You have been charged with violation of drug regulations.

650
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,819
You may remain silent... Can you hear me?

651
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,339
- What? - Get her in the car.

652
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:43,940
I was so close.

653
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:00,259
Mr. Kim.

654
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:03,699
Mr. Choi said they're about to wake up.

655
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:05,739
Okay, I'll be right there.

656
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,779
My head aches.

657
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:20,778
What happened?

658
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:23,060
Where's the woman? Where is she?

659
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:24,339
Shoot.

660
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,980
Wake up. Get up!

661
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:33,219
- Where are we? - Where'd the girl go?

662
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:35,139
Sirs.

663
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,460
- Are you all right? - That punk.

664
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,940
Call it in and give an update.

665
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,500
My head hurts.

666
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,060
Who is it?

667
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:03,819
Hey.

668
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,060
Where'd you get my address?

669
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,540
I was hoping for a cup of tea.

670
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,339
If you don't mind.

671
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,060
Hallucinosis, Sexual assault

672
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:29,739
No. 0

673
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:31,979
Black Sun

674
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,580
Jeongsam Police Station Jurisdiction

675
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:39,219
Detective Suicide Over Gambling Debt

676
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:45,339
I don't have tea. There's just beer or water.

677
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:47,179
Take your pick.

678
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,860
You can't actually be here for tea.

679
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,739
I want to know what it is you want.

680
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,339
What do you want to get at the risk of getting in trouble...

681
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,860
when you're a poor driver?

682
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,060
Let me ask you something first.

683
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,059
That night, when you drove into me and pushed my car.

684
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,739
Did you do that on purpose because I was in the truck's way?

685
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,259
To save me?

686
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,380
I'm a better driver than you.

687
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,500
I see.

688
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:38,540
What it is I want... What do I want?

689
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:42,139
I think there was a long list.

690
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,980
They all failed.

691
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:47,619
I ruined it all.

692
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,540
And someone died, because of me.

693
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,540
Black Sun's location

694
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,179
Choi Seong Eun.

695
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,939
He's one of the few honest officers I know.

696
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,940
Detective Suicide Over Gambling Debt

697
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,658
Suffocated Man in 30s Was Police Officer

698
00:46:08,659 --> 00:46:09,699
Choi Seong Eun

699
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:13,339
That man who took his own life?

700
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,900
He didn't kill himself.

701
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,580
Someone killed him...

702
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:22,739
and made it look like a suicide.

703
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,580
It was staged?

704
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:28,139
I don't know.

705
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:33,460
I thought I'd almost gotten to the bottom of it.

706
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:36,659
Last year,

707
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:41,860
if only I hadn't told Detective Choi what I knew.

708
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:46,939
1 year ago

709
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,338
We already know where to go.

710
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:49,859
- Make sure to... - Hello, sir.

711
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,218
sort this out for me.

712
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:54,138
Listen up. To congratulate us on the huge bust,

713
00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:56,659
the commissioner sent over a bonus.

714
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:58,979
- Yes! - Great!

715
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,738
- You, the youngster. - Yes, sir.

716
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:03,459
The commissioner wants a list in order of contribution,

717
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,178
- so type one up. - Yes, sir.

718
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:06,218
Good job, everyone.

719
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:07,900
- Thank you! - Thank you!

720
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:10,939
Hey, was this due today?

721
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,019
Yes.

722
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,699
- Can you do it? - Sure.

723
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,299
What is it now?

724
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,618
Congratulations.

725
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:23,178
You busted a huge Incheon drug smuggling gang.

726
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,059
Good for you.

727
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,019
You found about 20kg?

728
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,258
How do you know that? You're quick.

729
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:31,059
You might get on the first page.

730
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,298
Thanks for the kimchi.

731
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:34,218
My wife told me to thank you too.

732
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,259
Did she?

733
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,539
My mom made me way too much and I didn't know what to do.

734
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,698
I'm glad you liked it.

735
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:41,539
Stop beating around the bush.

736
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,739
You have a tip. What is it?

737
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,138
If it turns out to be huge, I get the exclusive.

738
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:50,460
When did you not?

739
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,138
Let's see. Drugs.

740
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:55,338
Black Sun Tip, Large-scale drug distribution

741
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,059
I staked out the place for a few days after I got the tip.

742
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,100
I sense something.

743
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:01,459
Use your common sense.

744
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,099
Why would a club that makes...

745
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,979
millions a month need to sell drugs?

746
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,100
That's why I'm here, to ask you to find out.

747
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,298
I think it's a dud.

748
00:48:10,299 --> 00:48:12,259
If it is, then it's a good thing.

749
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:15,298
Take this with you when you check the place out.

750
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:18,259
Press this button once, like this.

751
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:19,819
What's this?

752
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,618
I need at least a recording...

753
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:24,178
if I'm to negotiate a deadline.

754
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:25,579
I'll hold onto the story,

755
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,420
then print it when you give the okay.

756
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,380
And buy you a drink.

757
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:33,420
Yong Min. I won't do this for the drink.

758
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,460
I'll go because you say the place could be dirty.

759
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,699
- For justice. - Quit bothering me and go.

760
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,940
Take care.

761
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,059
Criminal Division

762
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,860
Detective Choi

763
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:57,460
- Hello? - Yong Min.

764
00:48:58,219 --> 00:48:59,338
You were right.

765
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:01,459
Why are you calling me this late?

766
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,540
I just don't know what to do.

767
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:07,059
What is it? What's up?

768
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,139
Black Sun

769
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,579
Where are you? I'll come over.

770
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,020
No, don't. I'll come to you.

771
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:21,060
You're the only one I can trust right now.

772
00:49:23,299 --> 00:49:24,619
Let me check one more thing.

773
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:30,139
No, wait. Hello? Detective Choi. Seong Eun!

774
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,739
Him saying he wanted to check one more thing.

775
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,219
It sounded so ominous.

776
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:39,980
And that bad feeling...

777
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,179
came true.

778
00:49:55,219 --> 00:49:56,219
Seong Eun.

779
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:01,739
Seong Eun.

780
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,618
Internal Affairs said...

781
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,819
Detective Choi had taken out loans from here and there.

782
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,500
Forensics released their initial findings.

783
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,500
It looks like suicide.

784
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,060
May the deceased rest in peace.

785
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:18,980
Don't lie.

786
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:23,219
Why would Detective Choi kill himself?

787
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,900
He got killed.

788
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,499
Wasn't he murdered while looking for the truth?

789
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,459
Reporter Kim, watch what you say in front of his family.

790
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,339
Are you sure you're teammates?

791
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,739
Did you investigate properly?

792
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,580
Jeongsam Police Station

793
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:45,860
Seong Eun was killed wrongfully.

794
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:49,739
I'll prove it.

795
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,940
Detective Choi...

796
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,618
was a valued colleague.

797
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,339
If we find anything fishy,

798
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,980
I'll reopen the investigation myself.

799
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,020
He left and drove off on his own.

800
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:12,219
We checked everything before informing his family.

801
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:13,899
So we don't do what you did...

802
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,138
and spew nonsense when you don't have the facts.

803
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,580
The case was closed today.

804
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,540
Don't you go digging into it.

805
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,579
That's a joke.

806
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,500
If you can't do it,

807
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,739
I'll do it on my own.

808
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:29,500

Detective Choi Seong Eun Suicide

810
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:35,020
When they concluded Seung Eun's death as a suicide,

811
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:38,060
a few detectives requested another investigation.

812
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:41,818
And strangely enough, they got transferred elsewhere.

813
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:44,219
Detective Choi Seong Eun Suicide

814
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,580
Supposedly took his life

818
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,859
Take this with you.

819
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,779
Press this button once, like this.

820
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:28,299
What's this?

821
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:30,138
I need at least a recording...

822
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:32,659
if I'm to negotiate a deadline.

823
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,900
The pen recorder I gave him.

824
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,460
Detective Choi Seong Eun Suicide

825
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:43,699
It's not here.

826
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,540
The Detective Choi I know,

827
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,299
as long as no one took it from him,

828
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:50,979
would've hidden it somewhere.

829
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:51,980
Get lost!

830
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:54,900
Black Sun

831
00:52:56,619 --> 00:52:58,298
Since then,

832
00:52:58,299 --> 00:53:01,699
I did all I possibly could to get into Black Sun.

833
00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:04,580
That's why the guys there can't stand me.

834
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:13,298
Hello?

835
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:16,179
Are you Kim Yong Min the journalist?

836
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,580
There's something I must tell you about Detective Choi Seong Eun.

837
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,940
Where are you?

838
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:25,779
Notice of Danger

839
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,900
What is it you have?

840
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,339
Security Tape

841
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,940
Kim Yong Min.

842
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,860
You accepted a bribe and spread false information.

843
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,060
- That's nonsense! - Come with us.

844
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:12,299
- Come along. - I was framed!

845
00:54:14,299 --> 00:54:17,819
We have clear proof that you took a bribe.

846
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:25,259
Overnight, online news and mainstream media...

847
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,940
turned me into a trashy journalist who'd taken a bribe.

848
00:54:33,259 --> 00:54:35,420
They got me good.

849
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,659
You asked me...

850
00:54:47,259 --> 00:54:49,699
why I filmed myself on the rooftop.

851
00:54:52,179 --> 00:54:53,420
To tell the truth,

852
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:56,580
I was hoping they'd kill me.

853
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:01,380
If a video of them beating me to death...

854
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,619
were to appear online,

855
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:08,500
wouldn't the police be forced to reopen the case?

856
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:11,380
That's what I thought.

857
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:17,060
I want to find the punks who killed Seung Eun...

858
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,460
and make them stand trial.

859
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,739
There's nothing more I can do.

860
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:22,259
Tell us your stories of injustice.

861
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:31,540
Deluxe Taxi Service - Don't die, get revenge. We'll do it for you.

862
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:42,179
I know it's not the right time to say this,

863
00:56:43,339 --> 00:56:46,420
but I don't think we're in the position to help Mr. Kim.

864
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,940
I agree.

865
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:51,339
We're in trouble ourselves.

866
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,979
They'll come after us again if they realize Mr. Kim's alive.

867
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,339
We must get them first.

868
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,219
It's possible the guys we're after...

869
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:01,419
and what Mr. Kim wants to find...

870
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,819
are one and the same.

871
00:57:04,699 --> 00:57:06,779
Why are you so quiet, Mr. Jang?

872
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,540
I think...

873
00:57:12,139 --> 00:57:13,460
everyone's right.

874
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:17,298
Mr. Jang, you can't say we're all right.

875
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:18,618
We lost a taxi...

876
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:21,420
and Mr. Kim almost died.

877
00:57:22,819 --> 00:57:24,659
It wasn't the first time, though.

878
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,899
Go Eun's right!

879
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,739
Mr. Kim almost died this time. It was close.

880
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,619
All the answers we want...

881
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,699
are hidden inside the club called Black Sun.

00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:53,699
Yes, I know we're in trouble,

886
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,779
but that person who needs help.

887
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,060
Don't you think he's the reason we exist?

888
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:02,219
I say yes.

889
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:04,699
Me too.

890
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,659
Mr. Kim's already so busy.

891
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,580
You have another job...

892
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,699

00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,860
thank you for choosing our Rainbow Deluxe Taxi.

901
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,379
For your safety and convenience,

902
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,860
I'll explain a few rules.

903
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,019
While the deal is in place,

904
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,060
the cab's meter will keep on running.

905
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,698
The fees will be dealt with...

906
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:46,258
once the whole deal is done.

907
00:59:46,259 --> 00:59:49,139
There may be some extra charges depending on the deal,

908
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:50,899
and once you use our service,

909
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,419
you must not...

910
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,540
breach our work to anyone.

911
00:59:57,179 --> 00:59:58,339
Thank you for complying with the rules.

912
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:02,020
Now, if you'd like to get revenge on those who made you suffer,

913
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,500
press the blue button on the left.

914
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,259

915
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,860

01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:19,459
Yong Min. I won't do this for the drink.

918
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,980
I'll go because you say the place could be dirty.

919
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,299
Yong Min.

920
01:00:26,139 --> 01:00:27,299
You were right.

921
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:30,138
You're the only one I can trust right now.

922
01:00:30,139 --> 01:00:31,580
Let me check one more thing.

923
01:00:41,779 --> 01:00:45,060
Black Sun

924
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:47,580
You made your choice.

925
01:00:48,259 --> 01:00:52,060
Shall we take the deluxe taxi and get your revenge?

926
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:06,460
Deluxe

927
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,339
The Small Bookstore in My Hand

928
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,819
M5283

929
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,460
Deluxe

930
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,819
M5283

931
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:49,819
5283 beginning service.

932
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,580
Taxi Driver 2

933
01:03:31,819 --> 01:03:36,059
That person who needs help is the reason we exist.

934
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,619
Korean Crime Victims Support Association

935
01:03:39,739 --> 01:03:42,659
How could they do this in the center of Seoul?

936
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:45,060
It looks like a playground of evil.

937
01:03:45,339 --> 01:03:47,258
Who do you think you are?

938
01:03:47,259 --> 01:03:48,540
Is it that hard?

939
01:03:48,739 --> 01:03:50,979
It's time to pick a doll.

940
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,580
You should score a home run today.

941
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,499
I'll show you...

942
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,459
what a real hierarchy looks like.

943
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,139
Close the doors. Shut it down.

944
01:03:58,339 --> 01:04:01,020
Don't worry, ma'am. Trust me.

945
01:04:01,259 --> 01:04:02,579
I stopped them for now,

946
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:03,940
but they'll get back up soon.

947
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,060
What are you?

948
01:04:05,219 --> 01:04:07,219
Mr. Kim. Say something!

949
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,420
Goodbye.

950
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:11,939
Mr. Kim. Get a grip.

951
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:14,698
You need to wake up. Sober up!

952
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:15,779
Mr. Kim!
