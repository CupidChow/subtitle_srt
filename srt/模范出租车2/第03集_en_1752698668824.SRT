00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:08,899
Lee Je Hoon

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,540
Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin

3
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:12,019
Jang Hyeok Jin, Bae Yu Ram, Shin Jae Ha

00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,020
Taxi Driver 2

5
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,458
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:33,658
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,900
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,139
We need the teams to gather in one place.

9
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,739
We don't even know...

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,178
how far the teams are spread out, but you want them to gather?

11
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,940
- And on their own accord? - Faster, guys.

12
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,139
Get out of the car already.

13
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:50,218
- Have you gone mad? - Hey.

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,299
Are you crazy?

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,539
Someone might have come up with this ruse...

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,060
to come here.

17
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:57,779
Wang Tao Zi.

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,259
Today, I will rip you to pieces.

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,339
That chairman...

20
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,338
- is a cop. - You see,

21
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:19,819
catching criminals in Korea is pointless.

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,258
Because those criminals have it better in the end.

23
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:26,619
Besides, we take orders from the head office.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,979
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

25
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,259
- Welcome back. - You're back.

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,539
All right. Then is everyone here?

27
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:41,819
Then let's get started again.

28
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:59,539
Hello. I'm On Ha Jun. This is my first day here.

29
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,580
Is anyone here?

30
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,539
Anyone?

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,019
Episode 3

32
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,219
Yes. I finished providing backup...

33
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,418
for the joint security dispatch operation at 3pm.

34
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,819
I'm returning to the headquarters now.

35
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,500
I'll report to you regarding changes in our operation plans.

36
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:13,979
For unity.

37
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,780
Sir, did I tell you the destination?

38
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,339
If you're returning after an operation in the special forces,

39
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,340
isn't this the way?

40
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,739
We'll arrive before you get pulled into night duty.

41
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,019
Lieutenant Kim.

42
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,660
How long has it been?

43
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:32,299
Gathering from your phone call, it sounds like you're a leader now.

44
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,189
- Congratulations. - Wait.

45
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,940
I have manners. I can't sit in the back.

46
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,298
Let me sit in the passenger seat.

47
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:40,419
Sir, you shouldn't move when I'm driving.

48
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,940
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:49,779
All of us were destroyed, so we thought...

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,258
we would lose the last training in the second half of the year.

51
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,419
But you turned the table around all by yourself.

52
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,180
It's still a legend in our unit.

53
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,138
The strongest and the most victorious special forces

54
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,419
We didn't arrive too late.

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,940
Gosh. Already?

56
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,019
The strongest and the most victorious special forces

57
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,500
The strongest and the most victorious special forces

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
Lieutenant Kim.

59
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,500
Have you considered coming back?

60
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,940
Everyone would be thrilled if you were to return.

61
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,019
I don't plan on coming back.

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,099
Then are you planning to join the special security office...

63
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,500
or become a private security guard?

64
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:40,139
- No. - Then what's your plan?

65
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,259
I'm driving this taxi.

66
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,500
You'll be late. You should go inside.

67
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:51,579
Yes, sir. It was an honour to see you again, sir.

68
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,859
For unity.

69
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,500
- Hold on. - Yes.

70
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,419
You still have to pay for the ride.

71
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,100
Sorry.

72
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,299
Here's the card.

73
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:08,660
There are no free taxis.

74
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,220
Payment complete, credit card, total amount: 35 dollars

75
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,060
Be safe. And send my regards to the unit.

76
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,379
Will do. Please give me a call.

77
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,619
707th Special Mission Group

78
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,460
Mom!

79
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:35,660
Taxi Driver 2

80
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:45,580
Thank you.

81
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,140
Bye.

82
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,020
Vacant

83
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,419
If we blow the whistle, you'll really give us ice cream?

84
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,259
If I lie on the ground and don't answer you,

85
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,220
it means I'm very tired.

86
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,499
Take this and share it with your friend.

87
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,379
- Okay? - Yes.

88
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:24,100
Hold on.

89
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:27,299
Can you blow the whistle once I give you the signal?

90
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:41,619
It's okay. This is nothing. Seriously.

91
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,859
I'll be fine.

92
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,820
Not yet.

93
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Not yet.

94
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,379
I'm not ready yet.

95
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:59,020
That guy must be a coward.

96
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,220
Mister, are you actually going to do it?

97
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:03,859
Well...

98
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,059
- Should we do it now? - Now?

99
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,539
- Hey, this is good. - Right?

100
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,419
Mr. Jang

101
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Yes, Mr. Jang.

102
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:00,378
The casing of the bullet that was lodged into Captain Kim's chest...

103
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,820
was actually from Korea.

104
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,699
If it came from Korea,

105
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,220
someone else was also at the scene.

106
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,379
Right. So I'm on my way to find out more about that.

107
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,900
Are you going alone?

108
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,020
Why don't we go together?

109
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,499
Okay. I'll be there soon.

110
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,059
Thank you.

111
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,299
International Departures

112
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,460
Deluxe

113
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,700
What do you think? Doesn't it look amazing?

114
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,700
Well, it's not bad.

115
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,900
Not bad? Jin Eon and I gave our all to this taxi.

116
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,259
It came out perfectly.

117
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,059
My resignation was processed.

118
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,899
It's over. Register me as an employee here.

119
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,499
You should have come sooner. I already did the big reveal.

120
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:49,340
I'll set your salary the same as before.

121
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,460
Hey, why did you bring these?

122
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,138
Why do you think?

123
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,659
So we can use them.

124
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,339
It looks like a microphone.

125
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,979
It's not a simple microphone.

126
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,139
It's a shotgun microphone. They are used for the Olympics.

127
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:02,819
As long as the direction is good,

128
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,259
you can hear someone breathing from 100 meters away.

129
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
Watch.

130
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,659
We can install this on the taxi.

131
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,310
If we install a direction device next to the wheel,

132
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,549
we'll get super hearing.

133
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,060
Gosh. That looks so cool...

134
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,460
and so lame at the same time.

135
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,379
What if it rains?

136
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,339
Maybe, we can install an umbrella. The one that opens and closes.

137
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,778
Gosh. I'm the fool for actually listening to him.

138
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,939
You can't get this at regular stores.

139
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,309
You know what I heard?

140
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,189
Geniuses are really stupid.

141
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,550
How can geniuses be stupid?

142
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,819
Did you make that? You're a genius.

143
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,019
But you'll install it there? You stupid!

144
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,379
Do you think it won't be useful?

145
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,940
We can install that on the side-view mirror.

146
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,699
If we install it inside the side-view mirrors,

147
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,019
it won't get wet from the rain.

148
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,060
If we sync it with the directional control button,

149
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,258
we won't need to install another button for that.

150
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:59,899
I think it will be quite useful when I'm on the street.

151
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,460
Based on the weather, the range may vary.

152
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,139
I'll have to get close if I have to.

153
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:07,940
Please install it. It will be amazing.

154
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:13,619
What a genius.

155
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,499
Gyeong Gu.

156
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,979
Why is Mr. Kim so sweet?

157
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,259
- You think he's sweet? - Yes.

158
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,978
Sweetness is coming out of me now.

159
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,429
You think he's sweet...

160
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,858
because he shoved you into the water and tried to drown you.

161
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,899
When an awful person makes the smallest act of kindness,

162
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,580
it makes him look like the sweetest guy in the world.

163
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,379
Sweetie, install them on the side-view mirrors.

164
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:40,100
Jin Eon, come to your senses.

165
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,820
He can't be sweet. It's Mr. Kim we're talking about.

166
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,550
Always beware of Kim Do Gi.

167
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:50,858
Cotaya, Vietnam

168
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,898
Thank you.

169
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,499
Danger

170
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,659
Jang Seong Cheol, National Police Agency

171
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,019
- Hey. - Hi, Detective Jang.

172
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,539
- Long time no see. Yes. - Long time no see.

173
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,658
So, how is the investigation going?

174
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:06,820
I looked into it.

175
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:10,060
But there's something unusual.

176
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,379
Okay.

177
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,139
Danger

178
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,180
It wasn't a missed shot.

179
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,139
It was a direct aim.

180
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:17,499
He was targeted from the start?

181
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,138
The one and only bullet pierced his heart.

182
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,540
That means they shot to kill.

183
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:26,099
Won't the local police take on the case?

184
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,539
No. The local police...

185
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,899
seem to want to wrap it up as is.

186
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,059
Our police force thinks the same.

187
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,019
Since all the victims including Dong Jae returned safely,

188
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,019
I guess that could be good enough.

189
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,859
Is something bothering you?

190
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,580
If...

191
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,179
there's someone out there...

192
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,340
capable of hiring a sniper...

193
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,859
to take out the police captain,

194
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,019
that's a serious problem.

195
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,619
It means you were exposed to them.

196
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,659
So what?

197
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,540
It's not like we'll sit and do nothing.

198
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:11,300
What will you do? Hit me?

199
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,460
Why would I...

200
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,459
Why would I hit you, Mr. On?

201
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,658
You just came in.

202
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:20,739
So I should take the log.

203
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,779
I'll bring it to you later, Go Eun.

204
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,739
- When? - In ten minutes?

205
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,700
In five minutes.

206
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,180
I'm getting a frustrated feeling.

207
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,580
He's somewhat like Mr. Park.

208
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:40,580
Hey, Mr. On.

209
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,979
Hello, it's a lovely morning.

210
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,339
Why are you harassing him already, Go Eun?

211
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm not harassing him.

212
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,220
Bring it to me in five.

213
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:54,060
- Would you like a coffee? - No, thanks.

214
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,499
- Do you want some coins? - I have some.

215
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:58,300
Maybe next time.

216
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:00,778
Okay. Enjoy your coffee.

217
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,859
Okay.

218
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,779
He's handsome, like me.

219
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:06,259
- Like who? - Like me.

220
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,859
- Mr. On's good-looking. - Yes, like me.

221
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,540
- He's handsome. - Like me.

222
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,420
- Mr. On's nice-looking. - Okay.

223
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:19,379
Do Gi. Could you help me out?

224
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:20,580
Come here.

225
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,300
I drove really cautiously,

226
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,420
but a car suddenly appeared...

227
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:30,300
What should I do?

228
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,420
It's not bad enough to need a paint job.

229
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:37,540
You can get a pen at a car accessory store.

230
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,460
Cover it up with that.

231
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,019
Is that really all I have to do?

232
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:43,820
Yes.

233
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:47,940
Thank you, sir.

234
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,219
What did I do?

235
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,059
I was so scared, you know.

236
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,300
I'll go get that pen right away. Thanks.

237
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,778
Oh, the taxi log.

238
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,700
Seoul

239
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:03,700

248
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,460
Out of the Office

249
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,940
This client is elderly.

250
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,499
The first thing she said was unlike what other clients said.

251
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:05,899
It was different?

252
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,270
If I die,

253
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,820
nothing bad will happen to my kids, right?

254
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,698
If you tell me in detail what happened,

255
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,510
I'll answer all your questions.

256
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,659
I don't have much to say about myself.

257
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,780
It's all my fault.

258
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,938
Where are you?

259
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:33,990
I'll send a car over.

260
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,990

266
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,750
Now, will you tell me all about...

267
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:24,060
what happened?

268
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,619
It's all...

269
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,619
my fault.

270
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,459
Moms and Dads!

271
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,100
I opened a business in the town square!

272
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,699
Come and hang out!

273
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:57,658
I'm here to live!

274
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,419
Come on over!

275
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:04,459
What's all this noise?

276
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:09,510
With those slow steps

277
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,938
It'll take you too long to come to me

278
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:17,060
Like the birds flying in the sky

279
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:22,270
When I first saw him, I noticed he was such a good singer.

280
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,339
You keep looking around

281
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,509
It'll take you too long to come to me

282
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,819
Come back to me before it's too late

283
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,859
Hurry back

284
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:48,858
My love is drifting away

286
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,540
My dear, you are so beautiful

287
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,059
Doesn't this feel good?

288
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,218
Oh, yes, I'm coming to you

289
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,698
- Ma'am! - Yes?

290
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:07,579
- Your kids want you to be healthy. - That's right.

291
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,659
It feels so good.

292
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,059
Festival for the Elderly

293
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,509
Oh, my gosh.

294
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:20,379
Don't take the stairs, take the elevator

295
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:23,938
This is for you, Mama.

296
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:26,418
- The Mama with the rose. - Have a drink.

297
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,019
- Drink up. - Let's drink.

298
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,579
- Cheers. - Isn't this nice?

299
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,379
You showed us a good time...

300
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,458
and you even let us eat.

301
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,459
Not at all.

302
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,299
Don't you need us to buy one of those?

303
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,378
Mama, don't you worry about that.

304
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:45,698
Only people who really need one should get one.

305
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:48,418
If you buy stuff you don't need,

306
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:49,510
I'll get upset.

307
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,510
If you get what I meant, show your little finger and promise.

308
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:00,019
Promise. Pinky swear.

309
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,659
Watching him perform...

310
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:05,618
was so much fun and time flew by.

311
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:07,379
Do you promise?

312
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,699
Oh, Mama.

313
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:17,418
Don't you feel sorry for Gyu Nam's mom?

314
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:19,898
Her son's company isn't doing well...

315
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:22,219
and he isn't getting paid on time.

316
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:25,060
He hasn't been home in over a year.

317
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:29,270
One of her grandchildren constantly needs a doctor,

318
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:30,990
so the father hasn't been able to visit.

319
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,340
But he's a sweetheart.

320
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,899
- Poor thing. - Tell me about it.

321
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,698
- We should drink. - Sure.

322
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,619
- Enjoy, then. - Right.

323
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:42,540
Let's drink.

324
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,218
Allow me to help.

325
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,698
- You'll ruin your clothes. - Let me.

326
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:53,750
It's the least I can do for the delicious food you got us.

327
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,540
Mama, I'm only saying this because you're striking.

328
00:21:58,379 --> 00:21:59,980
How about a selfie together?

329
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,698
- That's preposterous. - Come over here.

330
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,658
- Come on. - What?

331
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:06,540
- No, don't. - Come on.

332
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,780
- Goodness. - Here we go. In 1, 2, 3.

333
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:11,618
Mama, give me a smile.

334
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:13,419
In 1, 2, 3.

335
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,179
For the ladies and gentlemen here at the event,

336
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,780
we have prepared a raffle!

337
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,378
Festival for the Elderly

338
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:27,419
- This is what the winner will win. - The winner.

339
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,580
- The far infrared gamma lamp. - The lamp!

340
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:34,980
All right, then.

341
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:37,378
What do your grandchildren say when they visit?

342
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:40,379
I bet they don't come close to you complaining that you smell.

343
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,739
Your grandchildren will love this lamp even more.

344
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,299
It eliminates odour...

345
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,139
and kills harmful bugs.

346
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,859
Then, let's see.

347
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:54,820
Let's see who wins the lamp.

348
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,378
- Who will win the prize? - Number three.

349
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,219
- What's the number? - Number eight.

350
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:03,418
Number 27.

351
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,458
- Number 27. - Number 27!

352
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:07,138
- Number 27. - Number 27.

353
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:08,579
Number 27, where are you?

354
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,458
- Number 27? - Who has the number 27 ticket?

355
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:12,819
Look. You have the number 27 ticket.

356
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,539
Over here. She has the number 27 ticket.

357
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,378
- Get out there already. - Come on out.

358
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,739
- Come on. - You won the top prize

359
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,340
- You won the top prize - You won the top prize

360
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:26,339
That's how it is to win the top prize

361
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,740
- Give it up for her. - Applaud!

362
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:31,299
Please fill this in first.

363
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,019
We'll be paying for the lamp itself.

364
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,259
All you have to do is pay the 22 percent...

365
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,459
taxes and the public utilities charge.

366
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,260
I don't have any money.

367
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,619
You should give this to someone else who needs it.

368
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,100
Mama, not everyone wins the top prize.

369
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,658
I'll pay the taxes and the public utilities charge,

370
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:49,938
so take the lamp with you.

371
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:51,259
Just give her the lamp.

372
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,938
- Please take it. - Don't do that.

373
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:55,458
I don't need it.

374
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:58,138
Gosh. What is with you?

375
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,898
- Goodness. - Mama.

376
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,100
Give it to me instead.

377
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,739
Scallops, Kelp, Sea squirt

378
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,379
Since that day, I avoided the festival on purpose.

379
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,740
- Mama! - Goodness me.

380
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,099
What brings you by?

381
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,139
Mama, why haven't you come to watch my performance?

382
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,300
Because I'm sorry.

383
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:24,899
I'm not able to buy anything that you're offering.

384
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,858
If you won't come by to hear me sing,

385
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:30,179
I'll perform right here.

386
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
No, don't.

387
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:35,458
My love for seaweed

388
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:37,259
It's unconditional

389
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,019
I never did anything for him.

390
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,539
- My love for seaweed - So I was grateful.

391
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,979
- He's so good. - It is my ultimate love

392
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,540
How about some tasty seaweed soup for dinner today?

393
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:51,099
Across the Pacific

394
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,819
Across the Atlantic

395
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,859
Even across the Indian Ocean

396
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,499
I will run to wherever seaweed calls for me

397
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,418
I will run to it no matter what

398
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,459
He's such a good singer.

399
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,740
You must have some good news.

400
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:14,899
Do you want to see it?

401
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,540
It's my son. He turned five this year.

402
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,980
My grandchild turned five this year as well.

403
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,020
He's a pretty one just like his dad.

404
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,100
My son's sick, you see.

405
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:31,859
I can't see him often since he's at a hospital.

406
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,499
I'm going to earn a lot of money...

407
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,659
and buy him loads of toys for when I visit.

408
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,899
Goodness.

409
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,580
I should eat up and perform my best.

410
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,580
I'll enjoy, Mama.

411
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:51,060
It's so good.

412
00:25:56,899 --> 00:25:59,820
Thanks, Mama. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal.

413
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:02,139
Come to see my show, okay?

414
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,699
No, don't walk me out. Get back inside.

415
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,939
Him working hard to care for his sick son...

416
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:13,260
reminded me of my Gyu Nam.

417
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,019
- Of course. - How can you sing that well?

418
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,300
- Gosh. - You drive me crazy.

419
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,059
That's just how it is. I should pay you now.

420
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,740
- Right. - Here you go.

421
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:41,340
Mama, what brings you by?

422
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:45,219
I came to buy something, of course.

423
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,698
But you've been saving up...

424
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:50,259
not even going to a doctor when you're sick.

425
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,379
Gosh, no. I'm perfectly healthy.

426
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,300
I understand how you feel.

427
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
So this money?

428
00:26:58,459 --> 00:26:59,500
You keep it.

429
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
When you run out of money,

430
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:02,340
you'll have to ask your children for more...

431
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,179
which will only make you feel guilty.

432
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,060
Gosh. You're such a sweetheart.

433
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,659
Rather than something that involves money,

434
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:15,300
can I ask a different kind of favour?

435
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:21,060
Credit Card Application Form

436
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,820
You applying for this credit card...

437
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,939
will get me tens of dollars as commission.

438
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,858
Once you receive it, just cut it in half if you like.

439
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:34,939
Sure.

440
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:38,580
Am I asking for too much?

441
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,418
Let's not do this, then.

442
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:42,699
- Maybe next time. - It's fine.

443
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:44,259
I'll sign it.

444
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,459
Applicant name

445
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:49,580
Lee Im Soon

446
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,060
There you go.

447
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,378
- Gosh. Thank you. - Thank you.

448
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:01,379
Right. Have a good day.

449
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,019
You did something for me, so I should repay you.

450
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,138
Don't be ridiculous. I'm fine.

451
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:14,060
Remember the top prize you won at the festival?

452
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:16,419
I paid the 22 percent taxes and the public utilities charge.

453
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,898
I'll have it delivered to your home tomorrow.

454
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:21,539
Don't do that. I doubt it was cheap.

455
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,219
But I already paid for it.

456
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,179
Since that's how it is, you should use it at home.

457
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:36,659
One shouldn't easily sign any kind of document.

458
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:37,899
Tell me about it.

459
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,178
The five-year-old son that's in the hospital?

460
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,300
It's a lie.

461
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,539
He made up a story about a non-existing son...

462
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,899
and lied to Ms. Lee.

463
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:48,378
After hearing from her neighbours about her son who lives far away...

464
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:50,740
and the grandchild who's sick,

465
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,060
he came up with a similar story.

466
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,020
To get her to see him as she would see her son.

467
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:57,539
Ms. Lee...

468
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,938
has been feeling sorry for her son...

469
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,500
who is working hard in a city far away.

470
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:03,939
It's why she couldn't ignore him...

471
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,658
when he said he was making money to buy toys for his son.

472
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:09,540
Back in the day, my grandma...

473
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,980
didn't easily spend the money she had hidden in her closet.

474
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,419
The fact that she offered it to him...

475
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,459
means she thought of him as one of her own.

476
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,980
While unaware of the scumbag he is.

477
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,540
Festival for the Elderly

478
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,779
Far-infrared Radiation Gamma Lamp

479
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,138
Far-infrared Radiation Gamma Lamp

480
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,659
Raffle

481
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,418
Back scratcher

482
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:40,259
Goodness, Mama. Are you off to sell seaweed?

483
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,259
Yes, I thought I'd set up shop while the weather is nice.

484
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,819
Maybe I should help you like last time.

485
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,980
No, don't. I don't want to burden you.

486
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:52,019
By the way, can you watch the stall for me?

487
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,658
I was hoping to grab a bite to eat.

488
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,699
Sure thing. Don't worry and enjoy your fill.

489
00:29:57,139 --> 00:29:59,500
The price is written next to the products.

490
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,739
You can hand them out for free if you want though.

491
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,499
Gosh, why would I offer them for free?

492
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,139
One should accept payment when it's necessary.

493
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:08,780
Go and enjoy your meal, then.

494
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:10,539
Let me set this aside for you.

495
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,780
There you go.

496
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,740
- I won't be gone long. - Sure.

497
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:18,938
- Hold on. - What are you doing here?

498
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:20,299
Gyu Nam's mom, isn't that you?

499
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,739
- Gyu Nam's mom? - What are you doing here?

500
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
- How nice. - Are you giving these out for free?

501
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:28,300
They're not for free, but they are being sold.

502
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:31,618
Why don't you buy one each? They are of good quality.

503
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:33,299
I should see what you have.

504
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,260
- It's a lamp. - That's right.

505
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,979
- Is it effective? - Is this the price?

506
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,540
Yes, that's the price.

507
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:42,740
Mama, wait.

508
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,218
Let me buy all of this.

509
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:48,699
Someone wanted the seaweed.

510
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:50,939
- This many? - Here.

511
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,618
No, it's too much.

512
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,019
I sold them at a high price, that's all.

513
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Now, take this.

514
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,658
- But it's too much. - Here you go.

515
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,139
- I can't. - There.

516
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:02,459
When your son and grandchild visit,

517
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,579
don't let them give you money.

518
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,659
Give them money instead.

519
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,378
They'd be surprised.

520
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:10,179
It might shock them.

521
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,540
Is the vendor here?

522
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,219
No, I'll keep watching the stall.

523
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,339
Go and wash your hands. Take out the trash as well.

524
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,820
- Got it. Thanks, Mama. - Sure.

525
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:24,139
Hello, there.

526
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,059
Are you the one selling these?

527
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,658
That's right. Which one would you like?

528
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:32,339
- I'll see what you have first. - Sure.

529
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,379
- Check the price tags too. - Sure thing.

530
00:31:41,939 --> 00:31:43,060
Mama!

531
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:45,179
Gosh. Mama.

532
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,618
Can we keep these at your place?

533
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:49,339
Those nice lamps shouldn't get wet.

534
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,820
- Bring them here. - Go on.

535
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:52,899
Gosh.

536
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,139
- Goodness. - My gosh.

537
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:58,260
It's pouring down at the outdoor stage.

538
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,618
We had nowhere to store them. Can we keep them here for now?

539
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,019
Of course. That'll be fine.

540
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,659
- Hey. You should go now. - Okay.

541
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,418
Mama, thank you.

542
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:07,458
Gosh. You don't have to thank me.

543
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,020
I'll go and bring the rest of the stuff. Wait up for me! Gosh.

544
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,219
Yes. Right here.

545
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,259
Here's the deal.

546
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,379
Either give us new ones. Or give us a refund.

547
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,378
What are you talking about?

548
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:34,059
Why would I give you a refund?

549
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,299
I heard you were at the tent.

550
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,019
That was because he asked me to watch the tent.

551
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,099
You told me I should buy one. You said the quality was good.

552
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,020
My goodness. What on earth happened?

553
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,658
Festival for the Elderly

554
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:50,698
Festival for the Elderly

555
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,138
- Look at this. - What is this?

556
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,539
- How could this happen? - No one is here.

557
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,619
Gosh.

558
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,179
- Goodness. - The police are here. Over here.

559
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,698
This lady sold me this.

560
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:05,739
Right.

561
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,938
Are you Ms. Lee Im Soon?

562
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:10,019
How could you sell us defective products?

563
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,499
- Come with us to the station. - This thing doesn't even work.

564
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,980
How could you sell this to us? How will you fix this?

565
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,659
Name: Lee Im Soon

566
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,218
What do you mean I bought the goods?

567
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:21,739
You made a credit card under your name.

568
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,059
You used the card to pay for the goods and received them.

569
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,060
I did?

570
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:27,779
Right here. The card statement says you bought everything.

571
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,299
How many times must I show this to you?

572
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,500
No.

573
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,938
I was just helping him.

574
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:36,059
Gosh. Everyone saw you receiving money from him.

575
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,980
If you were just helping him, why did you accept the money?

576
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,580
He told me to give the money to my son. That's why.

577
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,659
- Gosh. - You must be mistaken.

578
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,339
You're not here as a victim.

579
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,819
You were in on it with them!

580
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,299
Aunt, let me talk to them.

581
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,178
The quality of these products is pretty bad.

582
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:58,540
It burned my aunt's back.

583
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:02,339
How can you sell something that doesn't even work?

584
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,458
No. I...

585
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,218
All right. Calm down. Sit down.

586
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:06,779
Sit down, ma'am.

587
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,020
Calm down.

588
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,419
Call your son to come.

589
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,429
What? I can't call my son.

590
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,909
Then is there anyone young you can ask for help?

591
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,298
It's just my son, his wife, and his child. That's everyone.

592
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:23,908
Then call your son.

593
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,299
Don't you want to fix this problem?

594
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,179
I can't let my son know.

595
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,940
Sir.

596
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:32,460
Please don't call my son.

597
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:36,500
He lives far from here. And he's working really hard.

598
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,219
Please.

599
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,060
Please just punish me.

600
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:44,659
Just...

601
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,179
- Gosh. I can't get through to her. - Please, sir.

602
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:18,219
Sang Gi

603
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:23,299
Mama, it's me.

604
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:25,659
Don't call me that.

605
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Gosh. Don't be like that, Mama.

606
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:35,659
Everyone in the village came to my house.

607
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,020
I went to the police station.

608
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,389
They told me to bring my son here.

609
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,819
Obviously.

610
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,869
If you can't fix it, your son will have to.

611
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:51,540
I can't even help my son.

612
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,500
I can't be a burden on my son.

613
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:01,259
But they will still call your son.

614
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:07,338
Which is why I'm calling you now.

615
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:08,619
So I can give you a tip.

616
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,940
You can take it as your burden and die in debt.

617
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:20,500
Then your son won't be responsible.

618
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,020
Think about it carefully.

619
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:32,540
I hung up.

620
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:35,179
- Cheers. - Cheers.

621
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:46,909
I'd rather die...

622
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:51,909
than leave this burden on my son. I can't let that happen.

623
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:57,179
She should report this to the police,

624
00:36:57,819 --> 00:36:59,779
but she ended up getting reported.

625
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:02,339
Shouldn't she still report this?

626
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,059
Even if she does, he won't be punished properly.

627
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Why not?

628
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:10,179
Everything he sold was basically rubbish.

629
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,059
Even if he sells it for 1 dollar after buying it for 10 cents,

630
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,908
it's not considered illegal.

631
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:18,428
It's only a matter of conscience.

632
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:20,778
He has an extensive playbook for his schemes too.

633
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:24,580
He's done all sorts of schemes to scam the elderly.

634
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:26,738
The elderly are already struggling as it is.

635
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:28,218
These guys were determined to extort every penny out of them.

636
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:29,219
Those jerks.

637
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:35,060
Why are they going after people who are already struggling?

638
00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:38,179
Because that's not their focus.

639
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:44,980
To them, the elderly are easy targets to deceive.

640
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,979
But if she doesn't explain herself, the victims won't know the truth.

641
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,459
"I didn't buy these products."

642
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,339
"I'm a victim too. I was scammed too."

643
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,389
Why didn't she defend herself more?

644
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:55,779
These guys had a clear goal from the get-go.

645
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,339
Whatever scheme they pulled,

646
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,540
they needed someone who would have to keep it from the family...

647
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,540
and who would...

648
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,540
take the fall for everything. That was the target they looked for.

649
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:09,739
Looking like that.

650
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,259
Yoo Sang Gi

651
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:15,579
You can take it as your burden and die in debt.

652
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,659
Then your son won't be responsible.

653
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:19,940
Just like any parent, Ms. Lee feared...

654
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:24,500
more about inconveniencing her son than getting punished.

655
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:27,298
That's why even to the last moment,

656
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:30,339
she kept asking me questions about her son and sounded worried.

657
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,500
She reminds me of my grandma.

658
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:34,580
They are the worst.

659
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,060
What should we do with those jerks?

660
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,580
We should give them...

661
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:41,659
a taste of their own medicine.

662
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,819
Right?

00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:33,819
thank you for choosing our Rainbow Deluxe Taxi.

671

For your safety and convenience,

672
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,778
I'll explain a few rules.

673
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:40,388
While the deal is in place,

674
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:43,389
the cab's meter will keep on running.

675
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,500
The fees will be dealt with once the whole deal is done.

676
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,500
There may be some extra charges depending on the deal,

677
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:54,818
and once you use our service,

678
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,940
you must not breach our work to anyone.

679
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,179
Thank you for complying with the rules.

680
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:04,100
Now, if you'd like to get revenge on those who made you suffer,

681
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,659
press the blue button on the left.

682
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:08,179
If you don't want to get revenge,

683
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:11,869
press the red button on the right.

684
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,868
Please make your choice.

685
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,909
Select

686
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:19,909
Mama. In 1, 2, 3.

687
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,428
Once you receive it, just cut it in half if you like.

688
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:24,779
You made a credit card under your name.

689
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:27,339
You used the card to pay for the goods and received them.

690
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,779
Hello.

691
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:42,579
Are you Ms. Lee Im Soon?

692
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,339
You're behind on your credit card payment.

693
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,698
But I don't have any money.

694
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:51,428
Then we're forced to file a lawsuit and take this to court.

695
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:52,460
Lawsuit?

696
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:54,540
If I get sued,

697
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:57,868
will my son find out too?

698
00:40:57,869 --> 00:40:59,389
Yes, that's right.

699
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,019
If you don't pay,

700
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,259
we must have your son pay for it.

701
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,259
I'm sorry.

702
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,739
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

703
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,100
It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself.

704
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:21,020
It's not your fault.

705
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,139
Don't blame yourself.

706
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:26,338

00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:34,179
Far-infrared Radiation Gamma Lamp

724
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,500
Gosh, it's heavy.

725
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,580
Here.

726
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:47,579
We buy from stores that are closing

727
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,859
You idiot.

728
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,020
This is a mess. Hand over the tape.

729
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:57,859
They buy from stores that are closing down...

730
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,420
and they only deal in cash,

731
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:01,299
so I had a hard time finding them.

732
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,339
"Far-infrared radiation gamma lamp?"

733
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,339
Do you think it really helps catch bugs you can't even see?

734
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:22,619
Yes. Gamma rays are radiation.

735
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,059
It kills bugs you can't see, birds,

736
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,859
dogs, and humans. Basically everything.

737
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,980
It's mad dangerous.

738
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,020
They're all fake.

739
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,419
The sanitizing lamp they sold...

740
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,579
was a normal lamp covered in cellophane.

741
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,739
It was crude too.

742
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,619
They think they can do anything to scam the elderly.

743
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:39,819
My gosh.

744
00:44:40,259 --> 00:44:42,020
How could they think of selling that?

745
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:45,540
- Sir. Hey. - Yes?

746
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,699
Let's see.

747
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:50,738
Thank you for another good day.

748
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:52,579
- Here's your 100 dollars. - Thank you.

749
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,540
- Thanks. - Bye.

750
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:56,139
- Take care. - You too.

751
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,420
Far-infrared Radiation Gamma Lamp

752
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:00,339
Do you have everything?

753
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,619
Deluxe

754
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,020
We buy from stores that are closing

755
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,500
It'll be sunny tomorrow.

756
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,420
Moms and Dads!

757
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,739
I'm here because I missed you!

758
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,860
I'm here to live!

759
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:43,460
Come on over!

760
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:56,779
With those slow steps

761
00:45:57,219 --> 00:46:01,219
It'll take you too long to come to me

762
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:05,179
Like the birds flying in the sky

763
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,980
Spread your wings and fly to me

764
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:15,219
You keep looking around

765
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,699
Isn't he a good singer?

766
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,459
You're strikingly beautiful.

767
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,778
Why are your shoulders so stiff?

768
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:22,218
I work so much.

769
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:24,060
You shouldn't overdo it.

770
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:26,860
- Look after yourself from now on. - Okay.

771
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,420
Look at this. One press of the button...

772
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,139
My love

773
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,100
My love is drifting away

774
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:40,460
My dear

775
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:44,778
My dear, I miss you so much

776
00:46:44,779 --> 00:46:45,819
Dr. Lee's General Store

777
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,460
I'm moving in for a shot of just him.

778
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,299
Video quality's great. Very nice.

779
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:03,500
Yongsori Village

780
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,900

781
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:15,100
Say kimchi. One, two.

782
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,580
Get home safe.

783
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:34,299
Can we see what message they got?

784
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,819
Come on, Mr. Kim.

785
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,980
Don't ask if we can. Ask me to pull it up.

786
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,860
It sounds like you're asking if it can't be done.

787
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,019
Yoo Sang Gi's phone

788
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,779
He shared the old man's photo as soon as he took it.

789
00:47:51,219 --> 00:47:53,540
It's obvious what'll happen next.

790
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,658
Do you all have your raffle tickets?

791
00:47:57,659 --> 00:47:58,738
Yes!

792
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:00,778
Let's see who wins third place.

793
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:03,339
Third place.

794
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:06,818
Why are you so excited about a rigged raffle?

795
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:09,338
Don't worry, you won't win.

796
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:12,259
Silence. 70 percent of life is good luck.

797
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:14,619
I'm feeling lucky today.

798
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:16,779
Poor guy.

799
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,659
The number one prize, the best one!

800
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:24,379
That's mine!

801
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,299
- That'll be mine! - Let's see...

802
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,499
I got it!

803
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,940
Who's the lucky winner?

804
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,059
Number 19!

805
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,459
- Number 19! - Where are you?

806
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,499
- Who's Number 19? - Number 19!

807
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,779
- That's me. - You?

808
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,738
Congratulations on winning the best prize!

809
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:46,218
Come on up.

810
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:49,258
You won the best prize

811
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,939
This is what it's like to win the best prize

812
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,259
- Applause! - Give him a warm hand!

813
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,060
Go back to your seat.

814
00:48:58,259 --> 00:49:00,219
Congratulations.

815
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,020
All of you who won a prize today.

816
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:05,698
My staff will come over...

817
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:08,979
and have you sign some papers acknowledging your win.

818
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,779
We need your ID. You must bring your ID, okay?

819
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,580

820
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,259
Prize Receipt

821
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,059
Yong Chil goes on holiday tomorrow.

822
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,900
- Send these and confirm service. - Okay.

823
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:25,940
He goes on holiday? What about us?

824
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,779
Yong Chil? Service?

825
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,818
Service...

826
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:33,219
Yoo Sang Gi's phone

827
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,618
- Go Eun. - Wait.

828
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:38,060
Don't speak. Let me guess what you'll say.

829
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,580
I guess you'll be right.

830
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,699
I haven't answered yet.

831
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:45,860
How do things look for Ms. Lee?

832
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,020
Yoo Sang Gi's phone

833
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,060
There are six phones in Lee Im Soon's name.

834
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,219
Do you think she knows this?

835
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,500
I'd say she doesn't.

836
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,259
They targeted her knowing she couldn't check it out.

837
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,179
I bet they did all they could with those phones.

838
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,138
They maxed out each one...

839
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:13,060
to buy game items on an instalment plan.

840
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:15,779
It adds up to quite a lot.

841
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:18,259
We'll get it all back.

842
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:21,500
But first, I must meet this Yong Chil.

843
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,540
Let me summarize.

844
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:33,060
You got a discount on the Smart 83 plan.

845
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,419
You'll pay it off over 36 months...

846
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,020
at 153 dollars 80 cents a month.

847
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,099
You'll never get this deal anywhere else.

848
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,580
I guarantee you that.

849
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,659
Sign these papers and I'll get the rest done.

850
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,779
- Maybe next time. - What?

851
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:51,020
You made me explain only to run off?

852
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,298
Do you have a death wish?

853
00:50:53,299 --> 00:50:54,339
What?

854
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,178
South Gyeongsang Province, North Jeolla Province

855
00:50:58,179 --> 00:50:59,939
Gangwon Province, Chungcheong Province

856
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,739

862
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:21,179
Yoo Sung Ja's new phone is registered

863
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:23,339
My gosh.

864
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,138
He can explain to a guy all day long...

865
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:28,100
and still make nothing.

866
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,779
Don't you feel bad for him?

867
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,939
Are you done with the old man who collects scrap?

868
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,178
Yes. I went with the most expensive plan...

869
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:38,659
and packed it full of paid services and game items.

870
00:51:39,259 --> 00:51:42,139
Three of the latest models for a total of 9,000 dollars.

871
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:43,860
Okay, nice.

872
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,779
Who's next?

873
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:49,338
It's this old man.

874
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,739
It's from the trot singer wannabe.

875
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,419
He has the face of a man with good credit.

876
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,699
One, two.

877
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:01,020
Let's give him all he can take so he doesn't feel left out.

878
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,980
See if you can bring the total to 12,000 dollars.

879
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:09,738
Boss. I'll do my best.

880
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:10,739
Good.

881
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:16,059
That trot singer guy.

882
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,539
How does he manage this?

883
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,819
Isn't it great how he brings us such great customers?

884
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:24,060
What's his secret?

885
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,540
A customer walked in...

886
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:46,980
and you don't even say hi?

887
00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:50,100
No customer ever came in the back.

888
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:53,420
Hello, welcome.

889
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,900
Take a seat.

890
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,420
I want to cancel a subscription.

891
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:09,420
Cancel? You want to cancel?

892
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:13,860
Lee Im Soon

893
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,739
My gosh.

894
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:20,060
Where did you come from?

895
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,139
I'm a client. Now, cancel the subscriptions.

896
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,659
Lee Duk Gu

897
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,139
Subscriptions can't be cancelled here though.

898
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,619
I'm sure it's doable.

899
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:49,060
You clearly don't get what I'm saying.

900
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,739
Get lost while you can still walk.

901
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:10,900
This place has good service.

902
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:12,900
You even spoke my line for me.

903
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,139
This random punk is getting on my nerves.

904
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:21,219
Darn it!

905
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,060

00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:00,460
Let's see.

907
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,540
Lee Duk Gu

908
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,380
Nari Village, Yeongdo-gun, Chuncheon, Gangwon Province

909
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,420
Subscriptions are cancelled.

910
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:16,460
Not the stairs, but the elevator

911
00:56:16,779 --> 00:56:17,819
There.

912
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,020
Yong Chil, you punk. Are you on vacation or what?

913
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,619
We need to take out phone plans before the old man drops dead.

914
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,060
Hey, let's hit the sauna.

915
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:42,460
I'm reeking of old people.

916
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:24,100
Mr. Kim, what will be our plan?

917
00:57:42,779 --> 00:57:46,339
What are we supposed to do when Mr. Kim makes a move like that?

918
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,658
- Let's gather things. - Gather what?

919
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:51,020
What? I don't know.

920
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:55,099
- We'll gather what we don't know? - Yes, let's gather things.

921
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,138
Gather what?

922
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,500
I said I don't know, you jerk.

923
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,138
- Sorry. - Am I the issue here?

924
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:02,658
Of course, you are.

925
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:04,218
You keep asking me what I don't know.

926
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:06,138
And it seems like you still don't get it.

927
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:07,179
Who on earth would get it?

928
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,779
Out of those supported by Blue Bird who moved residences this quarter,

929
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,618
a total of 17 residences don't have window guards.

930
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:17,818
Winter is said to come early this year,

931
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:20,939
so it'd be nice to set up window guards...

932
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,060
as well as breeze blockers for families living with the elderly.

933
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,619
A few of our supporters withdrew their donations.

934
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,259
So should we go ahead with this project?

935
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,539
The window guards alone will cost us a lot.

936
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,618
We'd love nothing more than for our victims' pain...

937
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:37,979
to be reduced just like our funding.

938
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,178
Anyway, I'll do my best to cover the cost.

939
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:41,900
Blue Bird Foundation Operating Committee Meeting

940
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,818
Blue Bird

941
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:49,698
That'll be all for today's meeting, then.

942
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:51,218
- Thank you for coming. - Thank you.

943
00:58:51,219 --> 00:58:52,619
- Will you now excuse me? - Sure.

944
00:58:56,139 --> 00:58:58,420
My gosh. What happened?

945
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:03,860
I was being safe on the road but...

946
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:08,299
You can pay it from my salary.

947
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:09,739
Are you injured?

948
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:11,699
Sorry?

949
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,980
Did you get yourself checked out?

950
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,138
No.

951
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:17,818
If you get in an accident, get yourself checked out.

952
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:19,460
Do that first. Got it?

953
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:21,860
Come on. I'll drive.

954
00:59:22,819 --> 00:59:25,178
Don't force yourself to adapt.

955
00:59:25,179 --> 00:59:26,540
You're doing fine as is.

956
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,060
Thanks for that.

957
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,739
So tell me. How's the commute?

958
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:33,580
I actually found a new place to move into.

959
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:35,580
Good for you. Get in, then.

960
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:46,219
Jin Eon, to the left.

961
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:48,939
- The far left. - Why didn't you say that sooner?

962
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,940
I now have to move the ladder.

963
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:52,819
- Why are you moving it around? - To the right.

964
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,818
No, the left is better.

965
00:59:54,819 --> 00:59:55,859
- There? - Over there.

966
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:56,940
Couldn't you have led with that?

967
00:59:57,819 --> 01:00:01,059
Stop the ruckus, will you? You're giving me a headache.

968
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,139
Go Eun, the key to sales is in the display.

969
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:06,379
Hang in there even though it gives you a headache.

970
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,259
It's because she hasn't run a business before.

971
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,020
You're having the time of your lives, aren't you?

972
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,500
Over there?

973
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:16,338
- Goodness. - Welcome.

974
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:17,419
Welcome.

975
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,658
Get two baggy pants for the price of one.

976
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:22,618
- We awaited your arrival. - That will be two dollars.

977
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,818
The karaoke machine is 1,000 dollars.

978
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:25,499
- It's not small. - What if we buy two?

979
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,699
That'll be five dollars.

980
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,739
- Goodness. - Meanwhile, this is 1,000 dollars.

981
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,580
Hey.

982
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,099
Fix the air-conditioner, will you?

983
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,979
Must we drive without it in this heat?

984
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,540
It'd be cheaper to scrap the truck.

985
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,540
Why can I only see rice paddies in this village?

986
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:50,420
Are you sure we're going the right way?

987
01:00:51,259 --> 01:00:53,259
That's odd. Did I take a wrong turn?

988
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:56,819
What the...

989
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,380
- Hey. - What just happened?

990
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:04,100
Get out.

991
01:01:04,179 --> 01:01:05,699
Get out of the truck.

992
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,860
What's going on?

993
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,139
Hey!

994
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:15,579
I told you to check on the truck...

995
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:16,818
since we can't afford to break down in the countryside.

996
01:01:16,819 --> 01:01:19,380
It was fine though.

997
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,618
Why you...

998
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:22,619
Sang Gi, should we call our insurance company?

999
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,899
And then what? Are they across the street?

1000
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,900
Who knows when they'll get here?

1001
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:28,500
Did you dodge that? Why you...

1002
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,580
Good harvest

1003
01:02:18,339 --> 01:02:19,980
Is something the matter?

1004
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,900
Taxi Driver 2

1005
01:03:12,339 --> 01:03:13,420
Let us begin.

1006
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:15,899
The priority dispatch service has been requested.

1007
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,658
Did someone call the Priority Dispatch Service?

1008
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:19,499
Let the insurance company handle it!

1009
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,579
Why is that?

1010
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,619
How about a walk?

1011
01:03:22,259 --> 01:03:23,819
A whale was right in front of us.

1012
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,060
I'm sure that he hid it in a field somewhere.

1013
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,619
Starting tomorrow, we'll all tail him.

1014
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,338
- Help me, will you? - What now?

1015
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:33,860
You're the only one we can count on now.

1016
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,619
I'm Eun Yi.

1017
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:38,339
They chose to hurt the most innocent people.

1018
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,819
It's about time they get a taste of their own twisted medicine.

1019
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,739
Call Mr. Jang...

1020
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,860
and tell him to go on one last walk.
