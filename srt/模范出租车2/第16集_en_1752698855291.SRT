All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,019
The correctional institution and religion in this episode...

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,949
don't exist in real life. We ask for your understanding.

00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,138
High-Ranking Bank Employees Found Guilty of Helping Launder Money

10
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,578
A bank's branch manager and deputy manager...

11
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,949
who aided a group to launder...

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,578
a large amount of money...

13
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,339
by deleting their transactions...

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,299
from the flagged list so they'd avoid suspicion...

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,579
were in court today.

16
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,818
A crucial witness statement...

17
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:56,178
got most of the prosecution's evidence accepted,

18
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:57,379
and the manager and deputy manager...

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,699
- who managed the funds... - How come...

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,259
were found guilty.

21
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:05,420
Employee Suspicious of the Funds Files a Report

22
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:07,259
Hello?

23
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,100
I'll do as commanded, Your Excellency.

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,380
Do you think you won again?

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,660
You will die by my hand.

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,660
Let go of me!

27
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,979
The bishop has instructed me.

28
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:40,020
I am to lock you up in the punishment room.

29
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,059
There's only one way to guarantee Lee's safety.

30
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,660
It's to get him to court...

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,189
so he can testify.

32
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,578
Until he testifies in court,

33
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:42,819
we must get everyone to focus on us.

34
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,380
Get them to focus on us?

35
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,220
I must walk into the tiger's jaw, then.

36
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,298
It could be more dangerous than we think.

37
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:53,500
Mr. Kim, you're the one in the deepest danger among us.

38
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:55,339
She's right.

39
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,219
Once they find out everything,

40
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,739
they won't let you be.

41
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,418
Once Lee Si Wan's safety is guaranteed,

42
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,340
I'll think about how I can escape from here.

43
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:15,699
I don't see a way out of here.

Final Episode

47
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,939
Congratulations on getting released.

48
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,579
The past two years must have been tough.

49
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,620
You must have been busy, Ha Jun.

50
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,619
The chapel is getting built in the backyard.

51
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,900
No. I already have a place in mind.

52
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,579
A place where ignorant people cannot just barge in.

53
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,698
I wonder if the Almighty made me suffer,

54
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,979
so he could show it to me.

55
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:26,019
Therefore, you will not suffer at all.

56
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,619
I am told by the Almighty that you will rise up even more.

57
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,059
In your own places,

58
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,100
you will soar to the peak to change the world.

59
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:38,619
So I ask you to keep one thing in mind.

60
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,460
Remember where you came from,

61
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,580
who put you...

62
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:49,619
in these positions, and why.

63
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:58,499
Amen.

64
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:00,269
- Amen. - Amen.

65
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,340
- Amen. - Amen.

66
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:08,379
The day Lee Si Wan appeared in court

67
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:11,900
Wouldn't you say I had given you more than enough chances?

68
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,150
Your Excellency, please grant me one more chance.

69
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:27,859
Let's pray quietly and wait for an answer.

70
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:08,700
How could he be so weak?

71
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,780
Even the mighty Manager On...

72
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,780
ended up in the lowly punishment room.

73
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,100
Let me promise you something.

74
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,539
Once I get out of here,

75
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:53,779
I'll kill you and everyone who has anything to do with you.

76
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,019
I will find everyone whom you have helped...

77
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,900
at least once and kill them myself.

78
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,739
The uniform suits you.

79
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,499
Excuse me.

80
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:39,780
Can you cut the steak for me?

81
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,539
I don't have any energy to lift my arm.

82
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,900
Blame my old age.

83
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:50,580
Thank you.

84
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Oh, my back.

85
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,700
One, two, three.

86
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,739
Handling nine is over my head.

87
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,699
Yes. Thank you for your hospitality.

88
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,580
Why don't I invite you over to my house next time?

89
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Have a good day, everyone.

90
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,580
Don't stand there! Get him!

91
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,429
Mr. Jang.

92
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,189
You haven't been returning our calls.

93
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,309
My phone died.

94
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,059
Those jerks. Charging his phone...

95
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,619
is the least they can do after kidnapping him.

96
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,190
What about Kim? Can you reach him?

97
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,738
Our communication is still down.

98
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:40,429
Maybe, his battery is running low too.

99
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,310
To rescue him,

100
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,139
we need to be able to talk to him.

101
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,018
- I'll go. - Go where?

102
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,100
- To give him the battery. - They'll catch you if you go in.

103
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:50,979
There's a way not to get caught.

104
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,820
What do you see?

105
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:59,699
Have you been well?

106
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,978
What are you smuggling inside today?

107
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:05,019
Gosh. Come on. Lower your voice!

108
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,739
It's all right.

109
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,259
I would like it if you can get this inside.

110
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:14,619
Thanks.

111
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,340
I know you're good at this. Keep up the good work!

112
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,978
It's time for your snack.

113
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:22,378
Don't eat it up because it's tasty.

114
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,550
Make sure to eat it with water.

115
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,059
Jangsan Correctional

117
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,100
Seriously. I can't believe I'm delivering this. Goodness.

118
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:37,940
Here's the red bean bun for your snack.

119
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Go Eun.

120
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,459
Mr. Kim.

121
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,859
Is everything okay? Are you hurt?

122
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,340
I'm afraid not. I'm pretty banged up.

123
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,459
Gosh. We were all so worried.

124
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,618
But me the most.

125
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:19,340
I'm glad we can reach you now.

126
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:22,820
We were trying to come up with an escape plan for you.

127
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,100
No, don't bother.

128
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,499
What do you mean?

129
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,700
I'm not leaving this place.

130
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,340
- What? - I'll stay.

131
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:35,219
What are you talking about?

132
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,898
Don't you know how dangerous that place is?

133
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,179
I'm with them on this.

134
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,018
Getting out of there as soon as possible...

135
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,019
should be your priority.

136
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,738
You of all people know...

137
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,859
that the warden and guards are all in on this.

138
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,378
That makes it even better.

139
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,700
In what world can this be better for you?

140
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:51,060
A place where outsiders can't easily infiltrate.

141
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,060
The people here are on their payroll...

142
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,618
which ironically means that it's a safe place...

143
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:56,700
protected by law and governmental authority.

144
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:58,739
This place...

145
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,540
must be their sanctum.

146
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,499
Their sanctum?

147
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:07,379
Mr. Kim, don't tell me that...

148
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:08,898
This is the perfect moment...

149
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,979
since Lee Si Wan's testimony cut off their funds.

150
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,580
We need to corner them a little bit more.

151
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,340
How should we do it?

152
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,820
Mr. Choi, Mr. Park, and Go Eun.

153
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:22,859
You three need to be my arms and legs.

154
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:26,059
Please get me...

155
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,060
the foreign currency transactions report...

156
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,060
that Lee Si Wan submitted.

157
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:32,019
We will now block off the pipes that they get their money from.

158
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,899
By blocking off their financial sources,

159
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,898
you want those hidden in the background to surface.

160
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,060
That's your idea.

161
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,700
If you block off one's air supply, they're bound to come up for air.

162
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,939
Kim, while you block off their air supply,

163
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,580
I'll take care of another matter.

164
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,100
There's something I must look into.

165
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:51,659
Sure.

166
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:54,779
What is it?

167
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,699
We gathered here today to forge an escape plan for Kim,

168
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,299
but he's thinking about getting these people...

169
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,139
while being held captive.

170
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:04,060
You really need to take better care of yourself.

171
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,700
Then,

172
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,619
let us begin.

U-Dex

189
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:03,819
Even with the source of funds...

190
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,899
that Lee Si Wan managed to report,

191
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,460
there are still many left in play.

192
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,779
We don't need to block all the pipes.

193
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:13,979
Blocking the 1 or 2 most critical ones...

194
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,739
will be effective enough.

195
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,060
Antiques exchange market

196
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:21,859
The antiques exchange market.

197
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,700
Despite its humble size,

198
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,498
it deals with many companies overseas.

199
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:26,979
E and G, Briss

200
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:28,259
Antiques?

201
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,419
Antiques...

202
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,300
There we go. They have way too much operational funds.

203
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:38,539
Won't it be dangerous with all the heightened security?

204
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,618
That would be the case if we were after the money.

205
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:43,539
But our goal is to stop the money from flowing.

206
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,859
I doubt it'll be that hard.

207
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,220
How could we do it?

208
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:50,979
Having one of the antiques stolen before the auction...

209
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,259
will seriously hurt them.

210
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:54,778
Are you telling us to steal it?

211
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,658
As if anything's new.

212
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,059
But we'll have to infiltrate a facility...

213
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
that will be on high alert...

214
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,378
without Mr. Kim.

215
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:03,059
Rather than going inside, you'll wait outside.

216
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,060
Outside?

217
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:06,300
Schedule

218
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,379
There's an antique scheduled to be auctioned off today.

219
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,060
Mr. Choi and Mr. Park.

220
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,859
Can I leave you two to handle it?

221
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,220
Of course. Let us handle it.

222
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,739
Us?

223
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,060
Don't just stand there and hurry up. Come on.

224
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
Wish you luck.

Thank you.

232
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:51,580
Goodness.

233
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:53,779
Gosh.

234
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:57,019
Goodness.

235
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,859
- Have a good day, then. - Have a good day.

236
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,060
Have a good day, guys.

237
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,579
Walk slowly if you must.

238
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,459

244
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:21,979
We received your call.

245
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,739
- Our call? - Yes, you requested our service.

246
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,460
That's right. You called us.

247
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,420
Third-tier lender

248
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,060
This is the company they deal with the most.

249
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,499
When wiring money overseas that can't go through a bank,

250
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,220
this is who they turn to.

251
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:40,659
Illegal foreign exchange transaction.

252
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,258
The transactions being illegal...

253
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:43,778
is why they're strict in terms of their clients.

254
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:44,859
That's right.

255
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,100
Even at Paradise Credit History,

256
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:48,498
the computer with all the client's personal files...

257
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:49,739
weren't hooked to an external network...

258
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,259
to prevent it from being hacked.

259
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,619
Should the client list on the computer...

260
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,738
disappear...

261
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,460
They'll have a mental breakdown.

262
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,379
I'll pay them a visit.

263
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,219
Black Capital

264
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,990
My baby. How sweet of you.

265
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,990
You seem like a woman of power. How can I be of help today?

266
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,020
I'm here to borrow money.

267
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,379
Have I come to the right place?

268
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,340
You sure have.

269
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,779
How much do you need?

270
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,820
A hundred dollars.

271
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,540
Did you say 100 dollars?

272
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,138
- Yes, 100 dollars. - Why is that?

273
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:33,179
With the 100 dollars, I'll buy you delicious treats.

274
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,659
Selling one of the items you have will get you more than that.

275
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,859
My gosh. Not my babies.

276
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:42,219
Anyway, hand me the money.

277
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,138
With the 100 dollars, I'll buy you treats.

278
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,219
Here you go.

279
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:49,219
Shouldn't I sign a contract?

280
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,379
Black Capital

281
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,820
Don't you need my seal?

282
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,019
Where could my seal be?

283
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,299
I'd rather sign it though.

284
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,899
Actually, let's just stamp my seal on it.

285
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,898
I'd prefer to sign it. Forget it. I'll get you my seal.

286
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:08,938
Sweetie, hold on, will you?

287
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:11,060
It's very cramped in here.

288
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:13,898
Dalbong, I bet you want to go for a walk.

289
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:16,059
Baby, where did I put my seal?

290
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,779
I didn't bring it?

291
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,580
How could I come here without it?

292
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:21,340
I'd rather not borrow the money.

293
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,020
Good day, then.

294
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:24,419
Let's go, Dalbong.

295
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,139
My sweetie.

296
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,270
What just happened?

297
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,300
Rainbow Department Store

298
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:37,300
My gosh.

299
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,339
Here you go.

300
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,750
Good boy.

301
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,858
You have no idea how heavy this is.

302
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,339
I made the smallest device I could that could handle degaussing.

303
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,379
I can't make it any lighter.

304
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:49,458
Dalbong was heavy as well.

305
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,580
- Dalbong, here you go. - Hold still, Dalbong.

306
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,300
What's going on? Where are all our files?

307
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:58,939
The data on our hard drive have been erased!

308
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,060
What?

309
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,780
What did you just say?

310
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,060
The money is yet to be processed?

311
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,300
Go...

312
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,540
Yes, Your Excellency.

313
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,060
Bring Kim Do Gi...

314
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:37,780
to me.

315
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,459
Establish Law and Order with Respect for People

316
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:09,379
It seems as though I'll have to visit him myself.

317
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,859
You want to visit Mr. Kim?

318
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,299
They'll take you right away.

319
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,219
I doubt they will kill me.

320
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,820
Besides, it's not Kim who I'm about to visit.

321
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:19,580
Who, then?

322
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,218
Don't worry too much even if you can't reach me.

323
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:23,419
I'll be fine.

324
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,270
But Mr. Jang!

325
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,060
Ready

326
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,899
Inmate 5283.

327
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,899
You have a special visitor.

328
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,750
Is there any milk?

329
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,939
Shouldn't you have asked to see Kim Do Gi instead?

330
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,419
Either way,

331
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,178
I'm honoured that you came to see me...

332
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,659
when I needed you the most.

333
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:52,060
I have disappointed my elders, you see.

334
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,219
Thanks to you, I will be able to save face.

335
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:12,859
I was aware of the consequences,

336
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:14,659
but I had to come.

337
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,580
You had to come?

338
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,780
Because you have a right to know the truth.

339
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:42,580
Jangsan Correctional

340
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,340
Mr. Kim called it.

341
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,060
I guess they are in too deep.

342
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,780
You're getting the plate numbers of the cars, right?

343
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,500
Of course. I didn't even miss a car. I got all of them.

344
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,980
What are you doing? Eat up.

345
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,899
But do I have to eat this?

346
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:16,820
You must eat the tofu. That way, no one will suspect us.

347
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,780
Let me know when you finish that. I'll give you another one.

348
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,179
What?

349
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,619
Hey, you. Do you want some tofu?

350
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:26,859
Gosh, that guy.

351
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,379
Come on. Eat up.

352
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,699
Regular Service at Jangsan Correctional

353
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:08,060
I didn't think I'd meet a passenger here.

354
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,020
I underestimated you.

355
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:14,659
Had I known your capabilities, I would have finished you sooner.

356
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:18,020
My mistake of underestimating you was quite costly.

357
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,739
You gave me the wrong destination on purpose.

358
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,060
I don't know how to charge you for the taxi fare.

359
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,699
This has never happened to me.

360
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,899
Regular Service at Jangsan Correctional

361
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:34,740
Let me tell you your last moment on earth.

362
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:36,939
I'm good at reading fortune too.

363
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,980
You see, I used to be a fortune-teller.

364
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,419
According to my reading,

365
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:47,060
you will end up paying a lot of money for the taxi fare.

366
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,500
It will be an exorbitant taxi fare.

367
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,899
You escaped today...

368
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,459
because you couldn't handle being in prison.

369
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,500
You hid in a remote area to look for a way out of this.

370
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,699
Then armed prison guards found you.

371
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,740
And you were shot to death.

372
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,580
Your death will be tragic and meaningless.

373
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,740
Just like your mother.

374
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:28,020
I want you to pay the taxi fare now.

375
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:31,859
With your life.

376
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:34,179
Grab him.

377
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,379
Mom!

378
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,340
Gosh. This is nothing.

379
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,219
You can't even overcome this pathetic trauma of yours.

380
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:35,980
Why kid yourself that you can help people?

381
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,459
I will take care of it as you instructed.

382
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,658
You can also take care of his boss...

383
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,419
who practically gave himself up to us.

We can clean dirty, stained clothes and make them brand-new.

389
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:33,980
Isn't that Mr. Kim?

390
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,378
Really? I think I saw Mr. Jang in there.

391
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:38,379
What?

392
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:41,218
I think Mr. Kim left prison.

393
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:42,740
It was Mr. Kim!

395
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:51,059
They just launched a full-scale investigation on us.

396
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,698
Now that there is no inflow of funds,

397
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:55,060
the damage we're facing is too severe to handle.

398
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:59,020
We must do everything we can to fix this, Your Excellency.

399
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:02,060
Please give us a solution.

400
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,739
We must come up with a solution.

401
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,499
- We need a solution. - How can we fix this?

402
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,739
- We've been working so hard. - We ought to!

403
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,540
- This is unbelievable. - Quiet.

404
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,419
Just because you're in high places,

405
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,580
you must think that you are in control.

406
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,780
As I put you in such places,

407
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,899
I can bring you down as well.

408
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,780
Watch your tongue and show me respect.

409
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:36,379
And do not worry.

410
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,780
Or feel insecure.

411
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:41,859
You will not face any hardships.

412
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,139
I have already prepared a sacrificial lamb...

413
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:47,260
to take your places.

414
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,260
- Amen. - Amen.

415
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,219
A car is tailing them.

416
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:01,899
How ignorant they are.

417
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,300
Handle them at once.

Despite knowing what would happen to me,

436
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:50,820
I had to come.

437
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:54,540
Because you have the right to know the truth too.

Looking for a Missing Child, Kim Dan Woo

439
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,820
Over a decade ago,

440
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,179
I met your parents through Blue Bird Foundation.

441
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,938
You were running around the playground...

442
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:26,939
in front of your house.

443
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:32,060
Then one day, someone had taken you, and you were gone.

446
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:43,300
Went missing from the playground in Iyeong 3-dong, Gangbuk-Gu, Seoul

447
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,020
I heard that you can't even remember your name.

449
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:53,138

How does one record that incident?

451
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:58,780
You must always win the fight.

452
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:01,218
Otherwise, your enemy will have a chance to define you...

453
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:03,500
and tell people that you are evil.

454
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,139
You're On Ha Jun starting today.

455
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,019
You must fight evil...

456
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,499

460
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,379

was seen here.

Ha Jun, you're growing much faster than I expected.

484
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,940
You have become stronger today. To celebrate that,

485
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,909
I'll give you a present.

A father was out looking for his child.

490
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:35,339

So what?

495
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,299
What am I supposed to do about this now?

496
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:02,259
Mr. Kim!

497
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,869
Mr. Jang, are you all right?

498
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,500
- Yes. - We have five.

499
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,699
Five is the magic number.

500
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Aim.

501
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:19,259

Guys...

504
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:24,699
I had fun while it lasted.

505
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,698
No, there's still a way.

506
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:28,219
Stay alert, will you?

507
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:30,619
Think of a way out of this.

508
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:33,178
I doubt there is one.

509
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:34,429
But Gyeong Gu!

510
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:37,619

What's going on?

518
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:42,539
Who was driving that when the five of us were here?

519
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,460

Ms. Driver, does that pager actually work?

523
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:37,909
Really?

524
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:45,060
Please come again.

525
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,540
I thought you were never going to call me again.

526
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:50,500
I figured you were doing fine on your own.

527
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:51,909
Thank you for making the trip.

528
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,540
Are you still worried about others being hurt?

529
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,580
Say hello, guys.

530
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:04,779
She was the first driver of the deluxe taxi.

531
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,100
What?

532
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:17,909
Thank you for helping us.

533
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,659
I do not wish to reprimand you...

534
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:44,060
because you have never once disappointed me before.

535
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,099
You have never done wrong,

536
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,339
so of course you don't know how to take responsibility.

537
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,580
I remember how brightly you smiled...

538
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:55,500
when we built a new building where the welfare home was.

539
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,019
A tremendous amount of damage was caused...

540
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,219
which has stirred many complaints.

541
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:06,908
Some of the local corporations are now targets of an investigation...

542
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:08,659
which has people wondering about them.

543
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,299
I'd like this incident...

544
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:14,179
to teach you how to take responsibility.

545
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:18,738
What you should say to the prosecutor...

546
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,219
has already been written down for you.

547
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:23,460
Pray quietly and you will be answered.

548
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:30,580
Your Excellency, I'm afraid there's trouble.

549
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,619
Please spare my life.

550
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:46,779
Spare your life?

551
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,909
Then explain why I should keep you alive.

552
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:52,389
I...

553
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:02,940
I will gladly accept the punishment you give me.

554
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:07,500
So that all the blame is targeted my way,

555
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:09,869
I will take your place...

556
00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:13,339
and take the fall as the man in charge.

557
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,580
I only ask for one thing in return.

558
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,429
Kim Do Gi...

559
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,219
Let me be the one to kill him.

560
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:26,940
I will put an end...

561
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:29,460
to our feud.

562
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:36,179
Mr. Jang told me a while back...

563
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:38,619
that there was someone who drives nastier than I do.

564
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:41,020
I also heard a lot from him,

565
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:43,339
The first Deluxe Driver.

566
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,299
Thank you for helping us out.

567
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,100
On Ha Jun

568
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,739
Do you accept clients like me?

569
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,540
What did he want?

570
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:29,299
He wants to put an end to our battle.

571
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:31,380
Take it.

572
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:36,460
I was going to drive you home since you seemed tired,

573
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:38,179
but I don't think that's where you're headed.

574
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,219
One should see the end of a battle.

575
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,979
Don't you dare say you're doing this alone.

576
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,019
She's right.

577
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,139
You being alone worries me.

578
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:51,420
Fine. Let's all go together.

579
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,540
Mr. Jang, you must feel reassured.

580
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,339
I'd rather be the one to make them feel that way.

581
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,218
Thank you for making the long trip.

582
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:02,579
Let me drive you to the airport.

583
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,020
Don't be ridiculous.

584
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,139
You should operate with those people as well.

585
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:08,380
They're off to end the battle.

586
00:45:09,779 --> 00:45:10,818
Get going, then.

587
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:12,380
I'll wrap this up before I go.

588
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:14,940
Okay. Thanks for your help.

589
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:18,698
All right. Shall we get going?

590
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:19,699
Yes.

591
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:21,179
Let's go.

592
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,380
Deluxe

593
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:34,619
Second Chance Laundry

594
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:45,299
Deluxe

595
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:07,020
Deluxe

596
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:12,860
Deluxe

597
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,060
Ministry of Justice

598
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,900
Come with me.

599
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,860
Realize a just society.

600
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,739
I was worried that you might not show up.

601
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:21,420
I should put an end to this.

602
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,860
I will do my best to do the same.

603
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:43,219
It's cold. Why don't you watch it through the monitor?

604
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,060
Sometimes, I want to see a man die in person.

605
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,900
Go back inside. It's cold out here.

606
00:49:20,299 --> 00:49:22,299
Realize a just society.

607
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,100
Is this what you wanted?

608
00:49:39,139 --> 00:49:40,860
You were right.

609
00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:45,179
Some things must be remembered to get them back.

610
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:52,219
Had I met you guys first,

611
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,219
would my life have been different?

612
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,619
However it might have changed,

613
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,219
it would've been better than this.

614
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:16,339
Kim Dan Woo.

615
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:21,380
So that was your real name?

616
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:23,980
It's a good name.

617
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:51,779
Thanks for taking my case, Do Gi.

618
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,299
Do you accept clients like me too?

619
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:03,540
I want to end this fight.

620
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,259
Help me find my name back.

621
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,259
How weak he is.

622
00:51:23,139 --> 00:51:25,020
I will end this fight myself.

623
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:35,699
What?

624
00:52:26,299 --> 00:52:27,299
Ha Jun.

625
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:30,299
How...

626
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:33,779
dare you?

627
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,540
Mr. On.

628
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,539
If you get in an accident, get yourself checked out.

629
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,619
Do that first. Got it?

630
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,580
Thank you.

631
00:53:25,659 --> 00:53:28,060
Sir, what should I do?

632
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,460
Sir.

633
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:41,778
- What's this sound? - What?

634
00:53:41,779 --> 00:53:42,860
What's going on?

635
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,339
What is this sound?

636
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,379
- What is this? - What on earth is this?

637
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,899
The bishop is dead? What's going on?

638
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,019
- What is this? - How could this be?

639
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,298
- What is this? - He's dead?

640
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:56,459
- We should leave. - What?

641
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,539
- Gosh. - Let's go.

642
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,339
The bishop is dead!

643
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:13,219
What is this?

644
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,500
I can't open the door!

645
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:21,699
I can't open it.

646
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:23,618
I'm dying in here.

647
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:25,420
Is anyone outside?

648
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,618
Help us!

649
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:29,739
- Open up! - Open the door!

650
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:31,380
Open the door.

651
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:42,738
What's going on? It won't open.

652
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:43,819
Let me try.

653
00:54:44,259 --> 00:54:46,658
Forget it! Let's use the path in the back of the kitchen.

654
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:48,460
- Check the back! - Check it.

655
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:52,060
They're going to the kitchen.

656
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:55,219
Was there a path there too?

657
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:05,179
Prison blueprint

658
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,179
There was. But not anymore.

659
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,339
How come all the doors are locked?

660
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,100
Establish order when walking in groups.

661
00:55:45,819 --> 00:55:47,980
Let's talk it out.

662
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,420
- Spare us! - No!

663
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,540
Ministry of Justice

664
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,139
Would it kill you to move faster?

665
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,659
What about the others?

666
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:11,900
We dealt with them like you suggested.

667
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,460
Darn it.

668
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,460
What the...

669
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:25,139
Hey!

670
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,338
- A person is locked in here. - Get me out of here!

671
00:57:28,339 --> 00:57:29,899
- Get me out of here! - I'm locked in here!

672
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,499
- Open this door! - Let me out!

673
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,900
- Let me out. - Why am I in here?

674
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,939
- Open this door! - Hurry!

675
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,699
- Get me out of here. - Hurry!

676
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,460
- Help! - Get me out of here.

677
00:57:38,779 --> 00:57:41,779
- Help! - Someone's locked in here!

678
00:57:44,619 --> 00:57:46,699
I'm driving, so get in the back.

679
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:48,860
I'm calling shotgun.

680
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,020
Deluxe

681
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,060
Where to, sir?

682
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,860
Take us to the place that brought us joy.

683
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,739
Do you know where that is?

684
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,738
I'll drive you safely to your destination.

685
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:26,940
It seems that she knows.

686
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:30,380
The 5283 beginning service.

687
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,299
Establish Law and Order with Respect for People

688
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,258
"Taxi" by Park Ji Woong

689
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:52,659
Take me to the place that brought me joy

690
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:02,060
One year later

691
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,819
Hand me the screwdriver.

692
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,940
Sure.

693
00:59:13,779 --> 00:59:14,900
There's no leak...

694
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,499
and everything's good with the underbody.

695
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,258
Underbody, check.

696
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:20,739
All this lying down...

697
00:59:21,619 --> 00:59:22,778
is making my knees hurt.

698
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:24,178
Can you get me one of those?

699
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:27,299
- Don't you have hands of your own? - I don't.

700
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:29,779
Fine. I'll let you have the last one.

701
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,980
Wait. One should be left.

702
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,060
Where's my tonic?

703
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:44,219
There isn't one.

704
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,299
Where did it suddenly go?

705
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,540
It was here, but now it's gone.

706
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:52,659
Seriously?

707
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,618
- You... - I didn't drink it though.

708
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:56,299
I didn't drink it.

709
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,940
Why you...

710
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:09,900
What are you doing out here?

711
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,659
Are you just getting home?

712
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,580
- Aren't you cold? - I'm enjoying the chilly breeze.

713
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,659
Do you know what I missed the most after moving out?

714
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,459
Having a bottle of beer out here after work...

715
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,819
while enjoying the nightscape.

716
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:29,259
It's nice to be a tenant here again.

717
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:31,139
I want to come here every day.

718
01:00:32,139 --> 01:00:33,179
Is that so?

719
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,540
That reminds me.

720
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:39,739
Mr. Kim.

721
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:47,699
Cheers.

722
01:00:58,179 --> 01:00:59,299
Did you know...

723
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,500
that 30cm is the distance one can maintain...

724
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:07,179
while socially feeling close to someone?

725
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:11,738
Being more than 30cm apart will make you seem nonchalant,

726
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:14,380
and being closer than that will be too in-your-face.

727
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:17,339
At times, the distance can also be scary.

728
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,739
You moved back here after living more than 30cm away.

729
01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:23,659
I doubt we're indifferent to one another.

730
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,900
When we clinked our bottles a second ago,

731
01:01:30,779 --> 01:01:34,179
the gap between us was less than 30cm.

732
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,339
About 25cm.

733
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,060
But it didn't make me uncomfortable,

734
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,259
nor was I scared.

735
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,179
I'm just saying so.

but committed suicide...

742
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,899
after being threatened and conciliated...

743
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,178
following her report to the authorities.

744
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:30,059
Proof of the base covering up the incident...

745
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,338
and even fabricating associated evidence...

746
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:33,939
have sent ripples across the country.

756
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,139
Could he know what happened?

757
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,380
What could he do with the truth anyway?

758
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,380
I guess.

759
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,500
If he digs up the truth, we'll be burying another corpse.

760
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,060
Exactly.
