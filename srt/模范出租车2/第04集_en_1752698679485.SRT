00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:31,818
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,419
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,939
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,630
Episode 4

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,139
Is something wrong?

10
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,060
My goodness.

11
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:58,660
How did you end up like this?

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,818
The smoke is relentless.

13
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:03,940
Is there a car center near here?

14
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:07,219
Do you think we wouldn't have a place like that near here?

15
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:09,058
Where is it?

16
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:10,299
- So... - Yes?

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,618
If you go straight down this way on this side,

18
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:13,939
- you'll see an intersection. - An intersection.

19
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,058
From there, turn at the persimmon tree, go left for 20m,

20
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:20,179
right for 30m, and go around diagonally,

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,259
you'll see it.

22
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,539
Okay, then. Good luck.

23
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,140
How will we get all the way there?

24
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,699
Should we have called a tow truck?

25
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,740
Hey. Push.

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,860
Are you going to stay here? Hurry up and push, you punk.

27
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,220
Hey! You should push too.

28
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,060
Darn it.

29
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,019
Push faster.

30
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,659
Good job.

31
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,470
Rainbow Agricultural Machinery

32
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,500
Stop.

Rainbow Agricultural Machinery

34
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:32,630
Is there anyone here?

35
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,910
Is anyone inside?

36
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,780
Yes. Welcome.

37
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:46,470
What? Is this your place?

38
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,699
Can't you tell?

39
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,220
Then you could've towed our car here.

40
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,739
You should've asked me to tow your car.

41
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,818
Do you need people to spell it out for you?

42
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,138
Couldn't you just tell by the situation?

43
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:00,259
My gosh.

44
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:02,738
Then put the car back and ask me to pick it up.

45
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,139
I'll go and tow it.

46
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:09,900
Forget it.

47
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,818
- Just hurry up and fix it. - I can't.

48
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,979
You said you can fix cars here.

49
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,060
Take a look at this.

50
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:19,739
All of these are waiting in line.

51
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,859
You need to wait your turn.

52
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,979
- How much for the repairs? - Just give me 100 dollars.

53
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,779
Here. Can you do it right away?

54
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,779
I told you it was 100 dollars. Why are you giving me so much?

55
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,380
Plus, I can't do it right away.

56
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,939
- Just do it right away. - I told you I can't.

57
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,379
Darn it. How much do you want?

58
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,018
I want 100 dollars.

59
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,459
How many times must I tell you?

60
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,619
My gosh.

61
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,180
Hey. Push the car.

62
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,219
I'm not getting the car fixed here, so start pushing.

63
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,579
- Hey... - Let go!

64
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,340
Hey!

65
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:59,780
We're in a rush. Is there no way?

66
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,059
You're in a rush?

67
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,698
We need to get to town to put on a show for the elders.

68
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,299
- Can you please help us? - A show?

69
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,460
You should've told me that sooner!

70
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,900
Money isn't the issue here.

71
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,460
When it comes to people, it's all about sincerity.

72
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,940
Don't you agree?

73
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,378
I'll go get the parts,

74
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,150
so bring your car right to the front.

75
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,178
Gosh, that stupid bumpkin.

76
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:33,020
He wouldn't even listen to a word I said.

77
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,580
Get out.

78
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,020
Get everything ready. Let's start in the afternoon.

79
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,299
- Okay. - Okay.

80
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:47,539
They said they'd get started in the afternoon.

81
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,539
Then should we get started too?

82
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:51,299
Okay.

83
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,538
I'm everyone's Sang Gi. I'm your Sang Gi.

84
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,739
I am Yoo Sang Gi. Hello.

85
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,858
Nice!

86
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:06,179
Mother, Father. I love you!

87
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,379
I sent you the text message.

88
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,710
A Party To Wish You a Long and Healthy Life

89
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,710
I'm so sorry, sir. I got too excited.

90
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:24,099
Whether it's during the day

91
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,900
Or during the night

92
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,418
I'll run to you at any time

93
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,780
Okay. The person in first place is...

94
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,819
- Number 27! - Darn it!

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,780
Number 27!

96
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,179
I'm number 27!

97
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,738
Thank you.

98
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:46,580
I never win these things.

99
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,379
Nice!

100
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,820
Goodness.

101
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,580
Congratulations.

102
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,140
How nice!

103
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,220
Go and have a seat.

104
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:04,179
Right. Don't you want more?

105
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:05,379
- Yes. - Yes.

106
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,339
That's why we prepared part two!

107
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,858
- We prepared a part 2! - A part 2!

108
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:11,378
- Part 2. - Part 2.

109
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,858
We prepared even bigger gifts in part two,

110
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:17,140
so please be excited for it!

111
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,739
Oh, my.

112
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,260
Mom, let's take a selfie. Ready?

113
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,179
Say, cheese!

114
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:33,660
Yoo Sang Gi's Cellphone Details

115
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:41,099
Have some of this.

116
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,499
- Gosh, I know. - Right.

117
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,298
Okay.

118
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:46,618
Who's going to win the prize this time?

119
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:47,780
It's big!

Number five!

125
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,460
Number five! Gosh!

126
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:07,260
I won!

127
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,058
I won! Hurray for my brother!

128
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,739
Hurray for Yang Min Woo!

129
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,660
Do you want to die?

130
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,539
Hey!

131
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,299
Aren't you going to do your job right?

132
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,139
I'll bring them right over from the market tomorrow,

133
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,418
so prepare for it properly.

134
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,939
Don't you dare do a half-hearted job again, you punks.

135
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,460
Okay!

136
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,099
These sweet potatoes...

137
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,139
were hand picked in the forest by Grandpa Oh Bok!

138
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,379
These are sweet potatoes!

139
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,699
- Sweet potatoes! - Sweet potatoes!

140
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,099
- Welcome! - Sweet potatoes!

141
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
We can do this!

142
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,738
- Sweet potatoes! - Are these sweet potatoes?

143
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,220
- Sweet potatoes! - Sweet potatoes!

144
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:56,660
Goodness.

145
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,020
Gosh, they're so dedicated.

146
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,859
We were even more dedicated.

147
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,700
Come and take a look!

148
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,618
Don't lose your energy.

149
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:15,460
Even if you're not hungry, be sure to eat.

150
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,938
Tomorrow's the death anniversary of my son,

151
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:23,579
so I'm going to make a lot of delicious food for him.

152
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,779
It's the one day in a year that you get to see him,

153
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,459
so you should prepare the most delicious dishes for him.

154
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,498
Hold on.

155
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,938
I brought some vegetables.

156
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,260
Hold on, Father.

157
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,259
This is a gift.

158
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,430
You just need to pay the Public Utilities' Charge and Tax.

159
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,459
Even if you explain it to me, I have no idea what you're saying.

160
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,619
- You should just do it for me. - Me?

161
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,618
Then do you happen to have a small card?

162
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:56,258
Yes. I do.

163
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,190
Here it is.

164
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,339
You can hold onto the cash.

165
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,019
I'll take care of this for you.

166
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:08,060
Max out his card and set it to 12 instalments.

167
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,460
What is all of this?

168
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,060
Are you selling something?

169
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:22,379
Failure to verify, Device cannot be used

170
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:29,189
This will shut down all transmissions.

171
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,549
This will shut everything down.

172
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,139
There is one precaution.

173
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,460
What is it?

174
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,940
The distance is short.

175
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,899
Failure to verify, Device cannot be used

176
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,059
Sir, this isn't working...

177
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,258
Father's waiting. What are you doing?

178
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,259
Give it to me.

179
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,859
I guess there is no signal.

180
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,700
Sir, give me a second.

181
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,310
Oh, it's working now.

182
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,659
I was going to try one of these. Is this good?

183
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,018
What's wrong with this?

184
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,060
Gosh.

185
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,820
Goodness.

186
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,139
But how do you put this on your back and waist?

187
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,899
I live alone.

188
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,430
Do I put it on like this? Or do I put it on like this?

189
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,099
- Like this? - Why do you keep following me...

190
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,619
and annoying me?

191
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,738
I'm not going to sell it to you, Mister.

192
00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:37,430
Go somewhere else!

193
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:40,779
Oh, my.

194
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,139
My gosh.

195
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,138
Why did you call me "mister?"

196
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,219
I'm a young man who hasn't even gotten married!

197
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,979
Apologize to me.

198
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,550
Apologize.

199
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,420
Darn you!

200
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:06,060
I didn't do anything.

201
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,540
I'll go away now.

202
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:16,499
What's wrong? It's broken.

203
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:18,859
Hey, come back.

204
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,939
Get back here. Fix this!

205
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,138
Hey, you! Come back.

206
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,700
- I said get back... - Calm down.

207
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,420
- He's watching. - Right.

208
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:28,300
- Father. - Take care of this.

209
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,379
It's all good.

210
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,619
Constantly Hiring

211
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,899
Rainbow Transport

212
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,618
The person you reached is...

213
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:49,779
This is so weird. Why won't anyone pick up?

214
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,580
Rainbow Transport

215
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:03,499
Staff Only

216
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,060
Ma'am.

217
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:13,618
You said you left a red wallet in the car?

218
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:15,939
Yes, but I'll come back when someone else is here.

219
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,059
It's fine.

220
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,299
You came all the way. I'll get it for you.

221
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,699
- Okay, then. - Take a seat and wait.

222
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,739
Okay.

223
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:25,979
This is a task for the youngest.

224
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,300
Why are there so many keys?

225
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,340
Lost and Found

226
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,460
What's this?

227
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,100
- What are you doing in here? - What?

228
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,259
I was...

229
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,459
I came in to find someone's lost item...

230
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,978
and this happened.

231
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,940
Oh, yes, that. Let me have a look.

232
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:19,819
This thing,

233
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,459
I meant to hammer in a few nails and I forgot.

234
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,498
I'll find the lady's belongings.

235
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,859
You can get ready to head out.

236
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,700
- Okay. I'll be off, then. - Go on.

237
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,378
I'll do the hammering later.

238
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:36,739
No. I'll take care of it. Don't you mind.

239
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,180
Okay, then.

240
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,499
Deluxe

241
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:00,258
You all did great today.

242
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,499
Tell everyone we're still young.

243
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,619
He makes us do this when we could just buy it.

244
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,820
He never cooks.

245
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,339
Have you ever seen Sang Gi buy anything?

246
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,498
Not once.

247
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:14,139
I'm sick of it. Why must I do this?

248
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,299
You're badmouthing me which means you're full.

249
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,498
It wasn't badmouthing. I was saying you're frugal.

250
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:20,779
Lettuce.

251
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,979
Your hair has grown. I'll pull it all out.

252
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,979
Life starts now! We're 1 year old

253
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,460
Do you have any new information?

254
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:32,619
The granny eating Jeon at the end.

255
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:36,139
She's called Bok Soon and she was recently widowed.

256
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,540
She got her husband's death benefits.

257
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,378
- Any kids? - They never visit,

258
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,139
but they regularly send money.

259
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,340
Find out where she lives.

260
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:51,940
Work harder.

261
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,019
Don't try to slack off.

262
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,579
I looked everywhere...

263
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,459
and they don't save up at all.

264
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,220
There are no accounts in any bank or establishment.

265
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,580
They must spend it all as soon as they con someone.

266
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:09,899
Their spending habits suggest otherwise.

267
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:13,220
They must have the money hidden somewhere.

268
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:15,978
Bok Soon who got the death benefits.

269
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:17,220
We'll move in on her.

270
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,019
Be prepared.

271
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,739
Let's go for a stroll.

272
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,460
Darn it. Why the heck...

273
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:34,580
Why won't it work?

274
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,219
It's not my fault this time.

275
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,420
We had it fixed.

276
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,378
The idiot didn't fix it properly.

277
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,738
I didn't like him at all.

278
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:44,659
- Shall I call him? - No!

279
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,779
Call the emergency hotline.

280
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,658
Yes, I have your location.

281
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:53,700
I'll send someone right away.

282
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,340
We have an emergency.

283
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,899
Emergency Repair

284
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,780
You called the emergency hotline?

285
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,750
Why are you back?

286
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:40,178
I take care of all the emergencies around here.

287
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,540
I got here fast, didn't I?

288
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,619
Wait. Then when we broke down between the paddies,

289
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,300
I could've called my insurance company.

290
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,859
- Yes. - Why didn't you say so?

291
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:53,419
- Say what? - To call my insurance company!

292
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,780
What for?

293
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,060
Is that the truck?

294
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:02,138
A grown adult should fend for himself.

295
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:04,060
Why keep asking others to do his job?

296
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:05,510
You...

297
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,059
- Don't. - Relax.

298
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,379
Let go of me.

299
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:12,580
- No, don't do that. - Hold back!

300
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,509
- Don't do it! - Calm down.

301
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,580
- Just one whack. - No whacks.

302
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,510
- Let's not do this. - You!

303
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,020
Be careful with the brakes!

304
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,510
Grandpa. You came out this far?

305
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:52,820
Wait here.

306
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:55,179
I'll give him a ride too.

307
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,419
Grandpa. I told you not to come this far.

308
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,379
Since you're all alone, don't forget to eat well.

309
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,340
A hundred dollars.

310
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,858
Put that away.

311
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:21,658
Why do you want to pay me whenever I give you a lift?

312
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:24,749
When you lived abroad, Grandpa,

313
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,100
did you always take a taxi?

314
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:34,819
These people are putting on shows around the village.

315
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,780
You should check it out.

316
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,858
You don't have to pay anyone.

317
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:50,060
The ride is free.

318
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,580
Get up.

319
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,939
Come on, help him.

320
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,379
Will you pull harder?

321
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,779
Sang Gi.

322
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,659
- His shoes are expensive, right? - Gucci.

323
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:17,939
I doubt it.

324
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,899
There's no way an old man would wear the real deal out here.

325
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,059
- It is a designer brand. - Goodbye.

326
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,419
I have the same pair.

327
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,060
He cut off the back of those expensive shoes.

328
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,939
That's what they look like.

329
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:34,939
Let's go on our merry way.

330
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,510
Sang Gi.

331
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,899
Will you go straight to Bok Soon's?

332
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,820
Hold on tight!

333
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,219
Get off me, it's hot.

334
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:06,060
Are you home?

335
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,619
Excuse us.

336
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,859
Hello?

337
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,139
Hey, guys.

338
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:30,540
Porsche.

339
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,899
What is this doing...

340
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,659
Sang Gi.

341
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,270
Get over here.

342
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,419
The wood poker for this cauldron...

343
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,139
It's a seven-iron.

344
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:46,019
It's better than mine.

345
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,659
This is what he uses it for?

346
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:50,580
Has he gone mad?

347
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,939
- Sang Gi. - Be quiet.

348
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,619
Hurry up.

349
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:03,899
Look.

350
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,060
What's this?

351
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:09,659
This...

352
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:11,300
Is it expensive?

353
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:13,139
Yes.

354
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:17,619
Run.

355
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,379
Sang Gi, look.

356
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,540
Remember.

357
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,580
A man may die, but not money.

358
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,299
The money you didn't pay off.

359
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,500
Your family...

360
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,619
and all your relatives...

361
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,059
- You and... - Who's he talking to?

362
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,459
I don't know.

363
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,379
You need to know what you're taking.

364
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,020

What?

371
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,459
Failed in Tracing Chairwoman Baek Sung Mi's Slush Fund

372
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:43,020
Jang took fund related documents before going off the grid.

373
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:51,619
The big shot was right in front of me.

374
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,218
I didn't know where to put the nameplate,

375
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,219
so I just left it there.

376
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,379
He found it himself.

377
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,739
If I'd known he was going to find it so easily,

378
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,419
I shouldn't have contemplated where to put it.

379
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,218
We think too much.

380
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:07,379
- We need to think simply, right? - Gosh.

381
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,459
Woobong Station

382
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,740
Are you here for a walk?

383
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
Old man.

384
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:27,500
Do you want me to take you somewhere fun?

385
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,379
Festival for Elders

386
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,418
I love you,

387
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,619
Mothers and Fathers!

388
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:53,458
It's real

389
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,379
It's totally real

390
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,379
The real deal has appeared now

391
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:05,858
It's real

392
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:09,020
It's totally real

393
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,659
I'm going to love you for real

394
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:20,260
There is a lot of fake love in the world

395
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,379
You are the only one I can trust

396
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,618
I wouldn't hesitate to give you my all

397
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:33,619
Good.

398
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:38,379
You're my everything

399
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,580
Bravo.

400
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,060
Sang Gi.

401
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,500
How was the gig?

402
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:56,219
Be quiet.

403
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:58,618
Did you find it?

404
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:01,340
I looked through the old man's house, but couldn't find it.

405
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:03,938
Are you sure you searched thoroughly?

406
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:05,699
We searched twice. It wasn't there.

407
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:07,179
Sang Gi.

408
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,780
I think he hid it in the farm like you said.

409
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:15,458
The old man disappeared. So we went to his house.

410
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:17,419
He brought some stuff again from somewhere.

411
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,060
We're following him from tomorrow.

412
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:03,500
We should go find it too.

413
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:08,340
Motel, rooms available!

414
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,540
Are they trying to ferment their clothes?

415
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,859
Did they spill marinated crabs? What's this smell?

416
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,579
I don't think it's here.

417
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,618
Gosh.

418
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,699
I touched underwear. It's not here.

419
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,219
There's nothing.

420
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:57,179
He was out to dig some greens.

421
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,899
Greens.

422
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:02,899
Sang Gi. Should we just kidnap him and torture him?

423
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,938
If you stomp your feet in water because you can't catch fish,

424
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:07,500
you only make the water muddy.

425
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:10,419
That only works on sane people.

426
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:12,858
Hey. Stop acting up.

427
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:13,899
Yes, sir.

428
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:16,699
Hold on.

429
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,619
That bumpkin was close to that crazy old man.

430
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:23,939
Yes.

431
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:28,260
There was no safe, let alone any cash.

432
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,179
What do we do now?

433
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:34,020
He's more meticulous than I thought.

434
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,300
I should meet him again.

435
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:41,740
Yes.

436
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,459
Yes.

437
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,020
Okay.

438
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,299
Did it break down again?

439
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,340
I'm here for maintenance. Are you available?

440
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,858
Why are you paying me so much for just maintenance?

441
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:59,340
It's a tip for your hard work.

442
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,419
Your sincerity will do.

443
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,939
Life is all about sincerity.

444
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,340
Rainbow Agricultural Machinery

445
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,260
Remember the old man we met before?

446
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:17,939
Are you close to him?

447
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,898
We live in the same neighbourhood.

448
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:23,580
Sometimes I check on him and bring him some food.

449
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,619
Do you know what he does?

450
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:30,499
How would I know what he did before?

451
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,739
But whatever he did,

452
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,699
now he's just a lonely old man who needs help, isn't he?

453
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:39,540
Does he have any land for farming?

454
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:41,659
Land?

455
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,379
I thought I should go help him from time to time.

456
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,899
He doesn't have any land.

457
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,179
He's always covered in soil.

458
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,540
Maybe not.

459
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,459
Maybe he had some land.

460
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,820
I saw him carrying a few red sticks before.

461
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,418
Red sticks?

462
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:04,980
You know, the ones you stick to the ground as a sign.

463
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,699
"This is my land. No trespassing."

464
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,100
You know.

465
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:11,659
Right.

466
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,300
There. I found it!

467
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,540
Is that right?

468
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,060
Hey.

469
00:30:28,219 --> 00:30:29,419
Dig over there.

470
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,698
Don't just dig the same spot. Scatter and dig.

471
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,379
- Stop following me. - What?

472
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:41,699
There are suspicions.

473
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,300
Hey.

474
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:52,899
- Come here. - Did you find it?

475
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,659
Do you see the red flag over there?

476
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,540
Go dig it.

477
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,580
Sang Gi. All we did was dig.

478
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,939
So? Did you find anything?

479
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,419
Stop whining and get to work.

480
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:13,378
Let's eat. I'm starving.

481
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,459
You won't die from skipping one meal.

482
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,458
Get to work now.

483
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,699
- Hurry up. - Come on.

484
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,780
Oh, hot.

485

Rainbow Agricultural Machinery

486
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,379
The red sticks you told me about.

487
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,060
That land didn't belong to the old man.

488
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,539
I never said he had land.

489
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,419
I said he borrowed red sticks.

490
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,179
Why did you tell me something that's not certain?

491
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:52,300
By the way,

492
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,139
why do you keep asking me about his land?

493
00:31:56,939 --> 00:31:59,579
Because I'm worried.

494
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,378
What if he passes out from weeding his farm alone...

495
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,619
in the scorching sun?

496
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,659
No worries.

497
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,740
You don't need to worry about that.

498
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:13,138
- He doesn't weed the farm. - No?

499
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,699
How do you know that?

500
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,780
- Did you see it? - I did.

501
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:19,979
He has an issue now,

502
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,938
but he used to be very healthy.

503
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,499
He used to drive a tractor.

504
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,698
- A tractor? - He borrowed...

505
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:28,178
a tractor and a plow from me for some reason.

506
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,340
The old man...

507
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:33,179
So you're saying he borrowed a tractor to weed his farm?

508
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,579
I drove the tractor...

509
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,340
and put it where he told me to.

510
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:41,539
I asked him, "Grandpa,"

511
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,178
"what are you planting that you need such a deep plow for?"

512
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,260
And he...

513
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,540
refused to tell me.

514
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:58,699
Mr. Kim.

515
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,459
Let me borrow your tractor.

516
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:04,939
At the place where the old man went.

517
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,218
Goodness.

518
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:13,899
How can you eat gukbap without any radish kimchi?

519
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,540
Here. This is my affection for you.

520
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,260
That's right.

521
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,300
When it comes to people, it's all about affection. Right.

522
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:27,459
Right.

523
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:48,300
You don't think he'll ask you to do it for him. Do you?

524
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,340
He doesn't look kind enough to share it with me.

525
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,419
By the way, he came into some money.

526
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:56,219
Money?

527
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:01,658
I'm positive he didn't have that much cash on him that day, but...

528
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:03,219
Let me borrow your tractor.

529
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:08,379
Was there an ATM machine nearby?

530
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,938
Quick search: ATM

531
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:13,339
Not found

532
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,869
There isn't.

533
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,060
I have a hunch.

534
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,299
I'll know for sure once I check something.

535
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,389
So the place where the idiot delivered the tractor...

536
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,460
is that old man's land?

537
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:34,619
My arms are totally weak.

538
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
Why don't we ask him to dig it for us?

539
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,779
You idiot.

540
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,389
What if he finds the money? Will you take responsibility for it?

541
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:42,819
No.

542
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,940
By the way, who will drive this?

543
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:02,060
Don't worry about that.

544
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:03,698
You can go down and take care of your work.

545
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:05,868
If you don't have anyone to drive,

546
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:08,388
I was wondering if I would have to do it for you.

547
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:12,100
- It's okay, so go down. - Okay.

548
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:13,980
I'll get going.

549
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,219
Goodness.

550
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,059
- Hey. - Yes?

551
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,179
Hurry up and start digging.

552
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,659
Do not enter the pasture.

553
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:46,460
Hey, stop!

554
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,540
- Hey! - Hey, come down!

555
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:51,908
We found it!

556
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:53,219
Did you find it?

557
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,619
- Sang Gi! - Hurry up!

558
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:59,460
- We found it! - It's real

559
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,059
- It's totally real - It's totally real

560
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,540
Hurry up.

561
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,980
The real deal has shown up right now

562
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,659
There's one more.

563
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,868
Poop.

564
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:19,060
Why is there poop in here?

565
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:25,658
Oh, my. Hey. Clean this up.

566
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:27,940
Hey, Jjangdol. Try digging someplace else.

567
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:32,100
Clean it up!

568
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:37,819
- What? - Hurry up!

569
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:39,940
What's wrong with this?

570
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,908
- Hey. - What?

571
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,138
This isn't moving.

572
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,179
What?

573
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:47,658
Hey, come down.

574
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:48,779
My gosh.

575
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,940
Hey. You need to turn on the engine. My gosh.

576
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,940
This isn't working. From low to high.

577
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:00,659
Neutral.

578
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:02,388
Gosh, that idiot!

579
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,219
He gave us something that doesn't even work!

580
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:06,060
Darn it!

581
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:14,499
- Sang Gi. - Sang Gi.

582
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Are you okay?

583
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:19,139
Sang Gi.

584
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,580
Oh, no.

585
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:24,699
This is an expensive shirt.

586
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:28,818
- Are you okay? - What?

587
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:29,869
Sang Gi.

588
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:31,339
Over there.

589
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:42,619
The package is over there.

590
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:47,428
The package...

591
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:50,339
Hey!

592
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:52,869
Hey.

593
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:55,580
Change of plans.

594
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:07,059
What are you doing right now?

595
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,219
We'll take care of the old man,

596
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:11,869
so you can go.

597
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,060
I need to give him his dinner.

598
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,980
We'll be the ones to give the lonely, helpless old man...

599
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,060
his dinner.

600
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:21,980
So go home.

601
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:25,500
Oh, okay.

602
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,739
Make sure you take care of him.

603
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:41,429
Will Mr. Jang be okay?

604
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,060
Hey, old man!

605
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:47,020
Where did you get this from?

606
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:51,460
You went somewhere during the day.

607
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,388
That's enough, you punks.

608
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:55,540
The old man's eating. Stop annoying him.

609
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:57,909
Move.

610
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,389
Old man.

611
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:09,389
Do you want to go for a walk to your farm after dinner...

612
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,819
to exercise a little?

613
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,259
We'll take care of you from now on,

614
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:14,909
so don't worry.

615
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,869
I ate some of that.

616
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:27,460
I ate it.

617
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,940
Darn it.

618
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,659
Senility makes you do all sorts of things.

619
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:57,429
Are you okay?

620
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,500
Can you do something?

621
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,338
These people follow me 24 hours a day.

622
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:04,139
They even follow me into the bathroom.

623
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,940
Tell them you want to see a show. I'll take care of them.

624
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:10,178
Dr. Lee's General Store

625
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:11,908
No way. I can't do it.

626
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,218
Mr. Kim asked that one of us go up there.

627
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:17,298
You should go up then.

628
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:18,618
Or you can do it.

629
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:20,218
Our faces have already been exposed.

630
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:21,699
You're the only new face.

631
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,818
You're crazy. How could I do that there...

632
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:24,939
Just thinking about it embarrasses me.

633
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,218
How long are you going to stay inside?

634
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:28,178
You should come out for some fresh air from time to time.

635
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:30,259
No way. I can't do it.

636
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:32,779
- I can't. - You'll do just fine.

637
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:34,659
I can't!

638
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,699
By the way, why did that old man suddenly want to watch a show?

639
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:51,219
He didn't even listen when you sang. Right?

640
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,299
That's why I hired a part-timer.

641
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,259
Why aren't they here yet? Did you hire someone properly?

642
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:57,499
I did.

643
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,540
I purposely chose the closest company from here.

644
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,779
Goodness. I'm so sorry I'm late.

645
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,980
Hello. I'm Eun Yi.

646
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,388
Why were you so late?

647
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:15,339
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

648
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,618
- Hey. - Oh, my.

649
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,698
- Go. - Hurry up and get on stage.

650
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:20,138
Gosh. Okay.

651
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:21,659
I'll get going. Bye.

652
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:27,980
What are you doing, you punk?

653
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,179
Hello!

654
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,869
A Party To Wish You a Long and Healthy Life

655
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,500
Hello! I'm Eun Yi. It's nice to meet you!

656
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:43,939
My cool friend

657
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,699
You're my oldest friend

658
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,738
You always used to laugh

659
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:54,259
At that place

660
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,459
My cool friend

661
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,658
You're my oldest friend

662
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,099
She's doing a great job.

663
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,459
Why did she hate it so much?

664
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,618
I know.

665
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,580
We would've been in trouble if she didn't do it.

666
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:08,389
As expected from Mr. Kim. I knew it.

667
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:14,539
I feel embarrassed,

668
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,738
and I can't even sing that well.

669
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,020
It's okay if you can't sing well.

670
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,980
But right now,

671
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:21,909
you're the only one we have.

672
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:25,460
Well... What can I do...

673
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,389
if I'm the only one we have?

674
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,178
Yes, that's right

675
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,429
Let's bump into each other like that

676
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:44,459
Will you use your best voice

677
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,909
To wish me well?

678
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,818
I'll use my best laugh

679
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,059
When did she make her own choreography?

680
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,739
I know. We didn't even give her that much time.

681
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,908
On the muddy walls

682
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,429
At Mokro Bar today

683
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:09,299
Thirty-watt incandescent lights are swinging

684
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:11,980
Encore! Good job!

685
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:14,980
Thank you!

686
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:19,339
Be careful! Thank you!

687
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:22,139
Oh, gosh. Thank you!

688
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:29,779
- You were pretty good. - Thank you.

689
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:32,338
It's mine.

690
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,060
The old man gave it to me.

691
00:43:37,299 --> 00:43:39,699
I have another job for you.

692
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,940
- Here you go. - Thank you.

693
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,699
That was...

694
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,539
the best show I saw in my life.

695
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,900
Will you stop talking about it?

696
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:58,580
I keep imagining what I looked like.

697
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,619
It makes me blush.

698
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,099
What is Mr. Kim planning next?

699
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,219
He said he'd give the fools some time for self-reflection.

700
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,060
Self-reflection?

701
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,619
Like you said, do you think the old man will tell the girl?

702
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,900
He treated the girl, not at all like how he treated us.

703
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,460
Sang Gi, isn't that the old man's car?

704
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,100
Get out.

705
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,539
What's this car?

706
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,219
The old man gave it to me.

707
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,139
Also, I won't work for you anymore.

708
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,699
Turn off the engine and get out.

709
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:57,258
Get out while we're being nice.

710
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,540
Do you think I don't know what you're up to?

711
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,259
The old man told me everything.

712
00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:07,460
Treasure

713
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:11,460
Because I'm pretty.

714
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:15,739
Darn it.

715
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,419
The truck.

716
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,900
Get in, quick!

717
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,619
Shoot. Get in!

718
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,339
They're coming.

719
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,380
Sang Gi, look.

720
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:34,659
I'll get you. I'll kill you!

721
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,500
They seem to want to kill me.

722
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,299
Rainbow

723
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,499
Hey, you!

724
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,778
Get out of the car!

725
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:47,939
You get out!

726
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,380
What fools. You'll only get hurt.

727
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,698
I see the second bridge.

728
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:54,499
Turn right at it. Don't be nervous.

729
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,540
I'm not nervous.

730
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,379
Sang Gi! She turned right!

731
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,020
- I see that! - Hurry!

732
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,900
That darn part-timer.

733
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:16,219
- I'll get you. - I'm here.

734
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,178
- The tractor. - The idiot.

735
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:26,699
- That... - You!

736
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,218
You idiot.

737
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,500
- Hey! Move! - Get out of the way!

738
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:32,539
- Move it! - Get out of my way!

739
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,500
- You're blocking us! - Move it!

740
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:36,380
Move to the side!

741
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,540
You country-bumpkin idiot!

742
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,460
You're so impatient.

743
00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:48,100
I won't take too long.

744
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,380
What the...

745
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:51,658
Hey!

746
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:52,859
- Hey! - Move it.

747
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,019
You idiot!

748
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,778
- Move to the side! - Go faster!

749
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,218
Sang Gi, look!

750
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:58,258
- It's that way. - There.

751
00:46:58,259 --> 00:46:59,539
- Where? - Go faster!

752
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,379
I want to go faster, okay?

753
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,139
- Get out of the way! - Move it!

754
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:06,138
- Go, just go! - He's moving to the side.

755
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:08,178
You country idiot!

756
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:09,859
Darn you!

757
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,060
Sure. See you.

758
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,699
Dongcheon Quarry 500m, Do Not Enter

759
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,020
Where'd she go?

760
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,460
She must've gotten scared.

761
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,339
She left everything behind.

762
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,580
Sang Gi!

763
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:49,860
Sang Gi! Look.

764
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,019
Treasure

765
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,100
"Treasure?"

766
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,460
Sang Gi.

767
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:04,299
Our truck.

768
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,819
Get the truck!

769
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:11,379
- Darn it. - Hey!

770
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,860
Get the truck!

771
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,779
No!

772
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:26,060
Hey, no, stop.

773
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,060
Stay still.

774
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,819
Wait.

775
00:48:43,139 --> 00:48:45,500
No!

776
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:48,339
No!

777
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:56,259
No!

778
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,699
No.

779
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,540
No!

780
00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:15,380
My truck...

781
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,500
No!

782
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:24,060
No!

783
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:31,139
Let me borrow the tractor. At the place where the old man went.

784
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,940
Was there an ATM machine nearby?

785
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:36,659
I have a hunch.

786
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,699
I'll know for sure once I check something.

787
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,460
M2701

788
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,299
Mr. Kim?

789
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:29,339
Treasure

790
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:47,699
Our truck.

791
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,860
Get the truck!

792
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,178
No!

793
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:54,219
Get the truck!

794
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,420
No.

795
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:04,580
No.

796
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:06,860
No!

797
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,819
No!

798
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:13,259
After all I did...

799
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,940
No!

800
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,980
My truck.

801
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,020
Why are you crying?

802
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:28,499
Is something...

803
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,419
My truck...

804
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,739
Oh, dear.

805
00:51:33,259 --> 00:51:35,380
It's completely gone.

806
00:51:36,299 --> 00:51:38,460
It can't be fixed now.

807
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,020
What a pity.

808
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:45,500
My truck...

809
00:51:45,779 --> 00:51:48,698
This must be a nightmare.

810
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:50,259
Call Mr. Jang.

811
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,420
Say it's time for his final stroll.

812
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,460
Listen.

813
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,299
I know people like you very well.

814
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,659
I get you because...

815
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,980
we're the same kind.

816
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:35,139
The disgusting feeling...

817
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,699
of living in fear that someone will take what's yours.

818
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,259
I know that very well.

819
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:44,259
Now...

820
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,420
tell me everything and all will be well.

821
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,819
Shall we go after him?

822
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,580
No.

823
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,460
A senile old man can only get so far.

824
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:04,580
He'll lead us to his stash unless he has a death wish.

825
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:15,619
Sang Gi, isn't that a cliff?

826
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:18,219
Hey. Get him.

827
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,020
Sang Gi!

828
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,540
He's dead. We killed him.

829
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,179
Sang Gi, a man's dead!

830
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:10,779
You idiots.

831
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:13,139
Can't you see?

832
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,860
The money that old man buried.

833
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,619
The only people who know are...

834
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,940
you two...

835
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:26,339
and me.

836
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:28,500
It's only the three of us.

837
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:32,179
Come here.

838
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,699
Get over here. Hey.

839
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,179
Hey!

840
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:40,020
You idiots never learn!

841
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:43,178
This is why you can never leave...

842
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,659
the countryside.

843
00:54:54,259 --> 00:54:55,739
Mount Shinwoong

844
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,900
This money is mine now.

845
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,139
Come on.

846
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,060
Come on.

847
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:15,779
Marine Corps

848
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:21,259
Mr. Jang.

849
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:26,219
You're amazing. How did you think of jumping from there?

850
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,939
From next time, let young people do this.

851
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,019
Yes, sir.

852
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,139
Gyeong Gu. Help me.

853
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:34,699
Okay. Follow me.

854
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,698
Gyeong Gu. No.

855
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:38,778
Don't start the boat.

856
00:55:38,779 --> 00:55:40,500
Gyeong Gu!

857
00:55:40,659 --> 00:55:42,500
Hey. Hurry up.

858
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,339
- Taxi. - Hurry. Over here.

859
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,619
Let's go.

860
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,860
Just hurry up and drive.

861
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,940
I'm sorry.

862
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:15,699
Help!

863
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,539
I'm sorry. Please help me.

864
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,860
Wake up!

865
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:40,900
Path to treasure

866
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,940
Deluxe

867
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,500
Just leave him?

868
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:25,179
We shouldn't bother him when he's treasure hunting.

869
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:27,219
Until when?

870
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:29,659
When he finds the buried treasure,

871
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,139
it'll be over.

872
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,339
But there is no treasure.

873
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,980
Not for us, but for him, it exists.

874
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,420
He saw it, touched it...

875
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,219
and felt it.

876
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,179
It's an unforgettable day for him.

877
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,020
He lost all his fortune due to the fire.

878
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:01,860
His friends left.

879
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:04,540
On top of that, a man is dead.

880
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,500
It'll be a despairing situation, too much for him to handle.

881
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:18,980
Finding the money buried in the ground...

882
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:21,819
is the only way for him to escape reality.

883
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:39,299
The worse the situation is,

884
00:58:39,739 --> 00:58:41,819
the stronger the temptation and greed...

885
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,259
for treasure will get.

886
00:58:45,819 --> 00:58:47,739
Why did you call it introspection?

887
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:51,539
He should experience...

888
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,540
the twisted mindset that damaged only the kindest people...

889
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,699
himself.

890
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:00,060
It's like a prison.

891
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,500
Prison created by his own greed.

892
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,500
When will he be out of that prison?

893
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,380
When he realizes it, he'll open the door and leave on his own.

894
00:59:09,739 --> 00:59:11,819
But that won't be easy.

895
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:15,060
There's no treasure, but there is a dud.

896
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,299
- A dud? - What?

897
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,259
There were already multiple red flags in that area.

898
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:33,420
In the army, red flags mean...

899
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:36,299
the mine area.

900
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,139
My goodness.

901
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,420
Deluxe

902
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,698
- Thank you. - Take care.

903
01:00:08,699 --> 01:00:09,699
Have a good day.

904
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,659
You can give me the garbage.

905
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:15,259
- Does it work now? - It works very well.

906
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:16,460
Thank you.

907
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,940
- Here you are. - Thank you.

908
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,658
It's soap.

909
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,819
Nongju

910
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,459
We retrieved the money you lost...

911
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,299
as well as everyone else's.

912
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,619
You don't need to worry anymore.

913
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:35,460
I don't know how to thank you.

914
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,379
We wouldn't ask for more...

915
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,699
than your long and healthy life.

916
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,819
Grandma!

917
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,500
Mother. It's us.

918
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,979
Grandma.

919
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,698
- Oh, dear. - Hello.

920
01:00:49,699 --> 01:00:51,818
You didn't have to come all the way.

921
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:53,380
We don't get to visit you often.

922
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,859
- Are you well now? - Yes.

923
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,299
Are you well?

924
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:00,819
Let's go.

925
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,500
I made you good food. Let's go.

926
01:01:08,259 --> 01:01:10,100
I'll take the taxi out of service.

927
01:01:11,179 --> 01:01:12,659

Well done, everyone.

930
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,420
Let's see.

932
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,698
Keep going.

933
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:52,540
Keep going.

934
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,619
- It sounds weird. - What?

935
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,179
It sounds weird?

936
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,060
Go Eun.

937
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,020
Do you have the data from last year?

938
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:12,980
Hi.

939
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,658
I found him.

940
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,819
Resume

941
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,100
Have a good day.

942
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:36,940
Taxi Driver 2

943
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:01,698
We will never forget.

944
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:04,818
You were once me,

945
01:04:04,819 --> 01:04:06,939
and I will soon walk the same path.

946
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:09,178
Find me my So Mang.

947
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,499
If we call the police, they'll contact her parents.

948
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,459
Back to her parents who don't even know who she is?

949
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,499
Not a chance.

950
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,338
- Please don't tell uncle. - Uncle?

951
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:20,579
Mr. Kang's real name is Kang Pil Seung.

952
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,459
Maybe that's why his company is named Pil Consulting.

953
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,059
You don't know Mr. Kang?

954
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,778
He's the best real estate consultant.

955
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,138
You can't go in without a ticket.

956
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:30,139
He doesn't consult anyone.

957
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,059
But is there really no way?

958
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,818
We're here to buy a house.

959
01:04:33,819 --> 01:04:35,259
To live together.

960
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:37,818
You must not lie.

961
01:04:37,819 --> 01:04:38,819
A child is gone?

962
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,338
That little kid is so fast.

963
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:42,059
- What do we do? - Go Eun.

964
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,500
Will you marry me?

965
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,179
What?
