Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,700
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,340
Take about seven customers today.

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,740
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,179
- Is he here? - Yes, he's waiting inside.

11
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,539
Hello.

12
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,699
Hello, Mr. On.

13
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,780
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

14
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,059
Don't be, I didn't mind at all. I had a nice tea break.

15
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:04,539
The view here is fantastic.

16
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,380
- And our contract? - Yes.

17
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,738
As soon as the city council clears the reconstruction,

18
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,379
we can get started on the interior.

19
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,259
It'll take about four weeks until we're ready to reopen.

20
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,019
Sounds good.

21
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,259
I'm handing over management rights because I trust you, Mr. On.

22
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:30,910
Since when did you ever trust me?

23
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,738
We overbid, didn't we?

24
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:37,100
All that's left for us to do is make lots of money.

25
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,538
- It's all... - I sent the down-payment.

26
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,630
Okay.

27
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,470
It just came in.

28
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:51,139
Mr. On, you slipped up just then.

29
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:54,299
I did?

30
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:57,259
You should've wired the money after I stamped my seal.

31
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,219
What if you'd wired the money and I refused to do that?

32
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,380
You'd have ended up losing a massive amount of money.

33
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Right.

35
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,859
That's the contract taken care of.

36
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,978
How about we meet up one day to...

37
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:21,340
Hang on, what's wrong?

38
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,660
I went over the contract thoroughly,

39
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,578
and I make the biggest profit when the contract...

40
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,259
is defaulted due to...

41
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,340
the other party's personal reasons.

42
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,699
Hey, you.

43
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,620
Mr. On, you...

44
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,780
With you out of the way,

45
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:52,620
I become the hotel's priority creditor.

46
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,978
You...

47
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:56,340
You slipped up.

48
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,780
That's why this is happening to you.

49
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,579
Weren't we friends? We were, right?

50
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,180
"Friends?"

51
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,859
You're not even on my level.

52
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,060
I'll run the place well,

53
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,979
now that it's mine.

halfway up Mount Yangmun.

68
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,179
It was Mr. Kang.

First, it was Cotaya, and now this.

72
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,340
I think they're trying to cover something up.

73
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:52,499
I think it's the opposite.

74
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:54,580
"The opposite?"

75
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,220
Kang Pil Seung was a homeless subway station vagrant.

76
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,660
Someone took him halfway up Mount Yangmun and staged a suicide.

77
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,299
This isn't a cover-up. It's a display.

78
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,299
This person enjoys amusement.

79
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:11,859
Someone who enjoys amusement...

80
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,939
Then...

81
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,460
They might already know about us.

82
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:19,539
They could already be watching us.

83
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:23,700
They might be much closer than we think.

- Get over here. - What is it?

87
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,100
Come and see for yourself.

88
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,418
Can't you just tell me?

89
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,020
I'm a bit busy.

90
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:42,660
- Get in. - What?

91
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,979
Get in already.

92
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,979
My gosh.

93
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,418
Fasten your seat belt.

94
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:52,738
Can't you just tell me? I really am busy.

95
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:54,979
I can't tell until you fasten your seat belt.

96
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,419
This had better be something.

97
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,140
- Are you done? - Yes.

98
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,340
Then...

99
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:06,419
How's that?

100
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,178
It's usually a seat belt,

101
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,899
but in case of an emergency, it turns into...

102
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,899
a restraining belt that keeps bad guys tied down.

103
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,059
You can't undo it.

104
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,220
The passenger seat flips back too as soon as the button's pressed.

105
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,499
How's that? Isn't it awesome?

106
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,900
It's just fantastic.

107
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,379
What do you think, Go Eun?

108
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:27,220
Get me out while I'm asking nicely.

109
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:28,938
- I need to pee. - What?

110
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,499
Deluxe

111
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,819
It's just that I wanted your approval for...

112
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,419
I said get me out of this.

113
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,298
Will you hit me if I do?

114
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:43,340
Five, four, one, zero.

115
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,220
Wait for me! This is why I said we shouldn't do it!

116
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:51,260
Mr. Park. Where are you going in such a hurry?

117
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,619
I have something to tell you. Mr. Park!

118
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,419
Mr. On, you're back early.

119
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,140
I'm going right back out again.

120
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,020
Do Gi, I had seven customers today.

121
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,460
What are they up to now?

122
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:10,460
I'll ask nicely. Open the door.

123
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,099
You're only speaking nicely. I'm not stupid.

124
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,299
Jin Eon did all the work.

125
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,459
You can't say that. That hurt!

126
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,259
It shouldn't. You made it.

127
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,659
- I just did what you said. - What's going on?

128
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,259
- It was your idea. - Don't you mind.

129
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,340
Go Eun!

130
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,058
I have lots of experience.

131
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:29,259
- I'll break this door. - Don't!

132
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,058
- You'll ruin the car! - You'll hurt yourself.

133
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,099
- You don't know what to do! - I'm coming for you.

134
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,418
- Don't do that. - Open the door!

135
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,618
- No. - I'll break in...

136
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,059
and break everything up!

137
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,899
- You'll ruin the car! - Get out.

138
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,579
- Don't do that! - Stop this.

139
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,659
Don't!

140
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,059
- Why... - You'll ruin the car!

141
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,549
Open the door, then!

142
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,550
- No! - It worked.

143
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
I'll show you I can break in.

144
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:59,940
Get out of the way. I'll just take my sister!

145
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,100
Everything is their choice.

146
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,779
We do not detain anyone.

147
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,739
I beg you.

148
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,580
Let my sister go.

149
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,459
Just let me take my sister!

150
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,499
Take her.

151
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,940
Stop

152
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:21,190
What are you anyway?

153
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,939
Stop

154
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,779
She is...

155
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,779
my only remaining family.

156
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:34,379
She's my sister!

157
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,310
"Family?"

158
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,340
You're calling yourself her family, but you're stalking her.

159
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,060
By talking down your sister's religion.

160
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,430

161
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,899
Help me. My sister's in there.

162
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,859
They won't let her go!

163
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,310
You can't do this out here. We got a complaint.

164
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,858
Don't just stand there.

165
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:08,060
Take her off my private property.

166
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,619
- Come with us. - No, I can't.

167
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,700
No! My sister's in there!

168
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,550
No!

169
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:19,619
Lee Jin Sun! Come outside! Let's go!

170
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,018
Let go.

171
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,219
Get her in the car.

172
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,499
I'm not leaving until my sister's free.

173
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,019

174
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,779

Jin Sun! Get out here!

177
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,658
This could become obstruction.

178
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:39,549
Will you stop it?

179
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,619
Let's go already.

what happened to you?

184
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,019

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,379
Please help my sister.

187
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:17,420
Deluxe

188
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:29,059
Let's see.

189
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,460
Admission Announcement

190
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:33,540
What if I didn't get in?

191
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,658
Don't say that.

192
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,378
You're a smart girl.

193
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,379
Let's take a look.

194
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,220
Even so. What if I failed?

195
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,420
If you failed? Then...

196
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,658
Jin Sun! No...

197
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:48,700
You got in!

198
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,858
You got in!

199
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:52,138
Congratulations from Seongui University.

Lee Jin Hee, Business Management

201
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,060
Yes!

202
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,100
Good for you. Well done.

203
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:09,459
Don't just study at university.

204
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,858
Make lots of friends too.

205
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,978
No. I'll just study.

206
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:14,060
What?

207
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,379
Don't worry about tuition.

208
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:20,138
- Get yourself a boyfriend too. - No, thanks.

209
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,658
"No, thanks?" You'll find one right away!

210
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:23,700
How'd you know?

211
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,739
Good for you. I'm so proud.

212
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,540
Well done.

213
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,979
Nothing's more important than study.

214
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,659
My sister...

215
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,540
was an older sister,

216
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,979
a mom, and a dad to me.

217
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,940
- Are you ready? - Yes.

218
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,819
One, two...

219
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,540
Oh, dear. Miss?

220
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:55,220
What's wrong? Gosh, Jin Sun.

221
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,859
Do you not feel well?

222
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,219
I must be a bit tired.

223
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,739
It's acute myeloid leukaemia.

224
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,700
We need to run more tests to be sure,

225
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,859
but it seems pretty advanced.

226
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,499
We realized too late...

227
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,779
that my sister's illness was a terrible one.

228
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Jin Sun.

229
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,180
Are you allowed to leave work like this?

230
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,898
I took a half day.

231
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,739
Are you done with today's treatment?

232
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
When's the next appointment?

233
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:34,979
Well...

234
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:39,460
I'm thinking of quitting the treatment.

235
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:42,378
It's a waste of money.

236
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:44,259
I don't think I'm getting better.

237
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,779
You don't have to worry about money.

238
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,779
We still have a lot of the money Mom and Dad left us.

239
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,340
As if we do.

240
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,018
Oh, did I not tell you?

241
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:58,300
I got a nice raise this year.

242
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,540
Guess what?

243
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,579
Two years ago today, you started your treatment.

244
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,738
I think we fought well and hard for two years.

245
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:12,619
So don't you get any bad thoughts.

246
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,180
Wait here while I get the prescription.

00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:25,180
Payments

248
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,339
Father put his hand on me and said...

249
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,018
I don't know exactly when,

250
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,139
but my sister started to act weird.

251
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,300
"How did you get better? How were you healed?"

252
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:57,220
They tried to...

253
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,580
give me a shot and put the evil back into me.

254
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,220
What are you watching?

255
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,300
Jin Sun.

256
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,180
Yes? What?

257
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,379
Are you done using the bathroom?

258
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,139
She began to keep more and more secrets.

A loan?

262
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,339
You can't go through someone else's mail.

263
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,378
Jin Sun. What happened to your face?

264
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,460
It's nothing.

265
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,700
I fell.

Lee Jin Sun's Testimony

268
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,420
For the past two years,

269
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,738
I endured a dreadful weekly treatment...

270
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,898
and took a handful of pills each day.

271
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,750
But my health still went downhill.

272
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:13,580
But after Father touched me once, I felt a miraculous healing.

273
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:18,419
What are you doing?

274
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,510
Jin Sun. You're not in your right mind.

275
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,618
You can't stop your treatments!

276
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,059
What do you know about it?

277
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,178
Did you give these people all the money for your treatments?

278
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,458
They can treat me, not the hospital.

279
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,580
Is that why you took out a loan too?

280
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,020
To give it to some strange people?

281
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:38,990
We don't see eye to eye.

282
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,270
It's just as he said.

283
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,658
Father's word heals.

284
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:49,218
Father's word heals.

285
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,300
Father's word heals.

286
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,458
Father's word heals.

287
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:56,780
Father's word heals.

288
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,899
Father's word heals.

289
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,579
Sporadic treatments won't do any good.

290
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,458
Considering her condition,

291
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,138
if she doesn't resume treatment soon,

292
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,750
things could get much worse.

293
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,619
Talk to her and get her to come back.

294
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:17,859
Jin Sun.

295
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,059
To my dear sister Jin Hee

296
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,510
Jin Hee, I was in such a bad way, and there was no getting better.

297
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,060
Until I met him.

298
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,580
Whatever the doctor says, don't believe her.

299
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,379
I feel like I saw a light at the end of a long tunnel.

300
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,100
You'll understand in time...

301
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,619
just how powerful Sunbaek is.

302
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,060
If I'm with him, I will slowly get better.

303
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,379
Wait for me until then.

304
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:10,699
Jin Sun.

305
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,219
Jin Sun!

306
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,618
That's my sister.

307
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:18,990
Non-believers can't enter.

308
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,178
My sister needs a doctor.

309
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,060
Ms. Lee is healing in body and mind.

310
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,820
Jin Sun!

311
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:30,340
- Let me in! - Sir.

312
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:36,419
Are you Lee Jin Hee?

313
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,510
Yes, I'm Lee Jin Hee.

314
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,300
Ms. Lee says she doesn't want to see you, and that you should leave.

315
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,749
There's no way she'd say that.

316
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,539
Why wouldn't she want to see me?

317
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,459
We passed you her message.

318
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,218
No, wait.

319
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:53,300
Let me talk to my sister! It won't take long!

320
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,418
We can't intervene with any religion.

321
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:57,510
We shouldn't.

322
00:19:57,939 --> 00:20:00,269
What religion kidnaps people...

323
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,859
and keeps them away from family?

324
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,379
Please help me.

325
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,378
I have to get my sister out.

326
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:11,269
If she said she doesn't want to see you, there's nothing we can do.

327
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,899
You should meet and persuade her yourself.

328
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:17,939
How? Those people won't let me see her!

329
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:19,699
Sorry.

330
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,300
No one will help.

331
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,300
I just don't know what to do.

332
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:53,060
Do you want a coffee?

333
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,580
How did you know I'd be here?

334
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,139
I thought you'd be with your sister.

335
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:13,060
I think I'm fine,

336
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:15,820
but then I find myself wondering.

337
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,659
"Maybe my sister will come home."

338
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,579
I think about her opening my room door in the morning...

339
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,300
telling me off for sleeping in again...

340
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,340
and announcing that breakfast is ready.

341
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:34,659
I wish her to be back as if nothing had happened.

342
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,179
That's silly of me, right?

343
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:44,139
If you're silly,

344
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:47,820
Mr. Jang, Mr. Choi, Mr. Park, and I...

345
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,270
will also be silly.

346
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:00,580
I want us to help the client get her sister back.

347
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:02,740
I mean it.

348
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,139
I'll head to the facility tomorrow.

349
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,658
What did you do with my daughter?

350
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,779
- I know she's here. - Get out here!

351
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,938
- You! - Darn you!

352
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,938
- You darn rats! - What did you do with her?

353
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:26,580
- Come out here! - Darn you all.

354
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:30,219
- Get out here! - Let my daughter go!

355
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,699
- Honey! - Where's my daughter?

356
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,138
- I know she's in here. - Where is she?

357
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:36,820
Honey!

358
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,540
- Get him. - Look who it is!

359
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,339
- Don't you move! - Hey!

360
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,659
Did you call the police?

361
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,300
It's not like anyone entered the property.

362
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,539
A liberal nation deserves more...

363
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,780
than those vulgar beings.

364
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,060
- Let's go. - Get out here!

365
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,378
- You! - Don't go!

366
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:56,059
- Get back here. - Where's my daughter?

367
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,260
- My daughter! - Where do you think you're going?

368
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,580
- Come back here! - Where's my daughter?

369
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:05,980
Honey, please get out here.

370
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:09,659
Disconnected

371
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,780
Deluxe

372
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:21,659
Deluxe

373
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:23,780
Security is tight.

374
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,020
The windows have been blocked, and I can't see anything.

375
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,580
Just a second. We'll soon have eyes.

376
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,859
Are you still not done?

377
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:37,179
What's taking you so long when this is pretty straightforward?

378
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,979
You get up here, then.

379
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,300
Your mind will go blank.

380
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:43,419
Hold on. Why am I up here?

381
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,379
All right. Check your bag.

382
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,780
- Something's in there. - My bag?

383
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:52,698
- I found it. - Good job.

384
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:56,539
Connect that to the middle socket.

385
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,020
Right. That's what I came up here to do.

386
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,580
Gosh.

387
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:09,459
Good. Mr. Kim, you now have eyes.

388
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,020
Connecting

389
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,459
Hear me!

390
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,820
The end is near.

391
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,659
What they call a vaccine?

392
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,898
When you go to a hospital with an illness,

393
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:38,099
they give you shots and make you take medicine.

394
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,020
By doing so, they're creating evil spirits.

395
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:43,259
They are creating what is utterly horrendous.

396
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,580
- Father! - Father!

397
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:47,378
- Father. - Father.

398
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:49,059
Who are you to each other?

399
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,499
- Father. - Father.

400
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
I am her mother.

401
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,740
I am her daughter.

402
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,339
No, you're not!

403
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,580
Father!

404
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,898
You must sever ties with those closest to you.

405
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:04,819
How many times have I said that?

406
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,658
That is how you purify yourself...

407
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:10,059
and get a seat on the train to Sunbaek Hill.

408
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,418
I told you that numerous times!

409
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:12,859
- Father. - Father.

410
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:14,419
Do you wish to remain as an evil spirit?

411
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,418
- I am sorry. - I am sorry!

412
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:20,379
- Father, I am sorry. - Father, I am sorry.

413
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,419
- Please... - I am sorry.

414
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:27,218
- Does it hurt? - No.

415
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:30,219
- Are you in pain? - I'm not.

416
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,300
Remember this pain.

417
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:35,019
And whenever you're in pain,

418
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,259
you will remember this moment...

419
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,619
while longing for the land of purity.

420
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,739
Be enlightened!

421
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,980
- Father! - Father!

422
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,500
Help one another.

423
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,419
Sever your earthly ties.

424
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,500
I must be the only being that connects you to each other.

425
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,340
- I am your one and only father! - Father!

426
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:10,780
Help her too.

427
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,540
Again.

428
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,419
When death was near,

429
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:29,619
the Deity spoke to me.

430
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,299
- "You, Ok Ju Man." - Father!

431
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,618
- "Be the light..." - Father!

432
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:36,938
"and save those from the inferno..."

433
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:39,300
"that live in torment."

434
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:43,139
That is why I will never give up.

435
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:46,378
- Father! - I will not leave anyone behind...

436
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:49,059
when I make my way to Sunbaek Hill.

437
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,499
- Father. - Father.

438
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,379
- I will not leave you. - Father!

439
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:56,059
And I will not give up on you!

440
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,059
- Father. - Father.

441
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,698
- Father. - Father!

442
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:01,339
Let us go!

443
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,419
- Father! - Father!

444
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,178
Catholic churches have priests, churches have pastors,

445
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:16,899
and Sunbaek Church has Father.

446
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,219
What's the deal with the crybaby?

447
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:22,459
Father Ok "Crybaby" Ju Man...

448
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,300
was in the fabric business for quite a while.

449
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,980
After tanking his business in China,

450
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:31,500
he came to Korea and started a new one.

451
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,100
There's nothing abnormal about it.

452
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:36,459
Right? It's pretty run-of-the-mill.

453
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:40,300
But underneath what seems like an average man...

454
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,138
is a man with 14 convictions.

455
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:43,739
Pyramid scheme, embezzlement,

456
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,779
spreading false rumours, fraud, and more.

457
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780
How does one commit all those crimes while running a fabric business?

458
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:51,020
And...

459
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,980
Ta-Da.

460
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,859
No way.

461
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,580
What on earth is that? A space station?

462
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:03,059
It's the image of Sunbaek Chapel,

463
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,740
the project he's been passionately pursuing.

464
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:08,739
You can tell that it'll cost a lot of money.

465
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,179
He wishes to be King in his own castle.

466
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,739
Anyone can tell it's a cult,

467
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,060
so why did Jin Sun join it and cut ties with her sister?

468
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:17,500
I don't get it.

469
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,579
No one believes...

470
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,179
that they're a member of a cult.

471
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:24,500
Taking advantage of their belief...

472
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:27,659
to fulfill one's selfish desire is the real crime here.

473
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:30,819
What's worse though...

474
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,780
is that it's almost impossible...

475
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,060
to get the devotees to see that they're victims of a crime.

476
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,619
Their belief is that strong.

477
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,859
Death, evil spirits, and inferno.

478
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,979
He terrorizes them with threats.

479
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,500
That's how he controls them.

480
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,699
The weaker the body and mind,

481
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,300
the more susceptible and dependent they get.

482
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:53,580
To maximize that fear,

483
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,859
he makes them sever contact with their families.

484
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,059
Jin Sun only has a sister left, but she's not allowed to see her.

485
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,819
You lose the right to be called a religion...

486
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,580
the second you force people to ostracise their families.

487
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,500
They're a pseudo religious criminal organization.

488
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,100
What should we do with that wicked father?

489
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:21,500
Mr. Park.

490
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,020
Punch me five times.

491
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:30,899
- What? - Actually, it can be ten times.

492
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:33,340
I won't.

493
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,499
Gyeong Gu, go ahead. You always wanted to punch him.

494
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,539
When did I ever say that? I said no such thing.

495
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,020
- You... - Gyeong Gu.

496
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:50,459
What the...

497
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,299
Wake up.

498
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,499
Jang Seong Cheol

499
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,619
Kim Do Gi

500
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:02,300
And the real estate?

501
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,179
They've all been liquidated.

502
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,780
Park Hyun Jo, Geumsa Society executive

503
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,379
Did you confirm the bank account that the money was wired to?

504
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,419
- No. - No?

505
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,099
It was wired through institutions in China...

506
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,500
and then donated.

507
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:19,899
Is the money being managed through a non-profit corporation?

508
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,300
No, it's as I just said.

509
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,740
The money was donated.

510
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,780
The manager in charge of our real estate fund...

511
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:31,659
was also taken out by them.

512
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,340
This is partially your fault.

513
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
If you hadn't dawdled,

514
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,740
this wouldn't have happened.

515
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,340
What exactly are you doing over there?

516
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:44,699
Playing house?

517
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,580
Are you kidding me?

518
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:50,780
It seems to me that you have tunnel-vision.

519
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,780
What?

520
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,939
Hyun Jo,

521
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,899
do you understand our situation?

522
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:00,740
What situation?

523
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:02,500
Our pathetic situation...

524
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,419
where we lost all our money?

525
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,858
Please stop being a moron...

526
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:08,419
and see what's going on.

527
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,300
Don't be bothered by chump change.

528
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,699
The operation I had set up in Cotaya was perfect.

529
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,259
I even had a police captain on our payroll just in case...

530
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,060
to keep our back door secure.

531
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:33,899
It couldn't be easily infiltrated.

532
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,820
But they managed to do it.

533
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:47,139
Where is this young man?

534
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,659
But some random taxi driver...

535
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,980
infiltrated my organization through its weakest point...

536
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:18,459
and uprooted it.

537
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:21,500
Funny, right?

538
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,219
But that wasn't the only time.

539
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:52,579
He approached our man while in search of a house,

540
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,819
brought down our orphanage, and took all our real estate.

541
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,899
He even freed all the children.

542
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,458
Can you understand all that?

543
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:04,179
Because I can't.

544
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,859
A geezer who runs a taxi company,

545
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,418
two useless auto mechanics who used to be lab rats,

546
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:21,458
a former police officer who's now a bookkeeper,

547
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:25,099
and a taxi driver who used to serve in the military.

548
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,580
Rainbow Transport

549
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,458
Two of our operations were brought down...

550
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:32,459
by these worthless punks.

551
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,060
Aren't you curious?

552
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,859
Don't you want to know why they're doing this?

553
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,379
There has to be a reason.

554
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,019
Rainbow Transport

555
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,540
Taxi Driver

556
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:03,340
Taxi Driver

557
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,779
Harmless videos create a better atmosphere.

558
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,898
Children of the past feared tiger attacks, smallpox,

559
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:13,779
and war.

560
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,338
However, children of the present...

561
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:18,428
are at risk of watching harmful videos...

562
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:21,980
that turn them into delinquents.

563
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,298
Hello,

564
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:28,428
thank you for choosing our Rainbow Deluxe Taxi.

565
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,868
For your safety and convenience,

566
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,388
I'll explain a few rules.

567
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,059
While the deal is in place,

568
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,059
the cab's meter will keep on running.

569
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,698
The fees will be dealt with...

570
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,258
once the whole deal is done.

571
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:45,338
There may be some extra charges depending on the deal,

572
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:49,428
and once you use our service,

573
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:52,658
you must not breach our work to anyone.

574
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,909
Thank you for complying with the rules.

575
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:57,868
Now, if you'd like to get revenge on those who made you suffer,

576
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:00,178
press the blue button on the left.

577
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:01,738
If you don't want to get revenge,

578
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:05,259
press the red button on the right.

579
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,339
Please make your choice.

580
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,339
You have made your choice.

581
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,699
Deluxe

582
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:42,909
We Buy Gold at the Lowest Price

583
00:35:43,259 --> 00:35:44,259
It's perfect.

584
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,339
Now, no one will approach the van.

585
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,659
Let's get on the road.

586
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,020
Off we go.

587
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,460
We Buy Gold at the Lowest Price

588
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,179
5283 beginning service.

589
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,619
Deluxe

590
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,258
Don't worry, Mr. Park.

591
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:27,699
You can do a good job.

592
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,499
Repeat after me. "I can do it."

593
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,218
Stop it, will you? As if you know how I feel right now.

594
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:35,739
Of course, I know how you feel.

595
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,940
Here you go. Eat one and focus.

596
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:53,779
Let's focus.

597
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:00,389
We Buy Gold at the Lowest Price

598
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,389
Why am I always chosen for these kinds of roles?

599
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:07,139
Because sincerity is written all over your face.

600
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:09,429
Sincerity?

601
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,459
Everything you do seems believable.

602
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,499
Mr. Park, do you have makeup on?

603
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,138
You really look sick.

604
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,388
Good job on that.

605
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:19,658
What are you talking about? I don't have any makeup on.

606
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:22,060
See? That's what I meant by your sincerity.

607
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,540
But I'm terrified.

608
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,389
Someone's approaching you.

609
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:30,699
I'm doomed.

610
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:37,909
Thank you.

611
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:45,259
Good luck.

612
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:46,580
Sunbaek Church

613
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,500
What did your doctor say?

614
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,339
My doctor said I had no hope.

615
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:01,580
My doctors also said that I didn't have any hope,

616
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,460
but I'm now free of my illness.

617
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,619
You were fully cured?

618
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,699
How?

619
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:11,940
After being diagnosed with cancer,

620
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:15,179
I spent two years receiving treatments and surgeries.

621
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:17,259
But what I heard...

622
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:19,908
after spending tens of thousands of dollars...

623
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:21,909
was that I couldn't be cured.

624
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,139
When I was in despair after losing everything,

625
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:29,179
I met Father Ok Ju Man.

626
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,460
Then, Father spoke.

627
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:32,909
"Be healed."

628
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,908
"Be healed."

629
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:37,388
"Be healed!"

630
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:38,818
Father!

631
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:43,059
At that moment, I felt my body being miraculously cured.

632
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,060
Father!

633
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:45,429
I wasn't saved...

634
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,940
by a doctor or medicine.

635
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,778
It was Father Ok Ju Man who saved me!

636
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:54,138
- Father. - Father.

637
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:55,460
Father.

638
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,020
- Father! - Father.

639
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:02,869
- Father. - Father...

640
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,389
Be healed...

641
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,219
and follow me to the land of eternal life.

642
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:15,299
I will prepare the train that will take us to Sunbaek Hill.

643
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:18,539
Let us be one.

644
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,618
- Father. - Father.

645
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:23,259
- Father! - Father.

646
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:25,659
- Father! - Father!

647
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:30,389
I know you still suffer from your illness,

648
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:33,618
but you must not see a doctor.

649
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:38,019
Evil spirits within you are fighting your pure energy.

650
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,100
That is the reason you are sick.

651
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:42,818
Rejoice over your pain...

652
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:46,619
and let the pain purify you.

653
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:47,779
Father.

654
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:53,979
I sense that one of you is still lacking faith.

655
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,980
Distrust in the smallest amount?

656
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:59,139
Do you know what that is?

657
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:09,940
This is distrust in the smallest amount.

658
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,259
Let me now display the Power of Sunbaek.

659
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,539
- What the... - What more should I show you...

660
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,699
to make you believe me?

661
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:38,389
What more should I do?

662
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:01,339
Excuse me.

663
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,819
Are you all right? You seem ill.

664
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,940
I'm fine.

665
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:11,500
I've been getting better.

666
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,778
I see.

667
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:15,219
The pain I'm feeling...

668
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,389
is me battling the evil spirits within me.

669
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,699
Your sister has been asking for you.

670
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:25,389
Do you know what I dream of?

671
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,940
To hop on the train to Sunbaek Hill...

672
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,659
along with my sister.

673
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:34,908
Your illness can't be cured here.

674
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,059
You must receive treatment outside this facility.

675
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,659
Once my illness is cured,

676
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,940
my sister will believe in the Power of Sunbaek.

677
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,429
It's why...

678
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:48,259
I will...

679
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,299
I will be cured.

680
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,460
Yeongram Silk and Satin

681
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,980
Our Clothes, Yeongram Silk and Satin

682
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:30,659
Gosh.

683
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,909
We buy gold tooth crowns.

684
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:40,179
I tried to bring her out like Mr. Kim said, but she won't budge.

685
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,980
How could one have full faith in someone?

686
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:48,619
Porcelain Village

687
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,738
At this point, what's the point of bringing her out?

688
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,779
She'll go back in there with her own feet.

689
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:00,460
Yes, unless Ok Ju Man orders her to leave.

690
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:01,779
What?

691
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,429
The cult leader would kick his followers out on his own?

692
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,500
That's highly unlikely.

693
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:11,389
He'd never do that.

694
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,500
He worked so hard to gather them. He'd never tell them to leave.

695
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,179
Are you saying you'll make him?

696
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:19,179
No, I can't do it either.

697
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:21,060
There's not much I can do.

698
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:23,869
If you can't do it, who else?

699
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,779
The success of this request is...

700
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,139
solely up to Mr. Park and Mr. Choi.

701
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:35,139
Up to us?

702
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:37,259
Up to us.

703
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,380
Make everything in here possible. No matter what.

704
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:58,219
All this?

705
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,060
Yes, make all of it possible and send it to me.

706
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:05,339
Okay. Leave it to me.

707
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,900
Can we do all this?

708
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:09,739
Didn't you hear Mr. Kim?

709
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,980
The success is solely up to us.

710
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:16,500
Don't worry. This is as easy as pie.

711
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:19,219
Wait.

712
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,460
8pm

713
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:21,819
Oh, right.

714
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:25,099
Oh, gosh.

715
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,060
I'm scared to go there every time.

716
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:28,819
You can do it.

717
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:31,179
You're sincere.

718
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,500
But I can't keep calm.

719
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,020
Follow Father and let's go

720
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,580
Father.

721
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,819
- Father. - Father.

722
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,060
The Power of Sunbaek.

723
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:52,618
Father.

724
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:55,980
Father.

725
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:58,819
- Father. - Father.

726
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,299
There aren't many seats left on the train to Sunbaek Hill.

727
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:09,020
Leave all your filthy sins to me.

728
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:12,619
Let's all become pure white!

729
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:26,100
- The Power of Sunbaek. - I believe in the Power of Sunbaek.

730
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:42,659
They're offering like crazy.

731
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,739
The Power of Sunbaek.

732
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,900
I only believe in the Power of Sunbaek.

733
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:55,500
The Power of Sunbaek.

734
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,859
Father. I believe in the Power of Sunbaek.

735
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,178
Believe in the Power of Sunbaek.

736
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:06,100
Let's go to Sunbaek Hill together

737
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:12,580
Let's get on the train to Sunbaek Hill together

738
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:14,299
The Power of Sunbaek.

739
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,460
I only believe in the Power of Sunbaek.

740
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,500
Father.

741
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,100
It's time to train your belief.

742
00:46:58,339 --> 00:46:59,900
Memorize the doctrine.

743
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,099
Memorize it?

744
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,139
The more you memorize, the more you'll believe it...

745
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,420
and see the miracle.

746
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,380
10 Principles to Go to Sunbaek Hill

747
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,939
10 Principles to Go to Sunbaek Hill

748
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,020
"I will serve and follow my only father Ok Ju Man."

749
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:20,020
"My only family is Father Ok Ju Man."

750
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:23,178
I have to memorize all this?

751
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,380
If you memorize it enough...

752
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,860
to recite it anywhere at anytime, knock on the door.

753
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:31,460
Then I'll open the door for you.

754
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:36,219
Does that mean I can't get out until I memorize all this?

755
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:42,900
But...

756
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:50,259
Father.

757
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,698
We buy gold for the cheapest price.

758
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:58,779
We buy gold tooth crowns.

759
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,020
I thought something happened. What took you so long?

760
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:10,259
How do I look?

761
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,020
Mr. Kim is waiting. Let's go.

762
00:48:16,259 --> 00:48:17,819
- Gyeong Gu. - Yes?

763
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,940
- You know what? - What?

764
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:22,940
Sunbaek Hill.

765
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,060
It might be real.

766
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:28,779
Where were you?

767
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,659
In the room of faith.

768
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,420
This isn't good.

769
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,500
Let's rush to another room of faith.

770
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:35,900
Put your seatbelt on.

771
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:37,860
Put your seatbelt on. Let's get going.

772
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:48,219
- Do you like it? - Yes.

773
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,779
Ta-Da.

774
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:55,020
Are they for me?

775
00:48:56,219 --> 00:48:57,699
They're the price for your tears.

776
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,218
I'm giving them, so you'd work hard.

777
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:01,219
They're so pretty.

778
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,698
By the way, I noticed your recent followers...

779
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:06,138
are pretty old.

780
00:49:06,139 --> 00:49:09,059
Even if they're close to death,

781
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,779
all humans want to live for at least a minute longer.

782
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:15,899
If you were them, would you frequent the hospital...

783
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,419
and wait for your death?

784
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:21,219
Or hear that you can live longer.

785
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:22,900
What would you prefer?

786
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:25,019
What if they end up dying?

787
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,739
They were meant to die. What about it?

788
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:30,859
I'm innocent by law.

789
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,659
I guess you do have something to make people trust you.

790
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:42,339
What's wrong?

791
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,060
What's the matter?

792
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,020
People...

793
00:49:51,299 --> 00:49:54,219
don't believe in my words.

794
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,299
Faith...

795
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,699
comes from here.

796
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,179
What? You scared me.

797
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,900
So you better cry so much.

798
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,738
It's hard to make one trust,

799
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:13,980
but once you make one trust you, it's game over.

800
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:17,699
I bet you'll end up in purgatory.

801
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,338
Purgatory my foot. Do you believe in that stuff?

802
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:21,580
How immature.

803
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,940
Kim Do Gi

804
00:50:28,339 --> 00:50:29,339
What's this?

805
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:31,339
The gentleman over there sent it.

806
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,739
- The gentleman? - Who's he?

807
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,500
Seriously.

808
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:52,339
Oh, that looks delicious.

809
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,900
Are you telling me to pay for your meal?

810
00:50:57,299 --> 00:50:58,420
Are you kidding me?

811
00:50:58,779 --> 00:51:01,420
What on earth are you doing in an expensive restaurant?

812
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:08,819
It's a pretty cheap price for your life.

813
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:10,259
Where are your manners?

814
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,540
You must always watch your head.

815
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:17,699
The ground is in the sky.

816
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,219
You're meant to die young.

817
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,299
You prick! Get a hold of yourself!

818
00:51:48,779 --> 00:51:51,380
Please forgive me, Monk.

819
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:01,540
I will make sure to remove the bone this time...

820
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:03,819
Sure. Eat.

821
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,619
Enjoy.

822
00:52:05,779 --> 00:52:08,659
I will make sure...

823
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:10,460
that there is no bone...

824
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:14,299
My goodness.

825
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:17,060
Why did you come back? I thought you went to argue with them.

826
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,218
I was going to, but I couldn't.

827
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:21,900
They're total lunatics.

828
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,139
- Gosh. - I can tell.

829
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,940
Gosh.

830
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,860
Land

831
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,699
Land

832
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:42,619
What on earth! My goodness!

833
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:45,259
Ju Man.

834
00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:48,659
- Are you okay? - That scared me so much.

835
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:54,900
Land

836
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,739
- What's this? - Always watch your head.

837
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,540
The ground is in the sky.

838
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,219
You're meant to die young.

839
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,699
How unlucky!

840
00:53:14,179 --> 00:53:16,179
- Are you okay? - You drive.

841
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,580
Mr. Choi. You can eat now.

842
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:24,420
Right. He left.

843
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:29,139
I focused too much.

844
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,380
Enjoy.

845
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,138
I'm going to eat everything here.

846
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:33,460
Mr. Kim.

847
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:36,459
You know the white liquid Sunbaek Church calls...

848
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,580
the Power of Sunbaek or something and fed Mr. Park?

849
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,540
Yes.

850
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:43,980
Meperidine hydrochloride was detected in that liquid.

851
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,500
Meperidine hydrochloride.

852
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,500
That's opioid analgesic.

853
00:53:49,779 --> 00:53:52,060
It's often used to treat patients with severe cancer.

854
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:54,899
Isn't that disgusting?

855
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,499
He was feeding his followers analgesics...

856
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,940
and stopped them from going to the hospital.

857
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:01,060
That will only worsen their condition.

858
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:04,980
I think that was enough for my introduction.

859
00:54:05,259 --> 00:54:06,819
Let's stop the construction first.

860
00:54:07,819 --> 00:54:09,500
The two big men...

861
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,699
already planted a lot.

862
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,060
Hello.

863
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:29,419
So, a relic was found? Where?

864
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,979
I already sent all the workers home...

865
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,178
and stopped the construction.

866
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:34,139
Where is the relic?

867
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,939
It's still on site.

868
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,980
Is that it?

869
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,500
Come on.

870
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:47,659
A relic?

871
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:51,779
A relic.

872
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:00,380
A relic?

873
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,460
Now, there are no more relics.

874
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,019
There are no longer relics.

875
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,739
That's just soil and rocks.

876
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:19,138
I dare you to report the cultural asset again like last time.

877
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:21,698
Do you know how much time we lost because of that?

878
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:24,579
We didn't do that on purpose. We're supposed to report it...

879
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,940
- if we find any... - Darn you.

880
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,658
If you die,

881
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,818
your underwear and socks become relics.

882
00:55:31,819 --> 00:55:34,019
What's the point of that?

883
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,579
Sunbaek Church that will be built right here...

884
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,299
is worth hundreds, thousands, and a million times more.

885
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,460
Could you please think?

886
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:47,580
I dare you to call me again for the same reason.

887
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:49,940
I'd just...

888
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,500
How unlucky.

889
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,380
It's almost time to give a sermon.

890
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:10,619
Where are you doing your mission?

891
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:12,618
Mostly in the hospital ICU you told us...

892
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,218
and the cancer center.

893
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:16,218
Visit nursing homes from time to time.

894
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:17,219
Yes.

895
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,779
You have a very important role.

896
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,500
I don't know about everyone else,

897
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:25,060
but I treat you like my real son.

898
00:56:25,259 --> 00:56:29,299
You got the first class in the first car of the train.

899
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,500
First class.

900
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:33,860
Thank you, Father.

901
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,100
Deluxe

902
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,179
Where are you?

903
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:13,659
Let's go to Sunbaek Hill together

904
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:15,420
Sun...

905
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:18,819
What on earth am I singing?

906
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:22,100
Get a hold of yourself!

907
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,659
- You haven't had dinner yet, right? - No.

908
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,420
- Have some fried chicken. - Fried chicken?

909
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:31,818
You're the best.

910
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:33,900
- Did you get the sauce? - What?

911
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,060
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, what's wrong?

912
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,379
Oh, gosh. You scared me.

913
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,338
You scared me so much.

914
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:42,500
Why are you all surprised?

915
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:46,179
Oh, Gyeong Gu. Why would you turn the light on inside all of a sudden?

916
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,219
Because I couldn't see anything.

917
00:57:48,819 --> 00:57:49,900
What kind of fried chicken is it?

918
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,940
What is wrong with you?

919
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,139
What did I do?

920
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,739
Just starve to death.

921
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,178
Go Eun. He didn't do that on purpose.

922
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:02,420
I'm eating it alone.

923
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:03,900
Go Eun.

924
00:58:05,259 --> 00:58:06,299
My fried chicken...

925
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,899
This is all your fault.

926
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,739
You little... Fried chicken is not the point!

927
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:13,460
Of course, it is.

928
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:16,419
Still, keep it in mind.

929
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,860
This request is solely up to us.

930
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:20,259
Let's get back to work.

931
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:23,420
What a waste of fried chicken.

932
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:42,659
What?

933
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,900
Is there a folk village nearby?

934
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,060
That scared me.

935
00:58:48,819 --> 00:58:51,020
Wait. What's this?

936
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,980
Gosh.

937
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,900
What on earth is wrong with this?

938
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,779
Oh, no.

939
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:08,060
Why did the engine suddenly die?

940
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:10,179
Gosh.

941
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:13,779
Look at that. The phone is...

942
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:17,819
No reception in the 21st century? Those little pricks, seriously...

943
00:59:18,299 --> 00:59:19,500
Where on earth am I?

944
00:59:24,659 --> 00:59:25,659
What is that?

945
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:25,060
Hey. If you have a phone, let me borrow it.

946
01:00:25,179 --> 01:00:26,619
My car broke down.

947
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,259
You're still alive.

948
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,139
What?

949
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,900
Hang on. You're from...

950
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:49,699
Haven't you ever learned your manners?

951
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,380
How dare you!

952
01:00:56,739 --> 01:00:59,420
Get lost!

953
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,179
The wicked being ran away for now.

954
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:38,380
But it'll soon come back.

955
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:42,659
For your life.

956
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,940
You may make calls now.

957
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,580
What a crazy cult prick.

958
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,698
That is so lame.

959
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:08,659
You think you can make money like that?

960
01:02:13,819 --> 01:02:16,420
He's calling you a cult.

961
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,580
I think he lacks faith.

962
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,259
If he lacks faith,

963
01:02:25,299 --> 01:02:26,380
I shall make it full.

964
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,380
Taxi Driver 2

965
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,419
Your sister's going to come back.

966
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,940
Are you sure?

967
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,818
I have to prove the cult leader is...

968
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:13,819
just another man blinded by his selfish interest.

969
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:16,219
The being that is following you.

970
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:19,258
Is it wearing a gat?

971
01:03:19,259 --> 01:03:21,739
It would never give up...

972
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,258
until you die.

973
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,979
Conceal yourself immediately!

974
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,658
Please help me, Monk.

975
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:30,738
I think he's requesting exorcism.

976
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:33,259
Do you even know what that means?

977
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:35,739
Mr. Kim. Jin Sun collapsed.
