Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,979
could make you feel uncomfortable.

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,300
The late Kim Do Gi

13
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:23,149
This can't be.

14
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,619
How could Mr. Kim be dead?

15
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,099
How could you die?

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,300
How could this be?

17
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,220
I'll clean this up.

18
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:44,699
This Detective Jang who isn't on the police force...

19
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,418
requested material to be sent...

20
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,299
to someone who doesn't work at the prosecutors' office,

21
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,578
and now a taxi driver has it.

22
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,659
The trail ends there, so there's no way of knowing...

23
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,579
We'll know once we bait them to come up to the surface.

24
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,779
I told you.

25
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,859
I'd take care of them in their own way.

26
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,180
I know Kim Do Gi the best.

27
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,460
Do Gi.

28
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:31,859
Mr. Kim?

29
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
- Let go of me! - Wait.

30
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:36,899
- No, it's too dangerous. - But he's still alive!

31
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,818
I said it was too dangerous!

32
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,660
Go Eun, no!

33
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,780
- Let go of me. - Mr. Kim...

34
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,660
Reveal yourself.

35
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,699
I'm dying to see who the mastermind is.

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,900
I did as you said. So it's over now, right?

39
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,059
Mr. Hyun Jo,

40
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,660
you sound pissed off.

41
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:36,619
Was planting a bomb in his taxi beneath you?

42
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,710
You're the one playing in the mud,

43
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,299
but it's my hands that are getting dirty.

44
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:46,020
You burned a hut to the ground to catch a fly.

45
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,220
Did you have to go this far?

46
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,379
Park Hyun Jo

47
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:01,299
There's no need to sound like you weren't involved.

48
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,340
Anyway, you did well.

49
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:05,739
But while you're at it,

50
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:11,418
I'd like you to confirm every guest...

51
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,059
that comes to pay their respects.

52
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,579
Also, check their financial records.

53
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,580
What?

54
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,580
Are you kidding me?

55
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,418
Look here, Manager On...

56
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,419
If someone is behind this ragtag crew,

57
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,099
he or she will make a move...

58
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,859
now that the lieutenant is dead.

59
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,020
Besides, a funeral home is easily accessible.

60
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,900

75
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,859
May I ask which case these pertain to?

76
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:48,539
Why don't you read what it says here?

77
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,699
It says "classified," sir.

78
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,739
So why ask, you moron?

79
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,019
- Do you think you're above me? - I apologize.

80
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,019
Stop apologizing and run the background checks.

81
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,179
Got it, sir.

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,179
Manager On, you darn brat.

What time is it?

00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,900
- It's 9pm. - He should be here by now, then.

I'm sure he'll be here.

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,700

00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:38,820

Mr. Kim, are things okay on your end?

That's odd.

94
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:26,699
I'm getting a weird noise signal from the taxi.

95
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,899
A noise signal?

96
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,259
Do you hear me?

97
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,739

98
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,779

- Mr. Kim! - Go Eun, no!

108
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,429
Let go of me. He's still inside.

109
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,429
No, it's too dangerous. Don't go.

110
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,309
- Let go of me! - No!

111
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,258
- No! - You can't.

112
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,220
- I said it was too dangerous. - Let go.

113
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,499
Don't!

114
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,139
- Mr. Kim! - Mr. Kim!

115
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,340
Are you all right?

116
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,180
Mr. Kim?

117
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,379
Mr. Kim?

118
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,139
Are you all right?

119
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,100
Apart from some scratches, yes.

120
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:37,100
You seem pretty banged up.

121
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,700
Mr. Kim.

122
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:41,739
Mr. Kim...

123
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,899
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

124
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,540
There could be a secondary explosion,

125
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
so let's move out.

126
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,060
This way. Hurry.

127
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:52,259
- Let's head to the van. - Sure.

128
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,019
What happened? Talk to me!

129
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:02,739
I got it.

130
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,739
I'm relieved to hear that no one was hurt.

131
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,340
Are those chemical symbols?

132
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:53,859
Trinitrotoluene.

133
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,738
In short, it's TNT.

134
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:56,939
TNT: An industrial and military explosive

135
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,540
To hide where it came from,

136
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,580
the outer cover was peeled off before being attached.

137
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,858
This is the chemical formula for TNT...

138
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:03,940
which is simpler than you think.

139
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,138
It's made from nitric and sulphuric acid.

140
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,060
- This isn't a science field trip. - Okay.

141
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:11,300
This monster just blew up our taxi.

142
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,139
It isn't the time to brush up on your knowledge.

143
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:19,659
The fact that it was planted on our taxi...

144
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,700
indicates that someone knows about us.

145
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,220
They more than just know us. Clearly, they hate our guts.

146
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:30,979
Someone...

147
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,580
harbours...

148
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,739
resentment toward us?

149
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,700
Someone clearly hates our guts,

150
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,180
and we should know who that is.

151
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,060
We should see their face.

152
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
How?

153
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:53,499
I died, remember? There should be a funeral.

154
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,619
A funeral?

155
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:59,899
Focus on whoever makes a move following my death.

156
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,340
Mr. Kim...

157
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:12,779
This can't be.

158
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,700

159
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,420
My gosh.

160
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:45,300
He isn't actually dead,

161
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:47,979
so how are you crying your eyes out?

162
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,899
Doesn't that photo of him make you sad?

163
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,420
You have a point.

164
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,859
It's time we made our move.

165
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,499
I'm ready.

166
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,420
The more I get to know her, the more she scares me.

167
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,739
I should stay on her good side. Good gosh.

168
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:33,460
Let's see if there are guests...

169
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,180
we do not recognize.

170
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:49,739
Seriously?

171
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:52,659
I apologize.

172
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,300
Gosh.

173
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,060
- Thank you. - No problem.

174
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:16,700
What do you think you're doing?

175
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,859
Come on.

176
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,100
- Me? - Gosh, no.

177
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,340
Why did you go to the library...

178
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,858
when I told you to have fun? Why the library?

179
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,659
Why would you take that with you?

180
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,180
Who needs textbooks while out having fun?

181
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,138
Mr. Park, at your 12 o'clock...

182
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,340
are two people who aren't eating.

183
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:08,899
I'll clean this up.

184
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,138
I can't get a clear image of the license plate...

185
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,340
from the CCTV footage.

186
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:42,580
I'll be right over.

00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,990
16S 9734

189
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,218
Hold on.

190
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:03,419
It's like we're role-playing.

191
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:05,780
Mr. Kim, how is it to be in my seat?

192
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,270
I finally know how you must've felt...

193
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,179
while on our missions.

194
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,859
And what would I have felt?

195
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:17,859
Well...

196
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,459
I can't help but be deeply worried.

197
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,419
I'm glad you finally realized it.

198
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,990
Chunhae Funeral Hall

199
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:14,899
Have a good night.

200
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:18,699
Rainbow Funeral Service

201
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,459
Rainbow Funeral Service

202
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:29,939
Rainbow Funeral Service

203
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,139
Rainbow Funeral Service

204
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:16,899
Memorial House

205
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,219
May the deceased rest in peace.

206
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,619
The late Kim Do Gi

207
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,540
Got it.

208
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,939
You can wrap it up.

209
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,020
His ashes were taken to a charnel house.

210
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,019
Background checks were run on every person at the funeral hall,

211
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,340
but nothing stood out.

212
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,270
Are you satisfied now?

213
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,659
Something about this doesn't feel right.

214
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:15,780
Maybe I should kill off another one.

215
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,510
Do you have the time for that...

216
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:20,060
when the bishop will soon be here?

217
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:23,419
The bishop is coming back?

218
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,100
What? You didn't know about that?

219
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,750
Did the bishop only tell me?

220
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:32,270
Then you probably don't know about this, either.

221
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,100
The bishop gave me a message.

222
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:41,060
You are to stop playing silly games and focus on your real job.

223
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:52,179
If you're cracking a joke, you picked the worst time to do so.

224
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,939
Are you sure that's what the bishop said?

225
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:03,540
"Tell him to stop playing silly games..."

226
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,100
"and to focus on his real job."

227
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:10,980
Those were the bishop's words.

228
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:20,339
Everyone has arrived.

229
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,780
Show them in.

230
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:26,218
Right. The bishop called the executives for a meeting today.

231
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,740
I was supposed to tell you.

232
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:29,740
But it slipped my mind.

233
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,060
Blue Bird Foundation

234
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,859
Letter of Resignation

235
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,859
Hey, Mr. On.

236
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,939
What are you doing here this late?

237
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,500
Nothing.

238
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,419
You're not here to talk to me?

239
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,939
I did what I came here for.

240
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,340
Do you remember the time I caused an accident?

241
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,260
You didn't scold me but comforted me instead.

242
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,060
It was nice.

243
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,179
You were the first person who was genuinely nice to me...

244
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,459
in my entire life.

245
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,300
I hope you live a long life.

246
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,580
Don't work too much.

247
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,379
Your small act of kindness saved your life.

248
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:06,820
It was just a guy. But this place feels so empty without him.

249
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,659
I get it. How can anyone work now?

250
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,859
These games are fun to play, but it always ends on a bitter note.

251
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:22,300
That's the drawback of this.

252
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:39,419
I thought we would be able to become friends, Do Gi.

253
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:41,459
What a shame.

254
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:57,260
M5283

255
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,740
Deluxe

256
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:26,979
A dead man has come back to life!

257
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,459
A ghost is driving the taxi!

258
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,939
That's so not funny.

259
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,499
Hey, think about a ghost turning on the blinker...

260
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,819
and stepping on the brakes.

261
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,740
This will hit you right before bed. You won't be getting any sleep now.

262
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,459
Did you get the results?

263
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,938
I got the identities of the strangers...

264
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:44,100
at your funeral.

265
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,418
Guard Sun

266
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,819
What? They are all working for the same company.

267
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,740
And all of them work here.

268
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,458
Black Sun.

269
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,820
Black Sun. The famous club in Gangnam.

270
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:04,938
Why would people from the club want Mr. Kim dead?

271
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:07,579
Mr. Kim, I didn't peg you as the type.

272
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,100
Have you ever skipped out on a bill at the club?

273
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Come on.

274
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,698
Or we might have provoked them in some way.

275
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,059
People who work in the Gray area really hate it...

276
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,138
when other people encroach into their space or cross the boundary.

277
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:20,139
Right?

278
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,740
What?

279
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:27,418
I just pointed out something insightful, right?

280
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:28,540
Let me add to that.

281
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:31,379
Remember what you said, Kim?

282
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,418
You told us to pay attention to the ones who made a move...

283
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:34,419
after your death.

284
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,859
Letter of Resignation

285
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,100
A letter of resignation?

286
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,219
On Ha Jun

287
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:44,699
Mr. On quit?

288
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,939
The person who made the first move was close to us.

289
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,619
Maybe, he quit because he was devastated that...

290
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:55,060
Mr. Kim died out of the blue.

291
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:56,418
But he was suspicious in many ways...

292
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:58,500
to give him the benefit of the doubt.

293
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,820
Lost and Found

294
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,139
What are you doing in here?

295
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,619
It was odd that he accidentally found our secret entrance.

296
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,539
Bookkeepers

297
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,779
Employee Board

298
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,019
Kim Do Gi

299
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,139
Ahn Go Eun

300
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,939
Engineers

301
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:32,259
Look at the resume he submitted when he started working here.

302
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,099
I went to his previous workplace...

303
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,340
and his previous house, listed on his resume.

304
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,379
But no one knew a guy named On Ha Jun.

305
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,539
The number you have dialled is no longer in service.

306
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,579
His number is no longer in service too.

307
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,619
Wait. Are you saying that...

308
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,699
Mr. On tried to kill Mr. Kim?

309
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,139
You can never really know someone completely.

310
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,019
He approached us with an ulterior motive...

311
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,500
from the get-go.

312
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,459
I'm glad I didn't befriend him.

313
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,740
That jerk. We were so nice to him.

314
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,178
Gosh, I can't let this slide.

315
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,059
He's going to pay for this when we catch him.

316
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,339
You don't even know where he is.

317
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,139
All the information he gave us was fake.

318
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:29,060
Resume

319
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,419
All of our leads must be there.

320
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
All right.

321
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:09,540
Deluxe

322
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,659
Wait. Mr. Kim.

323
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,859
Gosh. Don't tell me you plan to go in there dressed like that.

324
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:25,980
What? Is this a bad outfit?

325
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,378
Be honest.

326
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:30,980
You've never been to a club, right?

327
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:34,299
Well, clubs aren't my thing.

328
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,618
I bet you were a bookworm.

329
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:37,740
Gosh. It's so obvious.

330
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,740
How could you think about going in there...

331
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:41,939
Okay.

332
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
We'll go since we rarely studied at school.

333
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,020
Right. Besides, he's supposed to be dead.

334
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,178
Let us handle it.

335
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:52,459
We just have to get in there for some recon, right?

336
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,099
Are you serious about going there?

337
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,139
What's that? I've never seen that before.

338
00:30:58,459 --> 00:30:59,580
That startled me.

339
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,580
How long has it been here? That's...

340
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,859
Did you put this doll here?

341
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,819
I thought it would be nice to have a buddy...

342
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,020
when you were alone in the van.

343
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,100
Gosh.

344
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:22,619
It's soft and feels nice.

345
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,259
Okay. Let's get it.

346
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,340
Let's get it.

347
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,619
Show me the cash, baby.

348
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,219
I don't think this is going to work.

349
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:02,019
Gosh. I turned 20 a long time ago.

350
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,340
- Okay. - Let's show it to him.

351
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,780
Resident Registration Card, Date of birth

352
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,619
I doubt that you know any agents from our club.

353
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:17,458
There's no way for you to get in this way.

354
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:18,618
The doors are right there.

355
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:21,378
If you go around the corner, you'll see a karaoke bar.

356
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:22,458
Have fun there.

357
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:24,178
- Hey. Listen. - Okay.

358
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,300
It's my turn.

359
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,579
Hey. What's up, man?

360
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,980
What's up, my bro?

361
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,939
You can drink a beer. I get it.

362
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:44,219
Stop being a nuisance...

363
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,139
and go hit the karaoke bar when I'm still being civil to you.

364
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:50,419
- We should go. - Gosh.

365
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:52,820
You know, I love fishcakes.

366
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,858
- Me too. They're cheap too. - Soju is our kind of liquor.

367
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:57,060
- Soju all the way. No clubs for us. - And ramyeon.

368
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:59,179
- Thank you. - Thanks, man.

369
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:01,419
- Yes! - Gosh. I'm good.

370
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,459
I knew this would happen when you two were overly confident.

371
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,659
The skills...

372
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:14,659
I must have spent too much time studying.

373
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,858
Don't you think it's better for the deceased Mr. Kim to go?

374
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:19,139
He already left.

375
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,540
When? Where?

376
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:22,779
I didn't see him at the entrance.

377
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,980
He said he'd take a different entrance.

378
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,378
He said he could get in thanks to the distraction you two created.

379
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:29,179
Hey.

380
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:33,500
Gosh, he's thanking us for that? How nice of him.

381
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,179
Let's get it.

382
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,659
Let's get it.

383
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,699
Come on. Stay still.

384
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:02,780
Don't move, you jerk.

385
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
Over there.

386
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,580
Darn it.

387
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,060
I'm so sick of handling these trash journalists.

388
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,339
Hey. How did you get in this time?

389
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,698
Gosh. We tried to stop people like you from coming in.

390
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,940
How are you so good at finding these rat holes?

391
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,060
Hey, you're not a human. Right?

392
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:25,339
You must be a rat.

393
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,539
This rat will sneak in again if we let him go...

394
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,100
without making him pay for what he did.

395
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,219
Why don't you have a drink before you die? Okay?

396
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,659
Look at this rat. He gets to drink free liquor.

397
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,699
Stop it!

398
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,659
Call 911.

399
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:47,499
A man got drunk from stolen liquor and fell off the rooftop.

400
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,579
Okay.

401
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,429
You jerk. What a scumbag.

402
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,540
- You jerk. - Look at this jerk.

403
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:55,869
Die, you jerk.

404
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,980
Just die already.

405
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
What?

406
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,100
Who are you?

407
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:20,819
Are you all right?

408
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:23,389
Who are you?

409
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,139
Can you get up?

410
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:29,219
What?

411
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,259
Darn it.

412
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:50,139
Darn it.

413
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,619
This can't be.

414
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,739
Hey. What's your problem?

415
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,460
Why did you interrupt them? You ruined everything! Darn it.

416
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,219
I almost had them.

417
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,819
Come on!

418
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,979
You just saved him. What's his problem?

419
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,500
He should be thanking you.

420
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:18,388
Was he trying to cash in insurance claims?

421
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,179
Gosh. What a jerk.

422
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:24,819
I'd better find a different entrance.

423
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,139
Do you want me to tell you where you can find that?

424
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,779
Gosh. Why is this taking so long?

425
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:35,460
- We should get a drink today. - You bet.

426
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:36,980
What?

427
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Hey!

428
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:43,299
- Hey. - Darn it. Hey!

429
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,020
Hey, what happened to your face?

430
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,980
Who did this to you?

431
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,939
Kim Yong Min

432
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,779
Remember the guy from the rooftop?

433
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,739
His name is Kim Yong Min.

434
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,139
He used to work for Hanbaek Daily.

435
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:58,138
He even won the Journalist of the Year Award.

436
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:00,059
He was a pretty influential journalist.

437
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,819
But he was caught taking bribes, so he got fired from the company.

438
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,699
He became the face of trash journalists.

439
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:08,259
If we can help it, we shouldn't get mixed up with him.

440
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:09,779
He didn't look like the type.

441
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:23,779
Goodness.

442
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,698
It looks good on you.

443
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,699
Do you think this will work?

444
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,818
Gosh. You wear the suit so well.

445
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,259
Everyone's eyes will be on you in the club.

446
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:38,869
You think so?

447
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:50,699
Yes. He's over there.

448
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,659
Windy, Agent at Black Sun

449
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:55,540
- Him? - Yes, over there.

450
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,659
Mr. Kim Do Gi?

451
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,739
I'll show you to your table. Please come in.

452
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,819
Do you know how much it is to book the cheapest table?

453
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,020
How much?

454
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:41,429
It cost 3,000 dollars.

455
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:45,299
But they can cancel your reservation if someone is willing to pay more.

456
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,100
It's like an auction. You know?

457
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,980
This is weird.

458
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:51,580
Getting in here again won't be easy then.

459
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,298
See?

460
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,429
I told you everyone would be looking at you.

461
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,429
Sweetie, this is your first time. Right?

462
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:09,869
Wear a tracksuit next time. But make it a designer tracksuit.

463
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,179
That works better here.

464
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,539
No one wears suits to clubs these days.

465
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,909
Dancing on the stage in suits is uncomfortable.

466
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,540
People might get the wrong idea too.

467
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:21,619
The wrong idea?

468
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:24,339
You're not wearing your name tag. What's your number?

469
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:28,739
Madam Yang, CEO of YN Entertainment

470
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,659
He's a guest here.

471
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,460
Sorry. I thought you were a guard because of the suit.

472
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,869
Have fun.

473
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:48,389
Go Eun, be honest with me.

474
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,869
You've never gone clubbing, right?

475
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:54,259
Gosh. I mean...

476
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,909
Well, I was busy studying.

477
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:02,298
I don't think she was the diligent type, either.

478
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,299
Right.

479
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,540
I can hear you two.

480
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:06,299
Really?

481
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,580
This way, sweetie.

482
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:39,909
Beer?

483
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,299
So this table costs 3,000 dollars to book?

484
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,389
Paying 300 dollars for this is even too much.

485
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:54,060
That was the cheapest table.

486
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:56,869
Do you see the table across from you?

487
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:00,779
That's 5,000 dollars.

488
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:05,139
And the table in front of the stage is 7,000 dollars.

489
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,259
Look up, Mr. Kim.

490
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,259
The table that overlooks the entire stage...

491
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,819
costs 10,000 dollars to book.

492
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:19,338
Isn't this ridiculous?

493
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:22,819
I even hesitated to pay 100 dollars for a bench at a valley.

494
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:27,819
All right.

495
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,909
Gosh. Let's go and get some food.

496
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:36,139
- Sure. - Who is she with?

497
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,540
Two guards just walked in. They were at the funeral, right?

498
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,619
Hold on.

499
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:53,699
Yes. They were.

500
00:41:54,259 --> 00:41:56,389
Don't you think they might recognize your face?

501
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:01,580
It's not easy to remember someone's face from a funeral photo.

502
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:04,429
If anyone, they'll probably recognize you...

503
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,100
because you were the chief mourner.

504
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,259
Yes, I was.

505
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:12,980
Here's your beer.

506
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,540
Thank you.

507
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,699
How is it going? Are you having fun?

508
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:20,540
It's already boring, right?

509
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,940
What's she doing?

510
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:27,339
It's easy to get a scan of everyone with just one item.

511
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:29,339
A scan?

512
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,580
Well,

513
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:35,219
your annual salary must be under 40,000 dollars at Max.

514
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,738
You used your one month's pay to book this table.

515
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:40,179
You even bought a new suit,

516
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:41,580
but you don't have a partner.

517
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:43,460
You're beginning to regret spending that money.

518
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:45,500
Am I right?

519
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,299
I'm impressed. I shouldn't lie.

520
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,459
They're all huddling together,

521
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,060
so they all seem like equals, right?

522
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,179
But no. This place has a strict hierarchy.

523
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,699
We have everyone from nobles to slaves.

524
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,388
The rich are nobles.

525
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:09,020
The poor are lowly slaves.

526
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:13,020
Why would you divide people into classes?

527
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,060
What about her? How special does she think she is?

528
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,779
See that table over there?

529
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:25,219
They pretend to be nobles, but they're actually slaves.

530
00:43:25,699 --> 00:43:27,219
They're splitting the bill.

531
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,460
All that hard work's for nothing.

532
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,298
Their cover will be blown.

533
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:34,940
There's no hiding or lying here.

534
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:39,298
Are the people up there royals?

535
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:41,699
No. They're nobles, not royals.

536
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:45,259
The royals don't hang out with those beneath them.

537
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:46,779
Cheers.

538
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,900
Only a royal can order that.

539
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,020
What is this?

540
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:01,299
Mr. Kim. Brace yourself.

541
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,060
That set is worth 18,000 dollars.

542
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,259
Isn't that insane?

543
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,060
It's the Emperor Set.

544
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:14,179
It sets you back 180,000 dollars.

545
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,100
What?

546
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:21,819
One, two, three, four, five, six...

547
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:25,020
It really is six digits.

548
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:30,420
I rented my place for 160,000 dollars.

549
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:32,259
What is this?

550
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:03,339
Here you go.

551
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:06,299
Have a good night.

552
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,779
Guard Jang, Black Sun's Head of Security

553
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,298
They're calling like crazy, hoping to find someone...

554
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:25,980
to help them climb the social ladder.

555
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,459
Once peak time comes around,

556
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,179
you are, unfortunately, subject to being replaced.

557
00:46:37,779 --> 00:46:39,020
So have fun while you can.

558
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,860
- Everything's fine. - Watch carefully.

559
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,900
- They want us. - Okay.

560
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:16,619
All the people we need are going that way.

561
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:34,380
Which room are you in?

562
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:37,738
Well... I was hoping to look around.

563
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:38,818
My apologies.

564
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:41,460
This section is for VIPs only, and ordinary guests can't enter.

565
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,980
- I see. - Thank you.

566
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:48,380
Hey, Kyung Eun.

567
00:47:48,819 --> 00:47:50,059
Hey.

568
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,339
There's a place inside that I can't get into.

569
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,298
We're wasting time on the outside, doing nothing.

570
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:56,380
What should we do?

571
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,900
Like you said, I should get closer.

572
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,860
How will we get closer?

573
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:05,940
Will you befriend a VIP?

574
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:08,779
Victor, you got here early.

575
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,139
- Where are they? - Over there.

576
00:48:16,339 --> 00:48:17,460
That's a good idea.

577
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,539
I trust you.

578
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,699
Trust me?

579
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:26,020
What are you doing?

580
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:30,818
Mr. Kim, that's not a good idea.

581
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:31,940
Mr. Kim, don't...

582
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,940
My friend!

583
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:36,219
Who's he?

584
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,420
This is madness.

585
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:42,020
It's great to see you!

586
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:50,940
Victor, Singer, Leader of idol group GET

587
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,819
What, he's a celebrity?

588
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,580
How will he befriend a Celeb?

589
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:00,819
Who?

590
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,739
Do you know him, Victor?

591
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,619
How long has it been?

592
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,380
I never imagined I'd see you here.

593
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,100
Do you not recognize me?

594
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,020
Buddy.

595
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,139
It's me, Kim Do Gi.

596
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:32,420
My gosh.

597
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,618
"How long has it been?"

598
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:38,900
Listen. I don't know you.

599
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:42,460
That hurts.

600
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,939
Pig skin.

601
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,819
I cooked you so much skin.

602
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:50,420
YMS Trainee 2nd Quarter Recital

603
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:55,979
I was so pleased for you when you came in first...

604
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,139
at the trainee quarterly recital.

605
00:49:58,259 --> 00:50:00,980
Even though I came last in 11th place.

606
00:50:04,259 --> 00:50:06,420
Mr. Kim, I sent you a photo.

607
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,618
It's so embarrassing.

608
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:09,698
I wasn't going to show you this photo...

609
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:11,699
because it's that humiliating.

610
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,500
Look.

611
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,218
Whenever things don't work out,

612
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:20,380
this cheers me up, even now.

613
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,060
You were my role model.

614
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,940
You still are.

615
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:37,020
I remember.

616
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:38,818
It's been ages, Kim Do Gi.

617
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,099
Sorry for not recognizing you.

618
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,899
- I'm so sorry. - I almost had a heart attack.

619
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,819
But as you know, so many trainees came and went.

620
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,178
Yes.

621
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:51,380
One of those that came and went was me.

622
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,299
My gosh.

623
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,019
Yes, Kim Do Gi.

624
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,499
I remember coming first.

625
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,778
That's crazy.

626
00:50:58,779 --> 00:51:01,900
Yes. You always came first, I always came last.

627
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,379
This is great. Let's drink.

628
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,338
- Great. Give me a glass. - This is great.

629
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:07,459
- Thanks. - Get it ready.

630
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,580
Raise your glasses.

631
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:09,738
- Here, - Gosh.

632
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:11,459
To Victor!

633
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,379
- Cheers! - Cheers!

634
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,580
I love it!

635
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:20,419
That was incredible.

636
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,460
You must be feeling it today.

637
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,338
Is it not ready yet?

638
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:26,859
- It's almost ready. - Bring it to me quickly.

639
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,979
Let's pick out some dolls!

640
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,059
It's ready. Get up, everyone.

641
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,619
- Come on. - Let's go.

642
00:51:33,339 --> 00:51:34,699
Let's have a look.

643
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,020
Pick what you want.

644
00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:43,060
- The third to the left. - Yes.

645
00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:44,259
And then...

646
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,460
How did a minor get in?

647
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,939
Share the tip, you punk.

648
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,139
There's no tip. It's all about money.

649
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:58,698
I swiped my mom's card to the Max...

650
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,020
and got a free pass.

651
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:02,539
You did pretty well for a high schooler.

652
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,738
Let's go.

653
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:06,739
- Are you paying? - Of course.

654
00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:09,299
There's no end to the shocks and horrors.

655
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:15,739
To Police: There are minors in the club Black Sun.

656
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:24,020
Hey, tell them to get over here.

657
00:52:24,259 --> 00:52:25,299
Yes, sir.

658
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,259
Hey, leave room seven vacant!

659
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:52,699
Heads on the floor.

660
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,020
Hey.

661
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,778
Didn't I tell you to watch the crowd...

662
00:52:58,779 --> 00:53:00,459
before the important event?

663
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,699
- Sorry, sir. - Sorry, sir.

664
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,899
Will you not do your job?

665
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,420
Pull yourselves together!

666
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,380
Hey.

667
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:10,859
Hey, you punk.

668
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,218
I told you to keep that trash reporter out.

669
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:14,980
Instead, you got beaten up?

670
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,100
I'll get the rat and put him in his place.

671
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,060
Okay. Get up.

672
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:24,339
Put him in his place?

673
00:53:25,779 --> 00:53:27,460
You'll put him in his place?

674
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,739
What's up, Boss?

675
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:35,860
Really?

676
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,580
Let's do that.

677
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,060
Send me the punk's number.

678
00:53:42,339 --> 00:53:43,380
All right.

679
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:45,259
Hey.

680
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,298
Leave that trash reporter alone if you see him outside.

681
00:53:49,299 --> 00:53:51,860
He's known to create alibis.

682
00:53:52,739 --> 00:53:54,739
I told you to beat him here for a reason.

683
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,380
I'll remember that.

684
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,020
The punk who laid you flat. Do you remember his face?

685
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,619
No. It happened in the blink of an eye.

686
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:06,699
In the blink of an eye?

687
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,819
It happened that quickly?

688
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:11,540
Sorry, I need to pee.

689
00:54:16,779 --> 00:54:18,020
Is there someone inside?

690
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,219
What are you doing in here?

691
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,460
Goodness.

692
00:54:27,339 --> 00:54:30,860
I came into an empty room, and now it's crowded.

693
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,099
Why are you here?

694
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,779
Victor's in room three.

695
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,259
I really needed to pee.

696
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,218
There's a toilet in there too.

697
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:44,579
Someone was inside, and they just wouldn't come out.

698
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,900
I couldn't wait.

699
00:54:47,259 --> 00:54:49,619
Still, you shouldn't go into another room.

700
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,139
You're right.

701
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:53,460
I'm sorry. My bad.

702
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,500
Follow me.

703
00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:10,819
I'm sleepy.

704
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:12,500
Go Eun, aren't you tired?

705
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:14,619
I am.

706
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,100
I'm not tired.

707
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,619
Why aren't they going inside?

708
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,139
- Who? - The police.

709
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,100
Mr. Kim reported there were minors in the club.

710
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,379
They got here long ago, but they won't move.

711
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,819
Why not? Why aren't they going in?

712
00:56:00,259 --> 00:56:02,179
- Hello? - Was it you?

713
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:10,420
The tipster.

714
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,020
Get him.

715
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:26,860
It wasn't me.

716
00:56:29,299 --> 00:56:30,940
How did you get in?

717
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:35,900
What a loony.

718
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,380
Get him up.

719
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:44,179
Wait. At least tell me why I'm getting kicked out.

720
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,420
Why?

721
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,540
This is why.

722
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,420
Darn you.

723
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,139
We'll protect Mr. Kim.

724
00:56:56,299 --> 00:56:58,138
- You can't! - Why can't we?

725
00:56:58,139 --> 00:56:59,940
He told us to stay away.

726
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:05,339
Can we really do that?

727
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:08,900
Why aren't the police doing anything when they're seeing all this?

728
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,540
- Hey. - Will you hold onto him?

729
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,619
Darn you.

730
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:18,218
Gosh, that hurt.

731
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:19,460
Get up.

732
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,259
Oh, dear. I'm dying over here.

733
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,060
Will someone call the police?

734
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,618
Can you do this? You can't.

735
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:32,259
Oh, gosh.

736
00:57:32,739 --> 00:57:33,980
Call the police.

737
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,659
Hello. You can come in.

738
00:57:40,299 --> 00:57:41,380
Over here.

739
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,298
Who asked for us?

740
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:44,339
Hey.

741
00:57:44,779 --> 00:57:46,460
He made the report.

742
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:50,698
Are you okay? Can you stand up?

743
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:52,259
Oh, dear.

744
00:57:52,659 --> 00:57:54,499
Stand up. Are you all right?

745
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,540
Let's see.

746
00:57:58,739 --> 00:58:00,298
What are you doing?

747
00:58:00,299 --> 00:58:02,980
You're under arrest for obstructing a business.

748
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,940
What the heck is going on?

749
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:21,019
If you have no other issues, we'll head back.

750
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,020
Take care.

751
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,100
I saw it go down myself, and I can't believe it.

752
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,940
Hello.

753
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:51,059
I was going to come to you.

754
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,618
Don't say that.

755
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:56,060
I asked a busy man for a favour. Of course, I should come to you.

756
00:58:56,219 --> 00:58:57,499
- Come inside. - Shall I?

757
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,540
- Yes. - Let's go.

758
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,859
I experimented with explosives...

759
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,939
based on the photos you sent.

760
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,179
Ideally, I'd blow up a car of the same model,

761
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:07,900
but I worked with similar materials in that condition.

762
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,419
The type of explosive, amount,

763
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,540
and form all affect how something goes off.

764
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,060
You can use the debris to identify the source of the explosive.

765
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:20,379
Is it like a human fingerprint?

766
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,460
Yes, but there are only a few of these prints.

767
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,020
Not many offices in Korea can use such explosives.

768
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,019
Ministry of National Defence, NIS,

769
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,779
and the Ministry of Interior and Safety.

770
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,339
These holes are almost identical.

771
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,019
It's the most common pattern from when...

772
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:42,179
I was studying to be a Certified Fire and Explosion Investigator.

773
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,900
It's C4. It's used for special targets.

774
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:51,659
Who would use an explosive that makes this kind of mark?

775
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,738
The Ministry of Interior and Safety's...

776
00:59:54,739 --> 00:59:55,900
counter-terrorism unit.

777
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,540
Interior and Safety's counter-terrorism unit?

778
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,259
The police?

779
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,819
That's what the results say.

780
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,099
The Kang Pil Seung case.

781
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,819
It was really weird.

782
01:00:09,259 --> 01:00:11,338
They wrapped it up as a suicide.

783
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:14,580
You could say the investigation was corrupt.

784
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:18,500
- Mr. Jang? - Yes?

785
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:21,338
Thanks a lot.

786
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:23,980
For helping with something huge without asking questions.

787
01:00:24,139 --> 01:00:25,699
The reason doesn't matter.

788
01:00:26,619 --> 01:00:28,059
Compared to what the Blue Bird Foundation...

789
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,060
did for my family,

790
01:00:30,139 --> 01:00:31,219
this is nothing.

791
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:34,738
I'm even more grateful that you said that.

792
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:37,179
Scene of explosion

793
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:42,739
The explosives came from...

794
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:44,659
the police?

795
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:47,339
Criminal Division

796
01:00:51,139 --> 01:00:53,940
I made the report, so why did you arrest me?

797
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,219
I explained earlier.

798
01:00:56,739 --> 01:00:59,739
For obstructing a business and property damage.

799
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,659
What property?

800
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,179
What property did I damage?

801
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,060
What about the report of the minors in the club?

802
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:11,060
We didn't receive any reports.

803
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:13,739
You must have.

804
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,699
Stop making up stories...

805
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,659
and don't destroy what isn't yours.

806
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,580
You look perfectly normal.

807
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:24,940
You don't believe the report I made about minors,

808
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,380
but you believe the club's security who said I destroyed property.

809
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,699
Without even going inside the club.

810
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,659
Mister, just answer my questions.

811
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:39,699
Hi.

812
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,739
We got the statement. Okay.

813
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,619
Hey.

814
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,500
Is your name Kim Do Gi?

815
01:01:56,659 --> 01:01:57,659
Cell 1

816
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:02,060
You're now under arrest for molesting a club employee.

817
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,419
You should've just had a good time.

818
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,659
Why cause a fuss and bother so many people?

819
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:17,299
You're now truly screwed.

820
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,219
Taxi Driver 2

821
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,419
Don't go anywhere near Black Sun again.

822
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,019
How strange.

823
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,899
I need to go back into Black Sun.

824
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,940
Who's he?

825
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,100
Train him up.

826
01:03:12,259 --> 01:03:13,980
Didn't you say you weren't a guard?

827
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:15,259
I am now.

828
01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:17,658
You're going to mark a VIP.

829
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:19,818
You must protect the bottle that has your number.

830
01:03:19,819 --> 01:03:22,899
If your bottle breaks, so do you.

831
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,618
We're late for the delivery, so speed up.

832
01:03:24,619 --> 01:03:26,738
What does he mean he's late for the delivery?

833
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:30,258
If you'd left the girl alone, she would've had a horrible time.

834
01:03:30,259 --> 01:03:31,819
She tested positive for narcotics.

835
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,618
Why would a club that makes millions in a month...

836
01:03:33,619 --> 01:03:35,178
need to sell drugs?

837
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:36,218
Choi Seong Eun.

838
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:39,059
Wasn't he murdered while looking for the truth?

839
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,460
There's nothing more I can do.

840
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,138
That person who needs help.

841
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:45,179
Don't you think he's the reason we exist?
