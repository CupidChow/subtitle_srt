All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

7
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:34,442
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

8
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:36,002
could make you feel uncomfortable.

9
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:39,242
Episode 14

10
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,043
It's been a long journey.

11
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:57,242
I went on the pilgrimage because I wanted to.

12
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:58,922
Let me get that for you.

13
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:04,281
- I'll tell them to draw you a bath. - Later.

14
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:06,202
Now that I finished my pilgrimage safely,

15
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,202
Mass ought to be held.

16
00:01:10,443 --> 00:01:12,212
Seeing how you lost some weight,

17
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,443
something must have been troubling you.

18
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:17,003
It's nothing.

19
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:21,482
I'm sorry. I was stuck in a traffic jam.

20
00:01:41,923 --> 00:01:46,643
Jangsan Penitentiary

21
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,271
Sacred Heart of Jesus,

22
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:54,922
most holy, pure and full of merciful love.

23
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:59,032
Please show us your mercy and kindness.

24
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:02,685
Sacred Heart of Jesus,

25
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,032
most holy, pure and full of merciful love.

26
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:08,203
Please show us your mercy and kindness.

27
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:13,783
St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle.

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,799
Protect us from the evil...

29
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:19,595
and snares of the devil.

30
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:23,601
Walk to the entrance.

31
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,722
Mr. Kim. You need to wake up.

32
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:28,283
Please, Mr. Kim!

33
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:39,003
You're awake.

34
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:41,443
How long was I out for?

35
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:43,123
A whole day.

36
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,443
Do you remember what happened?

37
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,523
I have a few after-images,

38
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,723
but I don't remember what happened.

39
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:55,082
You really don't remember?

40
00:02:57,523 --> 00:03:00,442
Then you won't know how heroic we were.

41
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:03,403
Do you know what a dreadful driver Gyeong Gu was?

42
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:08,361
You were like the people in the video.

43
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:11,042
Do you really not remember what they did to you?

44
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:16,963
If that's too hard, go back to what you last remember.

45
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:19,482
The last memory?

46
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:21,563
You start from there.

47
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,443
My last memory is...

48
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:33,843
You're a friend of Victor's?

49
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,403
When did you last see him?

50
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:41,523
Not since I completed the delivery.

51
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,243
There's a lot you don't know.

52
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:48,563
Have another drink and give me the empty glass.

53
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:50,123
Okay.

54
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:02,322
You must know this.

55
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,843
If you want this, buy me a beer.

56
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:09,642
What did you give me?

57
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:12,041
It's warming you up, isn't it?

58
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,123
What did you...

59
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:15,642
give me?

60
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,283
It's fine.

61
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:36,083
I found this.

62
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,122
That's...

63
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:41,522
Isn't that the pen recorder?

64
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:44,163
- The recorder from the reporter. - Yes.

65
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:48,333
It's the pen recorder Reporter Kim gave to Detective Choi.

66
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:50,962
No way. How did you find that?

67
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:52,442
Come on. Tell us.

68
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,802
How did you manage to find that when you were drugged?

69
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,242
Taxi Driver 2

70
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:11,843
What? How did you find that?

71
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:14,042
You were right.

72
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:15,963
Wait.

73
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,333
Is it recording?

74
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:29,801
- What's this? - A pen recorder.

75
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:33,083
I need at least a recording if I'm to negotiate a deadline.

76
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:34,403
How do I work this?

77
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:36,202
- Press it here? - You don't get it?

78
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,202
All right. If it's too complicated, keep it pressed like this.

79
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:40,203
Just keep it with you.

80
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:42,001
Once it's turned on, it can record for hundreds of hours.

81
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:44,723
Gosh. This looks like a real pen.

82
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:46,042
Black Sun

83
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:50,523
I'm from the police.

84
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,283
- Gosh. You drank a lot. - Right.

85
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:56,843
- Hold on. - What?

86
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:58,163
Come here.

87
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:00,723
- Gosh. - Hey, sweetie.

88
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:02,723
Goodness.

89
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:05,322
- Didn't I sound just like them? - Yes.

90
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,481
- I sounded just like them. - Hey, get his car now.

91
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:07,523
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,362
Come on.

93
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:24,523
Come on. Increase my fee. You guys always pay me the same.

94
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:27,643
Tomorrow is an important day. Don't drink more. Go to sleep.

95
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:29,723
I got it. Salute.

96
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,843
- Drive him home. - Yes, sir.

97
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:33,922
- We should go. - Seriously. Money, these days.

98
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,442

00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:45,523

Jeongsam Police Station, 2pm

101
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,722
Detective Choi, I switched you with Senior Officer Jo.

102
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,122
You're done for the day. Go home.

103
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:58,601
No. I'm good.

104
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:01,882
Just thank him and go home. He wants to do you a solid.

105
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,561
Right. You should go home early...

106
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:05,203
and win some brownie points with your wife.

107
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:07,602
- Let's go and finish this fast. - Yes, sir.

108
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:11,323
- Stay here. - Bye.

109
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:13,843
Bye.

Collection and incineration of psychotropic drugs

111
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:20,122
I staked out the place for a few days after I got the tip.

112
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:22,602
- I sense something. - Use your common sense.

113
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:24,441
Why would a club that makes...

114
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:26,041
millions a month need to sell drugs?

115
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:29,203
That's why I'm here, to ask you to find out.

116
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:42,122

Back gate of Club Black Sun, 10pm

121
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,883
- Gosh. - Here.

122
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,122
To be incinerated

123
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,883
- All right. Let's go in. - Okay.

124
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:21,122
- Gosh, good work. - Hey.

125
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:22,883
Come here.

127
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,562
- Hello? - Yong Min.

128
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:56,042
You were right.

129
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,523
I just don't know what to do.

130
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,962
What is it? What's up?

131
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:06,722
Where are you? I'll come over.

132
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:10,883
No, don't.

133
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,283
I'll come to you.

134
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,682
You're the only one I can trust right now.

135
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,403
Let me check one more thing.

136
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:31,883
Gosh.

137
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:34,523
What is this?

138
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,883
- Detective Choi. - Don't move!

139
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:38,163
Seong Eun.

140
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:40,681
How could you guys do this?

141
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,523
Hey, calm down. Let's talk.

142
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:44,283
Put that gun down. Darn it.

143
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:47,722
How could police officers do this? We of all people...

144
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:50,643
can't be doing this!

145
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:55,643
Gosh.

146
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,403
- Hey. - Seong Eun.

147
00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:02,763
You probably don't know this yet since you just got married.

148
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:05,492
You're going to need a lot of money now that you're married.

149
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:06,613
Shut your mouth.

150
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:08,252
Hey, look the other way...

151
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:10,562
and think of it as having a high-paying job.

152
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:13,403
You can't ask for a better job than this.

153
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:16,722
- Gosh. How will you fix this? - Okay.

154
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,442
Okay. I'll handle it accordingly.

155
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:23,123
Get off him.

156
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:26,123
Hey, Seong Eun. This is too bad.

157
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:29,922
Don't say my name. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

158
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:35,002
You see, I don't want anything to happen to you, Seong Eun.

159
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:36,722
But the higher-ups don't seem to agree.

160
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:39,613
Don't say my name, you jerk!

161
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,802
- Hey. - Seong Eun! Hey!

162
00:10:51,643 --> 00:10:54,802
Hey. You should have known better...

163
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:57,722
than to act like a hero. This is all pointless.

164
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:00,442
You must think...

165
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:03,082
getting rid of me will end this.

166
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:06,763
- Hey, clean up the mess. - Yes, sir.

167
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,842
Gosh. That jerk. Why did you throw things here?

168
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:13,883
Even if I'm gone, he will never give up.

169
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:18,123
He will make sure you guys pay for what you did.

170
00:11:18,363 --> 00:11:19,442
Who?

171
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:24,123
There's a guy. A guy who hates exercising.

172
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:27,962
- Grab him. - Yes, sir.

173
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:30,682
Get up, you jerk.

174
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:33,082
Don't move.

175
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,123
Don't move.

176
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:41,123
Rinse your mouth.

Seong Eun.

185
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:01,722
Seong Eun, what are you doing here?

186
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:05,243
Seong Eun!

187
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:06,643
Please leave.

188
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:34,722
Even after murdering Seong Eun like that,

189
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,562
I bet these guys are still having an easy life, right?

190
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:42,562
Without feeling an ounce of guilt...

191
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:45,202
or feeling sorry for what they did.

192
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:53,003
Do you like to exercise?

193
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,922
There's a guy. A guy who hates exercising.

194
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:08,962
The last thing Detective Choi said...

195
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:13,123
might have been a message, intended for you.

196
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:17,962
I'm sure there must be another meaning behind this message.

197
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,722
Something only you can figure out.

198
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:23,922
Think carefully.

199
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:51,243
I finally feel my fatigue going away now that I'm home.

200
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:54,682
Thank you for working so hard while I was gone.

201
00:14:57,883 --> 00:15:01,682
So a nasty man has been causing a lot of trouble for our people.

202
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:04,562
It's been taken care of now.

203
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:09,483
Congratulations on getting nominated to be the police commissioner.

204
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:13,883
You will have a lot on your plate pretty soon, Commissioner Park.

205
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:16,442
Congratulations.

206
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:22,603
Are there any changes in our schedule?

207
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:24,643
No, sir. No changes.

208
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:28,122
Tell Madam Yang that I will personally visit her...

209
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:29,883
once I had some time to rest.

210
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:34,482
As you know, I formed...

211
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,962
such precious bonds during my pilgrimage.

212
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:40,442
My new acquaintances are to come on the scheduled dates.

213
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,243
Please prepare thoroughly.

214
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:44,202
I will.

215
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:48,003
And if there's anything Manager On needs,

216
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:50,283
please make that happen for him.

217
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:56,123
Yes, Your Excellency.

218
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:10,363
He's made it clear that Manager On is next in line...

219
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:12,322
with me in the room.

220
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:25,042
There's a guy. A guy who hates exercising.

221
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:34,123
There's a guy. A guy who hates exercising.

222
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:39,403
It might have been a message, intended for you.

223
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:43,123
I'm sure there must be another meaning behind this message.

224
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:46,483
Something only you can figure out.

225
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:49,363
What?

226
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,643
Why would I join that gym? Go work out alone.

227
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:53,042
Take a look.

228
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:55,201
The opening promotion says one of us can get it for free.

229
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:56,841
This is a great time to sign up. Why not?

230
00:16:56,842 --> 00:16:58,882
Besides, you need to work out now.

231
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:01,681
- You're too skinny for a guy. - Come on.

232
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:02,721
It's on me.

233
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,801
Forget it. The thing I hate the most in the world is exercising.

234
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:08,801
Hey. Besides, I should be sleeping when I have time for this.

235
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:09,962
I'm so sleep-deprived.

236
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:12,202
- Gosh. I'm leaving. - Hey.

237
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:16,882
I got you a locker under your name. You must work out at the gym. Okay?

238
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:19,602
Not okay. Why are you nagging me?

239
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:20,642
Bye.

240
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:22,402
- Come to the gym. - Never.

241
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:23,482
Come to the gym.

242
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:28,603
I got you a locker under your name. You must work out at the gym. Okay?

243
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,333
This way.

244
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:41,441
Angel Fitness

245
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,643
This is the locker.

246
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:47,052
Actually, the contract for the locker was ending soon.

247
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:48,403
So I was going to call you.

248
00:17:55,123 --> 00:18:00,083
Kim Yong Min

249
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:13,603
To Yong Min who hates exercising.

250
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:17,603
Gosh, if you're reading this, you must be here to work out.

251
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,681
- You're too skinny for a guy. - Come on.

252
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,333
Why are you nagging me?

253
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:23,962
- Bye. - Come to the gym.

254
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:26,163
Look at you, finally coming around.

255
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:31,403
We should have caught these bad guys together.

256
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,333
Black Sun

257
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:39,282
I'll leave you a present just in case.

258
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,962
But I'm sure you can get them even if I'm not with you.

259
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,522
Jeongsam Police Station, Sergeant Jang Jin Ho

260
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,333
You hate exercising.

261
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:52,883
But you love the truth rather too excessively.

262
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,242
Yong Min, even if I'm not there with you,

263
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:03,002
make sure these criminals who wrong other people...

264
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:05,643
are punished properly.

265
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,573
Make sure...

266
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,522
to bring them to justice.

267
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,643
He made copies of all the files...

268
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:30,482
and put them in my locker.

269
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:34,813
Did Seong Eun...

270
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:39,002
know that he might not come out of this alive?

271
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,603
Detective Choi probably didn't want to give up...

272
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:44,603
just like you.

273
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:51,721
Deluxe

274
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:52,962
I promised...

275
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:55,482
Seong Eun...

276
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:57,282
that...

277
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:01,682
I would bring those criminals to justice.

278
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:12,002

280
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,762
Detective Choi,

281
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:29,123
I switched you with Senior Officer Jo.

282
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:31,603
- Stay here. - Bye.

283
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:32,762
Storage for confiscated items, Seoul Customs, 4pm

284
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,402
- Hello. - Hello.

285
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:36,002
I'll take over the confiscated drugs to dispose them.

286
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:38,813
Disposal Log of Confiscated Drugs

287
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:48,122
Come on in.

288
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,202
Storage for confiscated items

289
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,762
I'll start filming now.

290
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,682
I'm taking over 21.542kg of drugs.

291
00:20:58,242 --> 00:21:01,921
I'm writing it down for 21.542kg.

Disposal Log of Confiscated Drugs

293
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,962
To be incinerated

294
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:15,642
I just confirmed it's 21.542kg.

295
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:18,722
Special Seal, Signature: Jang Jin Ho

296
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:29,282
Special Seal

297
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,083
Please do a good job.

298
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:53,682
Incineration plant for confiscated items at Seoul Customs, 6pm

299
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:55,922
- Hello. - Hello.

300
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,242
- Shall we? - Sure. It's this way.

301
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:05,042
We will now weigh the evidence.

302
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:06,043
To be incinerated

303
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,281
Hold on.

304
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:11,362
Storage of Confiscated Drugs

305
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,083
- It's off by a gram. - That's odd.

306
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,403
Hold on. Could it be this?

307
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:25,402
A corner of it must've fallen off when it was taken out.

308
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:28,042
That's 21.542kg. Confirmed.

309
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:29,043
To be incinerated

310
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:31,962
We will now proceed with the incineration.

311
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,803
To be incinerated

312
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,643
Go in there yourself, why don't you?

313
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:53,602
Okay. Good job, everyone.

314
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:55,842
- Good job. - Good job.

315
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,281
- Are we good here? - Sure.

316
00:22:57,282 --> 00:22:58,363
Shall we?

317
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:04,282
8pm, Back entrance of the incineration plant

318
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:14,883
All right.

319
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:19,083
Nice.

320
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,642
Whoever invented flame retardants should win a Nobel Prize.

321
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:25,843
It made our lives easier.

322
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:28,242
To be incinerated

323
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:35,563
To be incinerated

324
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:36,962
Let's go in.

325
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:38,201
10pm, Back entrance at Black Sun

326
00:23:38,202 --> 00:23:39,522
Nice.

327
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,242
Storage and Transfer of Confiscated Drugs

328
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,043
They've been reselling the drugs that should've been incinerated...

329
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:50,202
at Black Sun.

330
00:23:51,123 --> 00:23:53,521
The drug that they circulate at the club...

331
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:56,843
was gamma-hydroxybutyric acid which is GHB in short.

332
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,803
When consumed with alcohol,

333
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:04,241
one behaves in the same way as a dementia patient would.

334
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,242
A dementia patient?

335
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:09,562
They might seem lucid to others,

336
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:11,602
but they have no control over their actions,

337
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:13,043
nor do they remember them.

338
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:17,843
They become wired to only perform simple commands.

339
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,883
Walk to the end of the hallway.

340
00:24:27,603 --> 00:24:29,363
Get out and cross the road...

341
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:31,242
with a smile.

342
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:51,722
Overseas, the use of GHB is already a serious social issue.

343
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,441
It turns people into zombies who are then victimized...

344
00:24:55,442 --> 00:24:59,281
which is why it's commonly known as a rape drug.

345
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:02,363
Most drugs are consumed for personal entertainment.

346
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:05,202
It's why quality matters despite it being illegal.

347
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:07,643
But it's the other way around for this certain drug...

348
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:11,843
because it's used to violate others, not pleasure oneself.

349
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:13,282
That's right.

350
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:15,802
That's why no one cares about the side effects...

351
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:19,163
or the negative impact it can have on one's body.

352
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:21,603
It makes the drug even more dangerous.

353
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,282
Unbelievable.

354
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:29,762
It launders money for those who wish to evade tax.

355
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:34,043
It's an amusement park for druggies who wish to be wild.

356
00:25:34,563 --> 00:25:37,882
And for the authorities who cover up...

357
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:41,323
the crimes and parties that occur at this club,

358
00:25:41,442 --> 00:25:43,883
this place serves as an ATM.

359
00:25:45,682 --> 00:25:50,482
In the heart of a city bustling with people,

360
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:53,242
a blind spot in the law exists.

361
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:57,363
This is beyond a simple recreational playground.

362
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:04,162
I got drunk even though I hadn't had my limit.

363
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,602
My friend had it worse, but the cops brought her home.

364
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:06,883
We sent in this tip hoping it will help.

365
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,281
What Goes on at the VIP Room of Gangnam's Finest Club?

366
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:12,482
After Leaving the Club, Police Officer Commits Suicide

367
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:14,323
Suicide Victim Turns out to be a Police Officer

368
00:26:19,363 --> 00:26:21,403
Journalist Kim Yong Min, Detective Choi Seong Eun

369
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:24,042
Like Mr. Jang said, if this is an operation...

370
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:25,843
perfectly designed to operate outside of the law,

371
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:28,762
taking the players down individually won't work.

372
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,522
In one swift move,

373
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,123
we must bring it all down.

374
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,962
Black Sun

375
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:57,603
You have no idea how startled I was.

376
00:26:57,922 --> 00:27:01,563
Who knew that the police would get my drugs back?

377
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,043
It was shocking to say the least.

378
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:08,242
How can I repay you for this?

379
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:11,442
I have heard a lot about you.

380
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:13,882
Manager On,

381
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,042
why did it take you this long...

382
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:16,962
to introduce me to this beautiful woman...

383
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:18,922
when she frequents my club?

384
00:27:19,363 --> 00:27:23,163
Goodness. Are you the one who runs the club?

385
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,643
I thought Manager On was in charge.

386
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:30,083
The bishop must trust you as much as he trusts Manager On.

387
00:27:31,123 --> 00:27:32,803
Mr. Hyun Jo can be quite savvy.

388
00:27:33,123 --> 00:27:35,922
Manager On, you've done a good job so far.

389
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,323
Let me know if you need anything or if you have a favour to ask.

390
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:42,722
There's no need to tread lightly.

391
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:49,202
Are you sure about that?

392
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:52,682
I had to be careful as a mere senior superintendent,

393
00:27:53,682 --> 00:27:58,123
but there will be no need for that once I rise to the top.

394
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:03,363
Cheers.

395
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:08,961
I finally know why the bishop has so much faith...

396
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:10,202
in Manager On.

397
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:13,563
You provide the world's safest delivery route.

398
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:16,843
I'm in love with this.

399
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:20,521
The first batch has been delivered,

400
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:23,122
and the second batch will be delivered on schedule.

401
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:25,602
Okay. Once the second batch arrives,

402
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,043
our money will be laundered through your club.

403
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:30,281
That'll be 5,000 for the Hong Kong operation...

404
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:32,163
and 2,000 for the bishop.

405
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:36,883
- I'll report the numbers. - Okay.

406
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:47,522
Sir, I have an urgent message.

407
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,282
It's okay. Speak.

408
00:28:49,522 --> 00:28:52,202
We had an issue while taking care of one of our newbie guards.

409
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:54,123
A newbie guard?

410
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:57,043
Must I get involved with such a thing?

411
00:28:57,522 --> 00:29:00,721
That reminds me. I asked for Number Nine ages ago,

412
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:02,202
but he still isn't here.

413
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:11,162
The food is ready to be served. Should I bring it in?

414
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:13,962
Bring in Number Nine along with the food.

415
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:17,921
The issue involves Number Nine which is why he isn't here.

416
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,281
Why's that? Did he quit?

417
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:22,482
Is that the best you can do?

418
00:29:22,843 --> 00:29:24,403
Who is this Number Nine anyway?

419
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:26,281
Some of the guards went off the grid,

420
00:29:26,282 --> 00:29:27,842
so we hired one from the employment agency.

421
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:28,921
But ever since then,

422
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:30,643
questionable things have been happening.

423
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:33,522
He's also Victor's friend.

424
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:35,563
Victor's friend?

425
00:29:36,643 --> 00:29:38,402
After he started working here,

426
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,282
we've been having a number of botched deliveries.

427
00:29:41,202 --> 00:29:44,682
We had to shut the club down once which kept me from working.

428
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:47,522
What on earth are you talking about?

429
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:52,363
Can I see a photo of this newbie guard?

430
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:55,722
- Of course. - Let me see it too.

431
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,083
Here you go.

432
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:01,563
Yes, that's him. Number Nine.

433
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,242
Family Relations

434
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,442
This man...

435
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:15,563
was here at Black Sun?

436
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:17,883
What the...

437
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:20,242
Yes, sir.

438
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:23,761
I thought he was dead.

439
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:25,762
Family Relations

440
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:28,002
Kim Do Gi...

441
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:31,123
was here?

442
00:30:47,643 --> 00:30:48,722
Rainbow Transport

443
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:52,163
- Get searching. - Search the place!

444
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:54,762
Go!

445
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:04,722
Closed for the day

446
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:40,642
There are signs saying they're closed for the day,

447
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:41,643
and no one is around.

448
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:04,843
Your Excellency, I must tell you...

449
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:06,916
May you be united with the Lord as one.

450
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,467
Thank God.

451
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:14,682
It's not like you to act hastily.

452
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:18,363
It might be wiser to push back the date.

453
00:32:18,682 --> 00:32:20,521
Something has come to my attention,

454
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,442
and we should reschedule once the matter is resolved.

455
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:27,123
Ha Jun,

456
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:30,363
you must be afraid of the evil one.

457
00:32:35,363 --> 00:32:39,123
The operation will commence as scheduled.

458
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:44,123
You will greet our guests who are set to arrive on that day.

459
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:46,762
Should we face an issue,

460
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,441
it will only prove that...

461
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:52,403
you are not to be trusted with such responsibilities.

462
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,323
I shouldn't have said anything, sir.

463
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:58,363
Everything will go as planned.

464
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:01,403
Amen.

465
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:14,722
Kim

466
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,083
Yes?

467
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:25,242
Do you have things planned out?

468
00:33:27,123 --> 00:33:29,123
Kim, it took you longer than usual.

469
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:36,323
Rainbow

470
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:46,482
Rainbow

471
00:33:46,563 --> 00:33:47,722
We should go.

472
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,201
- How much is it? - That'll be 20 dollars.

473
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:55,521
- Here you go. - Thank you.

474
00:33:55,522 --> 00:33:56,921
- Gyeong Gu. - Gosh.

475
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:58,123
- Please come again. - Sure.

476
00:34:07,282 --> 00:34:09,282
I see you all got here before me.

477
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:10,563
Of course.

478
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:16,603
Black Sun

479
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:30,402
D-1

480
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:40,452
Here you go.

481
00:35:13,163 --> 00:35:14,722
What's with all these escorts today?

482
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:16,762
Beats me.

483
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:18,163
That's odd.

484
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,492
Manager On, I think you're overreacting.

485
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:44,282
This is excessive, if you ask me.

486
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:46,842
I'd take that over being dense any day.

487
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:51,682
Overreacting is the way to go right now.

488
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:57,932
Under Construction

489
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:00,842
Darn. What's going on?

490
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:08,002
The road ahead is under construction.

491
00:36:08,003 --> 00:36:09,362
Should we detour?

492
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:13,491
The road ahead is under construction.

493
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:14,563
Should we detour?

494
00:36:16,452 --> 00:36:17,492
No.

495
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:20,282
Clear a path, so they can stick to the route.

496
00:36:23,563 --> 00:36:26,322
Stick to the route. I'll clear a path for you.

497
00:36:28,123 --> 00:36:29,492
Under Construction

498
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:49,043
Nothing unusual happened.

499
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:14,242
We were able to collect the package.

500
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:16,452
We're on the move.

501
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:30,322
To be incinerated

502
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:41,682
What did I tell you? It all went smoothly.

503
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:45,932
This doesn't seem right.

504
00:37:46,202 --> 00:37:49,123
Even I wouldn't dare to fight all the precautions we took.

505
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:54,123
It just means...

506
00:37:55,003 --> 00:37:56,492
that you're a formidable opponent.

507
00:37:58,123 --> 00:37:59,322
You can be at ease now.

508
00:38:06,003 --> 00:38:08,003
I'll head in first, then.

509
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:12,043
Would it kill him to accept the compliment?

510
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:25,083
Black Sun, D-Day

511
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,163
As you can see,

512
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:30,882
the club has been closed off to regular guests today.

513
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:34,242
Go on in.

514
00:38:42,882 --> 00:38:45,123
- Are you good? - Thank you very much.

515
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:51,802
Won't the bishop be joining us?

516
00:38:52,802 --> 00:38:57,123
I was told to say that the place wasn't suitable for a bishop.

517
00:38:57,322 --> 00:39:00,492
Gosh. It's funny how he cares about that...

518
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,603
when he invited so many guests that he met on his pilgrimage.

519
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:07,523
Hey. Cheers.

520
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:17,762
Hey, there.

521
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:29,643
Okay, one.

522
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,932
Two, three.

523
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:35,972
Yes.

524
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:43,881
The money in one of these suitcases...

525
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,492
would be enough to change my life.

526
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:48,932
Having less work will change your life as well.

527
00:39:49,202 --> 00:39:50,322
Don't you agree?

528
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:52,492
Shut it and get back to work.

529
00:39:58,402 --> 00:39:59,452
Next.

530
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:15,842
Yes, Boss. Seems like.

531
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,362
Something very suspicious is going on.

532
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:28,492
I apologize.

533
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:31,762
I'm okay.

534
00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:36,281
The Inauguration of the 38th Police Commissioner Park Hyun Jo

535
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:37,972
Seoul Metropolitan Police

536
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:48,241
Right. Are you all done?

537
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:50,083
The Inauguration of the 38th Police Commissioner Park Hyun Jo

538
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:52,603
Why is that? Are you still not done?

539
00:40:53,643 --> 00:40:56,362
Actually, it's...

540
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:04,003
It doesn't seem like things are sailing smoothly.

541
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:05,523
Manager On.

542
00:41:06,282 --> 00:41:07,402
Manager On!

543
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:13,722
Manager On.

544
00:41:14,492 --> 00:41:15,882
This isn't funny, you know.

545
00:41:16,452 --> 00:41:17,842
I do not appreciate pranks like this.

546
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:21,202
Why was I given flour instead of the drugs?

547
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:29,643
We made the delivery as soon as the package arrived.

548
00:41:30,682 --> 00:41:33,492
Everyone was waiting, so we picked up our pace.

549
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:41,003
Where are my drugs?

550
00:41:42,452 --> 00:41:43,643
What happened?

551
00:41:46,523 --> 00:41:47,643
Why are you asking us?

552
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:49,802
We're clueless.

553
00:41:52,452 --> 00:41:54,043
That's not an appropriate answer...

554
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:56,043
since you should know what's going on.

555
00:41:56,492 --> 00:41:57,932
We only did as ordered...

556
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:00,361
and delivered the package.

557
00:42:00,362 --> 00:42:01,881
We couldn't even go to the bathroom...

558
00:42:01,882 --> 00:42:03,362
since we were told not to stop the vehicle.

559
00:42:04,282 --> 00:42:07,643
Do you not know how important this deal is?

560
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:10,282
Does the bishop know about this?

561
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:18,043
What the...

562
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,043
What...

563
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:43,282
How dare you try to stab me in the back?

564
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:47,402
Maybe it was you who lied about these being drugs.

565
00:42:50,003 --> 00:42:52,043
- What's the matter? Are you okay? - My head...

566
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:53,682
Jin Ho.

567
00:42:54,603 --> 00:42:56,123
Are you kidding me?

568
00:42:56,643 --> 00:42:58,242
How dare you harm the police?

569
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:05,932
Jin Ho!

570
00:43:09,762 --> 00:43:10,882
Why you...

571
00:43:13,362 --> 00:43:15,002
Kill them all!

572
00:43:15,003 --> 00:43:16,043
Get them!

573
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:26,603
Jin Ho!

574
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:38,492
Darn it!

575
00:43:48,402 --> 00:43:49,523
No way.

576
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:52,682
This can't be.

577
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:15,682
Kim Do Gi.

578
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:21,401
D-1

579
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:23,003
The shipment we seized this time...

580
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:25,881
is on a massive scale of about 200kg,

581
00:45:25,882 --> 00:45:28,721
and according to protocol, it'll be sent...

582
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:30,603
to authorities to be incinerated.

583
00:45:31,322 --> 00:45:34,882
We arrested eight members of the gang,

584
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:37,563
and also are after those that got away.

585
00:45:38,043 --> 00:45:42,122
We'll fight the war against drugs even harder,

586
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:45,682
to ensure our country remains drug-free.

587
00:45:46,483 --> 00:45:47,681
Seoul Metropolitan City

588
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:48,802
Police

589
00:45:51,802 --> 00:45:54,523
Entrance to Parking

590
00:45:55,483 --> 00:45:56,563
Let's go.

591
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:00,882
Detective

592
00:46:02,362 --> 00:46:04,562
Oh, what a mess.

593
00:46:04,563 --> 00:46:06,321
What is it this time?

594
00:46:06,322 --> 00:46:08,401
We took the log that was meant to be left inside.

595
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:10,522
- We'll put it back. - No, wait.

596
00:46:10,523 --> 00:46:13,443
The rules say I must accompany you.

597
00:46:13,882 --> 00:46:15,963
Of course, you must.

598
00:46:21,722 --> 00:46:22,801
- Hey. - Yes?

599
00:46:22,802 --> 00:46:24,401
- Oh, dear. - Watch it.

600
00:46:24,402 --> 00:46:26,842
- Watch where you're going. - Let's go.

601
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:33,201
Police

602
00:46:33,202 --> 00:46:34,241
Detective

603
00:46:34,242 --> 00:46:36,801
- Why did you take the log? - I know, silly me.

604
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:38,761
I'm so sorry. What level are you?

605
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:41,362
- I've been here a long time. - Have you now?

606
00:46:41,762 --> 00:46:44,122
- I'm done. - Are you?

607
00:46:44,123 --> 00:46:45,603
You put it back.

608
00:46:50,483 --> 00:46:51,483
My goodness.

609
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:53,962
Oh? You dropped your key.

610
00:46:53,963 --> 00:46:55,682
Oh, darn me.

611
00:46:59,202 --> 00:47:01,642
There must be a hole in my pocket.

612
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:02,721
Possibly.

613
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:05,123
I should get a new pair of pants.

614
00:47:05,282 --> 00:47:06,321
After you.

615
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:07,923
Investigation Room 1, 2

616
00:47:08,963 --> 00:47:10,123
Mission accomplished.

617
00:47:12,523 --> 00:47:14,923
Loading

618
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:18,762
I'm connected too.

619
00:47:22,563 --> 00:47:23,721
B04, B05

620
00:47:23,722 --> 00:47:25,003
Seized Goods

621
00:47:28,643 --> 00:47:29,963
Seized Goods

622
00:47:32,362 --> 00:47:34,522
It takes about five minutes to update the network.

623
00:47:34,523 --> 00:47:36,242
You must get out before then.

624
00:47:36,842 --> 00:47:37,842
You bet.

625
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:39,923
This scale won't work.

626
00:47:40,282 --> 00:47:42,402
You must use the one inside.

627
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:43,923
See?

628
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:47,281
You said we should bring this.

629
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:49,321
Put it back already.

630
00:47:49,322 --> 00:47:51,242
- But... - Put it back.

631
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,842
Be quick! Go.

632
00:47:54,762 --> 00:47:56,043
What a fool.

633
00:47:57,842 --> 00:47:59,123
To be incinerated

634
00:48:03,043 --> 00:48:04,762
Let's do some swapping.

635
00:48:09,802 --> 00:48:11,163
The cameras are off.

636
00:48:11,443 --> 00:48:12,762
You have four minutes left.

637
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,281
Make sure to keep the drugs and flour separate.

638
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:29,083
To be incinerated

639
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:43,842
To be incinerated

640
00:48:44,282 --> 00:48:46,282
We have 198.26kg.

641
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:49,402
Don't worry. We'll get it right in one go.

642
00:49:04,963 --> 00:49:06,043
Short by one gram.

643
00:49:10,923 --> 00:49:11,963
Over by one gram.

644
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:13,643
Darn it.

645
00:49:15,003 --> 00:49:16,043
There.

646
00:49:16,443 --> 00:49:17,603
Short by one gram again.

647
00:49:17,802 --> 00:49:19,482
One gram's no big difference.

648
00:49:19,483 --> 00:49:21,122
No, we can't leave.

649
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:24,523
Mr. Kim said we must make it exactly 198.26kg.

650
00:49:25,483 --> 00:49:28,522
One gram is enough to drug 30 people.

651
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:30,882
There's a reason they're so serious about the weight.

652
00:49:36,282 --> 00:49:39,043
- We got it. - It's exactly right.

653
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:48,322
Lock

654
00:50:01,483 --> 00:50:02,563
Let's do this.

655
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:19,603
Police

656
00:50:23,402 --> 00:50:25,123
Darn it.

657
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:34,123
The road ahead is under construction.

658
00:50:34,402 --> 00:50:35,402
Should we detour?

659
00:50:36,362 --> 00:50:37,402
No.

660
00:50:38,362 --> 00:50:40,322
Tell them to go straight ahead.

661
00:50:44,322 --> 00:50:46,963
Construction Notice

662
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:51,523
He will show up. I'm sure of it.

663
00:51:06,682 --> 00:51:08,083
To be incinerated

664
00:51:16,163 --> 00:51:17,802
Manager On, it's bad.

665
00:51:18,963 --> 00:51:20,762
How is it all in my office?

666
00:51:23,722 --> 00:51:26,163
To be incinerated

667
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:30,722
I wasn't a poor judge of character.

668
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:33,282
He's a real interesting guy.

669
00:52:36,123 --> 00:52:37,163
Black Sun

670
00:52:44,923 --> 00:52:46,083
I'll see you soon.

671
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:49,362
I'll kill you myself.

672
00:52:59,682 --> 00:53:02,482
- Don't move! - Get them all!

673
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:03,923
- Who are you? - Freeze!

674
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,122
Hey!

675
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:07,163
- Darn you! - Don't move.

676
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:08,722
Get him.

677
00:53:13,563 --> 00:53:15,163
Black Sun

678
00:53:26,443 --> 00:53:29,123
Black Sun

679
00:53:37,603 --> 00:53:40,003
Police

680
00:53:41,322 --> 00:53:43,202
- Shoot. - Darn you.

681
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,321
Is it true?

682
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,003
Was there sex trafficking?

683
00:53:47,202 --> 00:53:48,682
Do you admit to it?

684
00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:50,242
Is it true?

685
00:53:51,322 --> 00:53:53,923
Aren't we letting them off too lightly?

686
00:53:54,963 --> 00:53:57,483
Yes. I think they're getting off too easily.

687
00:53:58,643 --> 00:54:00,563
Yes, you could think so.

688
00:54:00,963 --> 00:54:04,642
But taking them to the location our client mentioned.

689
00:54:04,643 --> 00:54:06,443
That's our first rule.

690
00:54:08,523 --> 00:54:09,563
I agree.

691
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,122
Okay.

692
00:54:13,123 --> 00:54:15,802
Mr. Park and Mr. Choi agree as well.

693
00:54:19,802 --> 00:54:23,762
Mr. Kim wanted to make them stand trial.

694
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:30,681
The effect of a string of crimes involving a large club in Seoul,

695
00:54:30,682 --> 00:54:34,043
the so-called "Black Sun Gate" is causing a huge ripple.

696
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:38,522
Narcotics, violence, kidnapping, sexual assault, tax evasion.

697
00:54:38,523 --> 00:54:40,642
All these crimes and more...

698
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:44,682
happened in the open in the center of Seoul.

699
00:54:44,923 --> 00:54:47,801
What's even more shocking is that...

700
00:54:47,802 --> 00:54:51,762
a high-ranking police official was involved.

701
00:54:53,242 --> 00:54:56,563
The government announced they view this as a serious issue,

702
00:54:56,722 --> 00:54:58,681
and reminded the prosecution...

703
00:54:58,682 --> 00:55:01,762
to investigate thoroughly so no victims feel wronged.

704
00:55:04,722 --> 00:55:07,122
Defendants

705
00:55:07,123 --> 00:55:11,322
Case number 2022-K-1135.

706
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:13,603
Defendants Yoo Moon Hyun,

707
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:15,762
Jang Jin Ho,

708
00:55:16,842 --> 00:55:18,003
Im Jong Seon,

709
00:55:18,563 --> 00:55:19,603
Yang Mi Kyung.

710
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:23,722
Defendant Yoo Moon Hyun operated the club Black Sun.

711
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:26,122
To make a profit,

712
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:29,642
he sold an illegal narcotic called GHB...

713
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:31,241
in the club.

714
00:55:31,242 --> 00:55:33,122
He also manipulated and abetted...

715
00:55:33,123 --> 00:55:36,563
the drug-fuelled sexual crimes committed in the club.

716
00:55:36,682 --> 00:55:38,802
When his illegal actions came to light,

717
00:55:39,322 --> 00:55:42,362
he conspired with Jang Jin Ho and Jo Min Geon...

718
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:44,443
to kill Detective Choi Seong Eun...

719
00:55:44,682 --> 00:55:47,362
based at Jeongsam Police Station.

720
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:51,281
I didn't kill him. That was all their doing!

721
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:52,841
Hey, lawyer. You...

722
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:55,082
- Yoo Moon Hyun, it was all him! - What are you doing?

723
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,401
- It was all him! - Defendants. Be quiet!

724
00:55:57,402 --> 00:55:58,922
- Hey! - It was him!

725
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:00,761
Don't you know who I am?

726
00:56:00,762 --> 00:56:03,002
Silence! Defendants!

727
00:56:03,003 --> 00:56:06,802
Defendants Yoo Moon Hyun, Jang Jin Ho,

728
00:56:07,123 --> 00:56:09,083
Im Jong Seon, Yang Mi Kyung.

729
00:56:09,523 --> 00:56:11,802
I sentence them to life in prison.

730
00:56:12,882 --> 00:56:15,321
Senior Superintendent Park Hyun Jo,

731
00:56:15,322 --> 00:56:17,123
a core member of the crime gang...

732
00:56:17,202 --> 00:56:18,923
is now on the wanted list.

733
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,401
Everyone involved who could destroy evidence...

734
00:56:21,402 --> 00:56:24,523
will be tracked down and investigated.

735
00:56:27,202 --> 00:56:29,603
Manager On. What do we do now?

736
00:56:30,443 --> 00:56:32,002
The police are after me.

737
00:56:32,003 --> 00:56:33,603
Do something!

738
00:56:46,322 --> 00:56:48,923
One of us is a traitor.

739
00:56:49,682 --> 00:56:50,762
That has to be it.

740
00:57:01,322 --> 00:57:03,842
It doesn't matter who the traitor is.

741
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:16,402
What's important is who cleans this up and how.

742
00:57:17,402 --> 00:57:18,562
Manager On.

743
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:19,882
I'm so sorry.

744
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:22,762
Before your promotion's official,

745
00:57:23,123 --> 00:57:24,963
you'll have to resign in disgrace.

746
00:57:49,563 --> 00:57:52,122
We recently did a report on Detective Choi Seong Eun...

747
00:57:52,123 --> 00:57:55,563
who was killed while investigating Black Sun.

748
00:57:55,842 --> 00:57:57,922
The suspects arrested for his murder...

749
00:57:57,923 --> 00:58:01,043
appealed the charges and their retrial is set for today.

750
00:58:01,322 --> 00:58:04,802
They were charged with killing Choi who realized their crimes...

751
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:07,242
and making it look like he'd taken his own life...

752
00:58:11,443 --> 00:58:12,483
I don't...

753
00:58:14,163 --> 00:58:16,483
approve of your methods.

754
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:18,563
Of course,

755
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:22,882
thanks to you, I revealed Seong Eun was murdered,

756
00:58:23,163 --> 00:58:26,523
and the punks got to stand trial for everything they'd done,

757
00:58:27,802 --> 00:58:29,322
but it wasn't lawful.

758
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:32,282
One day, when people...

759
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:35,603
learn to listen to what journalists like you say,

760
00:58:36,682 --> 00:58:38,722
people like me will disappear.

761
00:58:40,882 --> 00:58:41,923
Well...

762
00:58:43,163 --> 00:58:46,083
I'm very twisted,

763
00:58:46,762 --> 00:58:48,681
so I'm terrible at saying thank you.

764
00:58:48,682 --> 00:58:51,083
So, what I want to say is,

765
00:58:51,722 --> 00:58:53,762
call me if you want a beer.

766
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:14,202
2,320 dollars

767
00:59:15,483 --> 00:59:17,362
Well, that's not much...

768
00:59:17,963 --> 00:59:20,083
for a deluxe taxi ride.

769
00:59:20,963 --> 00:59:22,761
You stopped talking,

770
00:59:22,762 --> 00:59:25,523
so I wondered if you'd waive the fee.

771
00:59:25,923 --> 00:59:27,563
But you kept the meter going.

772
00:59:29,322 --> 00:59:31,322
There is never a free taxi ride.

773
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:33,563
That is true.

774
00:59:36,483 --> 00:59:38,003
Printing

775
00:59:42,923 --> 00:59:44,362
Hey, so...

776
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,282
It wasn't lawful,

777
00:59:49,563 --> 00:59:50,682
but it was just.

778
01:00:03,043 --> 01:00:04,043
Yong Min.

779
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:07,322
The Black Sun retrial starts soon.

780
01:00:07,963 --> 01:00:09,281
Did you secure a spot?

781
01:00:09,282 --> 01:00:12,003
The place you mentioned is an awesome spot.

782
01:00:17,603 --> 01:00:20,241
The court dismissed the retrial of ex-policeman Jang...

783
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:21,522
and Black Sun operator Yoo...

784
01:00:21,523 --> 01:00:23,321
including others who were charged...

785
01:00:23,322 --> 01:00:25,281
of murdering a detective,

786
01:00:25,282 --> 01:00:26,722
and sentenced them to life.

787
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,042
The judge decided their crimes and methods were of the worst kind,

788
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:33,242
and added the criminals must be separated from society forever.

789
01:00:33,923 --> 01:00:37,523
Meanwhile, celebrity Victor was sentenced to ten years,

790
01:00:37,603 --> 01:00:40,603
and is currently serving time in Bukbu Penitentiary.

791
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:43,682
It's most likely he'll never make a comeback.

792
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:47,882
To ensure the guilty don't get off with a slap on the wrist,

793
01:00:48,003 --> 01:00:51,523
I plead that the public keep following this case.

794
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:54,762
This was Kim Yong Min reporting for Hanbaek Daily.

795
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:04,003
I'll take the taxi out of service.

796
01:01:07,322 --> 01:01:08,322
Good job.

797
01:01:22,322 --> 01:01:23,523
As you ordered,

798
01:01:24,523 --> 01:01:26,801
I'm handling matters so it will end...

799
01:01:26,802 --> 01:01:27,963
with Park Hyun Jo.

800
01:01:28,402 --> 01:01:31,202
I think that's now taken care of.

801
01:01:34,923 --> 01:01:37,003
How should I take care of you?

802
01:01:50,202 --> 01:01:51,402
Ha Jun.

803
01:01:52,043 --> 01:01:54,842
Do you know why you lost to Kim Do Gi?

804
01:01:55,762 --> 01:01:58,043
The arrogance that you were sure you'd win.

805
01:02:03,282 --> 01:02:04,402
That arrogance...

806
01:02:05,523 --> 01:02:06,963
blinded you.

807
01:02:08,802 --> 01:02:12,802
What more can I expect from a blind man?

808
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:15,722
Give me...

809
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,523
one more chance.

810
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,123
I swear...

811
01:02:47,923 --> 01:02:51,123
to make sure Kim Do Gi breathes his last.

812
01:03:27,123 --> 01:03:29,682
Deluxe Taxi Service - Don't die, get revenge. We'll do it for you.

813
01:03:42,362 --> 01:03:43,802
Deluxe

814
01:03:44,282 --> 01:03:47,362
M5283

815
01:03:59,242 --> 01:04:00,682
Will you tell me...

816
01:04:01,722 --> 01:04:03,282
what happened to you?

817
01:04:20,722 --> 01:04:24,443
Taxi Driver 2

818
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:49,321
One day, when people learn...

819
01:04:49,322 --> 01:04:51,721
to listen to what journalists like you say,

820
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:54,483
people like me will disappear.

821
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:56,721
Fights must always be won.

822
01:04:56,722 --> 01:04:58,002
Weakness is bad,

823
01:04:58,003 --> 01:04:59,043
Ha Jun.

824
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,923
They were all a gang.

825
01:05:01,322 --> 01:05:03,923
When and where do lunatics appear?

826
01:05:04,202 --> 01:05:05,202
Stop!

827
01:05:05,203 --> 01:05:06,522
Here, and now.

828
01:05:06,523 --> 01:05:08,842
You won't get out of here alive.

829
01:05:09,003 --> 01:05:10,642
You killed all these kids.

830
01:05:10,643 --> 01:05:12,361
I pray whenever I see their photos.

831
01:05:12,362 --> 01:05:14,482
Cut the nonsense, you psycho.

832
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:15,483
You...

833
01:05:15,484 --> 01:05:18,923
Go Eun must mean a lot to you.

834
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,762
Do you think she's dead or alive?

835
01:05:22,003 --> 01:05:23,282
I'll kill you.

836
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:25,002
I'll show you...

837
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:27,681
how it feels when what you cherish...

838
01:05:27,682 --> 01:05:29,003
is broken.

839
01:05:31,123 --> 01:05:33,083
I didn't forget, I remembered.

840
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:35,563
That's how I was able to appear before you.

841
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,123
Darn you!

842
01:05:38,043 --> 01:05:40,122
- Cheers. - Cheers.

843
01:05:40,123 --> 01:05:41,202
Mark my words.

844
01:05:41,923 --> 01:05:44,003
There are things you must remember in order to get back.
