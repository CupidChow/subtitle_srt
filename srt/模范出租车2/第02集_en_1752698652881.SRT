Taxi Driver 2

5
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,699
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,298
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,819
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,778
Anyone over 18 without a criminal record...

9
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:41,060
is considered a runaway, not someone who's missing.

10
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,139
Look at that! With some studying, he pulled it off.

11
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,980
Your son called the embassy himself.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,458
He doesn't want you to find him.

13
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:52,218
I submitted a similar resume to Lee Dong Jae's.

14
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,578
It took less than 24 hours to get a response.

15
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,498
He spent ten months overseas...

16
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:57,779
looking for his son by handing out these flyers?

17
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:01,340
I'm sure Mr. Jang and Mr. Kim are up to something without us.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,499
Are you telling us...

19
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:09,538
to make illegal gambling programs?

20
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:10,539
Darn it.

21
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,300
Go to your rooms. Start studying!

22
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,539
Darn it.

23
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:51,100

Ahn Go Eun

26
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,459
Mr. Jang.

27
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,698
I thought I told you not to call.

28
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:06,058
Do you see the white button next to the monitor?

29
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,940
- Press that. - What?

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,020
The white button. Press it to get it to work properly.

31
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,339
Did you press it?

32
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,739
It's still not working.

33
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,220
What are you doing in my seat?

34
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,630
What?

35
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,660
I'm in my office.

36
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:27,190
You're not in your office, you're in my seat.

37
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,340
Episode 2

38
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,629
Resume, Lee Dong Jae

39
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,419
Lee Dong Jae is our case.

40
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:47,340
Can I ask what this is about?

41
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,818
Can I get a copy of the files?

42
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:50,979
You can't.

43
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,340
Then...

44
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,739
Can you let us take a look right here?

45
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,339
I'm sorry but you can't do that without the captain's clearance.

46
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,419
- When will he be here? - He's on holiday.

47
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,418
I just want to check something. Could you please help?

48
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,738
Who are you two anyway?

49
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,620
Are you lawyers or something?

50
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,259
We're...

51
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,900
Can I take a look if I'm a lawyer?

52
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:23,459
Pretend I'm a lawyer and let us see the files.

53
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,220
Who are you people?

54
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,500
Listen, mister!

55
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,380
Let him take a look. I give permission.

56
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,060
Who are you anyway?

57
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,739
Who? Me? Who am I?

58
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,539
Who am I?

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,380
Haeundae...

60
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,619
- You could get in trouble for this. - Hey, don't...

61
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,059
Me and your chief!

62
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,698
We ate out together last week!

63
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,939
- In Haeundae... You don't know? - Gyeong Gu.

64
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,138
Get your chief out here!

65
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,019
Where's the chief?

66
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,219
I eat with the chief every day.

67
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,299
In the cafeteria.

68
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,139
Cell 2

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,100
Gyeong Gu.

70
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,539
Did you get it?

71
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,019
You caused that scene for this?

72
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:15,659
Keep it safe.

73
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,100
So that my sacrifice was not in vain.

74
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,380
Do you understand?

75
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,978
When did you take this? Gosh...

76
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,900
Wait, detective. Don't... Wait.

77
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,660
Don't worry too much. You'll be out in a few days.

78
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:39,710
And everything on the file, I took photos of it earlier.

79
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,779
When did you take these?

80
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,378
While we talked to the detective.

81
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:47,979
Why are you telling me this now?

82
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,829
If you'd stopped me from causing that huge scene,

83
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,829
then I wouldn't have to be in...

84
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,459
I didn't think you'd go that far.

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,270
Get lost, punk. Let's go our separate ways.

86
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,539
You're even worse.

87
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,830
- Gyeong Gu. - Leave.

88
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,149
Call when you get out.

89
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,830
Shall I send you food if you're hungry?

90
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,460
Study hard and program well.

91
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,059
It's a prison cell.

92
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:40,259
Delete files with login records

93
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,660
I'm scared. Save me.

94
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,739
I want to go home. Dad. Send me.

95
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,059
Save me.

96
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:52,939
I want to live.

97
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,979
I want to go home.

98
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,660
Web Programming

99
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:12,260
I want to go home. Send me home. I want to go back home.

100
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,100
No!

101
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:27,979
Get out.

102
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,858
- Please don't hurt me. - Come along.

103
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,700
- I'll do as you say. - What a loser.

104
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,378
Don't hurt me.

105
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,978
We gave you a simple job.

106
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:40,538
- Please spare me. - Walk.

107
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:41,619
Darn it.

108
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,460
Shoot.

109
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,820
You're huge and you let him push you to the ground?

110
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,780
- Hey. - He's gone?

111
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,780
Gosh.

112
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:55,419
He ran off but they didn't chase him?

113
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,220
Father's Touch

114
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,179
Excuse me. Help.

115
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:33,699
Call the Korean embassy.

116
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,858
Korean embassy.

117
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:36,939
Dad!

118
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,419
What is it?

119
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,259
Who are you?

120
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,899
- Please help me. - Who are you?

121
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,139
I was kidnapped.

122
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,900
Can you call the Korean embassy for me?

123
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,059
You were kidnapped?

124
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,660
Relax and sit right here.

125
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,539
I'll call the embassy right away.

126
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,379
Get some water.

127
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:56,139
Poor you.

128
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,179
Father's Touch

129
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,260
Why won't the monitor work either?

130
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
Shoot.

131
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,539
My gosh.

132
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:29,739
What just happened?

133
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,739
Go Eun.

134
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,340
Airport Railroad

135
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,659
It's almost time. Why isn't he here yet?

136
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,549
Gyeong Gu. You should've called to say you made it.

137
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,258
I was worried something had gone wrong.

138
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:50,778
You kept me in the dark too. This is me getting revenge.

139
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:52,060
Okay, fine.

140
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,379
Do you have the file?

141
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,859
Do you think it's right that we go?

142
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,658
Don't you get it?

143
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,939
Mr. Kim's here on his own.

144
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,139
Who knows what could happen to him?

145
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,738
Do you think we can even find him?

146
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:09,859
We must.

147
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,779
What if the bad guys have him and he has no luggage or food?

148
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,190
Don't you want to hurry and get him out?

149
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:18,898
Do you have a plan?

150
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,940
I'll explain on the plane. Let's go.

151
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,060
- Shoot. - Let's see it.

152
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:13,189
Darn it.

153
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,618
- Let's have a look. - I have nothing.

154
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:16,659
You, get up.

155
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:20,550
Why must I stand whenever we play poker?

156
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:25,138
Why is the darn beer always warm?

157
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,549
Bring back some soju the next time you visit Korea.

158
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,580
Soju?

159
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,259
Will that cure my homesickness?

160
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,379
Boss. Can't we stay in Korea?

161
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:36,059
I heard lots of the voice phishing guys...

162
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,190
went back home.

163
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,739
We're not like them.

164
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,739
They get the job done with a few phone calls,

165
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,619
but we must keep the program running.

166
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,379
Do you want to get caught?

167
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,060
Boss, have you heard?

168
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,310
The site Hyung Tae's gang made was a huge hit.

169
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,940
They reached 300 in no time.

170
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:56,060
I'm jealous.

171
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,540
If we hadn't lost the program that was almost done...

172
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,498
Why'd you bring that up right now?

173
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:05,540
I'm upset about it, that's all.

174
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,899
- It's your turn. - You. Come here.

175
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,459
- I'm sorry to upset you. - Sorry, Boss.

176
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,579
I'm so darn sorry I deleted the program.

177
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,420
Boss. The guide who brings us the workers.

178
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:18,858
Shouldn't we bribe him or something?

179
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:22,060
We send him on deliveries all the time and it feels...

180
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,739
I don't care. I have a Full House.

181
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:29,979
That must be Doo Sik.

182
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
Let's go outside.

183
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:47,220
Who left this open?

184
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:57,939
Hello, Boss.

185
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,179
What took you so long?

186
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,619
Aren't you disciplining the new recruits, you punk?

187
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,859
Break one of his ankles tomorrow.

188
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:31,940
As an example.

189
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:33,859
Sleep tight.

190
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:38,499
This will shift your blood so it hurts less tomorrow.

191
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,498
Mr. Jang, do you hear me?

192
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:54,939
Sorry. Mr. Jang's not in.

193
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,340
He ran off.

194
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,220
Go Eun?

195
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,460
I haven't heard your voice in a while.

196
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,060
What happened? You couldn't be reached.

197
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,340
I'm fine right now.

198
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,340
You're there to find Lee Dong Jae, aren't you?

199
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,420
There's no keeping secrets from you.

200
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,460
Are you really all right?

201
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:20,060
Are you happy now?

202
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,539
Where on earth are you?

203
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,059
You reached Kim?

204
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,139
Yes.

205
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,699
Their goal...

206
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,379
is to create an illegal gambling program.

207
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,420
Because they can't do this in Korea.

208
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,618
They offered a job...

209
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,619
to lure engineering students.

210
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:44,579
If they're making gambling software,

211
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,220
it's likely they work in cells or groups.

212
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,180
What you saw so far might not be all there is.

213
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,060
The site Hyung Tae's gang made was a huge hit.

214
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,779
They reached 300 in no time.

215
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:59,820
Right. Do you have anything on Lee Dong Jae?

216
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,018
Not yet. I'll look around some more.

217
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,059
It seems more dangerous than expected.

218
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,059
Why don't you come back, regroup, then return?

219
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,180
I agree.

220
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:11,180
The situation's worse than you think.

221
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:15,139
I can't get out alone and leave the other guys behind.

222
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,820
If I do that, the remaining guys will end up in worse danger.

223
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:21,139
What can you do on your own?

224
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:25,899
Can you send me a program source?

225
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,340
That's easy.

226
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,499
Bear with me.

227
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,940
You might have to hurry.

228
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,499
How much longer Lee Dong Jae can survive in this place...

229
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,859
I have no idea.

230
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:53,739
Cotaya Chinatown

231
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:15,580
Is this it?

232
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:18,779
Are you sure this is it?

233
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,300
Look at the map. It's the same name.

234
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,659
Gyeong Gu, you speak Vietnamese too?

235
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,019
Isn't that English?

236
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,180
Let's go inside.

237
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:33,139
We'll find something.

238
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:45,940
Oh, shoot!

239
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,899
Is the punk here?

240
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:12,340
Yes, he's on his way.

241
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,979
Please spare me, Madam Lim.

242
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,779
You moron.

243
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,179
Did you think you could dupe me?

244
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,940
I won't do it ever again.

245
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,180
I...

246
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:38,940
do not...

247
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,739
trust men.

248
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,419
Raid his place and take everything that's worth anything.

249
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,940
And get rid of him.

250
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,379
Yes, madam.

251
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,619
Gyeong Gu, where the heck did you bring us?

252
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:02,059
What is she doing here?

253
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,180
I don't know.

254
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,820
Let me find the place.

255
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,779
That's a good idea.

256
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,780
That would be a good idea,

257
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,659
but we left our luggage over there.

258
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,539
Our luggage? All of it?

259
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,340
Yes, money, clothes, everything.

260
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,990
- Go and get it. - No way. You go.

261
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,139
Let's just go.

262
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,219
The map's in my head.

263
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,340
Let's get out of here.

264
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,060
Gyeong Gu, can I trust you on this?

265
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,659
Hurry! Mr. Kim is in danger.

266
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:36,899
Hurry.

267
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:50,419
Good morning. Did you finish your homework?

268
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,990
The atmosphere in here is quite different.

269
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:57,780
What are you doing?

270
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,899
The air here is so clear.

271
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,780
That must be why I had such a great night's sleep.

272
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,179
Are you teasing me?

273
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,540
It's not just me, is it?

274
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,179
Boss. Take a look at this.

275
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,580
- What is it? - Look.

276
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:15,779
Rainbow Betting Balls

277
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,179
Starts in 2 minutes 50 seconds

278
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,580
Did you write this program?

279
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,269
It's not complete yet. Don't press just anything.

280
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,270
Hands off.

281
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,898
This looks awesome.

282
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,898
We should tell Doo Sik right away.

283
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:31,990
You punk...

284
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,458
- Can you not press anything? - Look at the colours.

285
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,990
You, really...

286
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:41,780
Just look at it.

287
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:44,458
Rainbow Betting Balls

288
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:46,750
We have something incredible, Boss.

289
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,898
Got it.

290
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:57,300
Rainbow Betting Balls

291
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,139
You wrote this?

292
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,300
I didn't get it from a corner store.

293
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,139
I wasn't even allowed out.

294
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,749
You're quite something.

295
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,339
I got a job here to get away from writing programs,

296
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,618
but look at me.

297
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,859
Am I destined to write programs forever?

298
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,300
You made something like this before?

299
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:19,139
Yes, for a while at my previous job.

300
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,269
Where was that?

301
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,219
A place called U Data.

302
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:24,540
- U Data? - U...

303
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:27,020
Oh. U Data.

304
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:30,580
Didn't the boss die in a bomb explosion?

305
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,419
Unknown error

306
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,300
Hey. It's not working.

307
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:38,179
What?

308
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:41,859
That's odd. It was working a while ago.

309
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,270
F5. Darn it.

310
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:45,510
Refresh...

311
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,899
Hey. Why won't it work?

312
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,138
What are you talking about? It was working just fine.

313
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:53,659
Look. It's not working.

314
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,580
What did you do to it?

315
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,580
What do you mean? I didn't do anything.

316
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:08,100
I think you deleted a few important codes.

317
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,099
Did you erase them on purpose?

318
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,618
What's wrong with you? Why would I delete anything?

319
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,340
I worked so hard to write this program.

320
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:18,539
What the heck?

321
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,379
He's not lying. It did work earlier, Boss.

322
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,019
Yes, I saw it work too.

323
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,858
You erased it on purpose!

324
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,299
Pay me back! Pay me for my work!

325
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,938
You dare talk back at me?

326
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:30,270
I should just...

327
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:39,820
You, funny guy.

328
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,379
Write another one.

329
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,540
Okay.

330
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,219
What did I tell you to do?

331
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
What?

332
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:51,899
Oh, right.

333
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,820
I'll prepare the example.

334
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,139
Move it!

335
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:05,749
Hold it up.

336
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,780
What are you doing?

337
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:10,820
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:13,100
Hold on tight.

339
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:14,659
Watch your head.

340
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,139
I'm sorry!

341
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,820
I'm making an example of you...

342
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,939
so others would work hard and not run away, okay?

343
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:23,179
Tell me if you need anything.

344
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:24,749
I won't run away again.

345
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,379
Let me off this once. I'm sorry!

346
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:29,419
I have to do this in one go.

347
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,419
Darn it.

348
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,939
Do you have a death wish?

349
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,270
You told me to tell you if I need anything.

350
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,540
These two majored in graphic design.

351
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,749
It'll take me ages...

352
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,580
to complete the program on my own.

353
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:52,139
I can't do it. It'll take way too long.

354
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:53,509
Forget it. I quit.

355
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,618
You couldn't even pound me to do it.

356
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,299
You cheeky little...

357
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Hey.

358
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,980
Leave him be.

359
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,619
Boss?

360
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,699
Give him whatever he wants.

361
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,699
I should also keep my word.

362
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:10,219
Why you...

363
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,340
Boys, get back to work.

364
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,019
You, stay.

365
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,820
Just me?

366
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,899
- Gosh. - Get up.

367
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,339
Follow him out. Go.

368
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,820
Move it.

369
00:22:34,939 --> 00:22:36,699
It happened before and then once again.

370
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,019
Are you trying to mess up the operation?

371
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,060
Of course not, Boss. I didn't do anything funny.

372
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,300
Why did you do it?

373
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:47,179
I didn't, Boss. You got it all wrong.

374
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,859
- Get in there. - Sorry?

375
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,859
- Get in. - Goodness.

376
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Are you boys going home?

377
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,340
Lucky you.

378
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,739
You can also get back to Korea like them,

379
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,500
so work hard.

380
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:07,699
Run along now.

381
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,740
Have a safe trip home. Don't forget your suitcase.

382
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,138
He must be over the moon.

383
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:14,779
Go on in, boys.

384
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,980
You will eat and sleep here together and come up with the program.

385
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,779
- Good luck. - Good luck to us.

386
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Good.

387
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,340
Are you all right?

388
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,699
I only came out here because they said I got the job.

389
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,378
Don't worry.

390
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:39,419
We'll all be able to go home safely.

391
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,780
In order for that to happen, I'll need you to help me.

392
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,658
I'll go and get my equipment.

393
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:52,698
Just a second.

394
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,699
Have some coffee before you go.

395
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:58,219
Thanks.

396
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,659
We haven't seen each other for quite a while,

397
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,419
but I failed to ask how you've been.

398
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,618
You and Mr. Kim were still at it.

399
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,379
Why did you never call me?

400
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,260
It's because we thought you were doing well.

401
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,260
Actually, it was our wishful thinking.

402
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:21,699
It's been a while since I had your coffee.

403
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:22,899
Delicious, right?

404
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:25,500
It is.

405
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,618
I wonder where Mr. Park and Mr. Choi are though...

406
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,539
and why they haven't been in touch.

407
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,219
Don't bother contacting them.

408
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:38,580
They're probably doing well away from this shenanigan.

409
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,060
They're aware of what's going on.

410
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,858
They came to me recently.

411
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:43,859
Really?

412
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,899
Where could they be, then?

413
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
Gyeong Gu.

414
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,740
Where are we going?

415
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,939
Are you sure we're on our way to Mr. Kim?

416
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:57,780
I have no idea.

417
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:00,859
Let's get off this time when he stops.

418
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,780
- Gyeong Gu. - Yes?

419
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:06,219
I'm hungry.

420
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:09,100
I've been hungry for a while now.

421
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,500
All I see are crops. Would you be okay with that?

422
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:13,340
We'll get off this time when he stops.

423
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,699
That's weird. It was working just fine.

424
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,859
Darn it. Did I really press the wrong button?

425
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,939
You stupid thug.

426
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Type in password to recover program.

427
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:18,219
I'll show you once the program is recovered.

428
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,500
Mr. Kim, I'm getting the data as we speak.

429
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,580
Good.

430
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:28,819
Please sweep the data...

431
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,780
and see if there's anything regarding Lee Dong Jae.

432
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:32,179
Got it.

433
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,019
The leader of this ring is Kwon Doo Sik...

434
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,219
who was once a gangster.

435
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,019
Interpol Wanted

436
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,740
A red notice was issued by Interpol on a murder charge.

437
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:45,899
No wonder. Compared to the others,

438
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:47,580
he seemed to be in a different league.

439
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,340
I think the taxi meter is broken. It's weird.

440
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,019
Where are you from?

441
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,499
South Korea.

442
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,060
Really? I can actually speak a little Korean.

443
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:06,099
This isn't broken.

444
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,898
You're in a deluxe taxi...

445
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:11,139
that charges a higher fare.

446
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:14,859
You call this a deluxe taxi?

447
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,859
I doubt it.

448
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:20,100
By the looks of it, this doesn't even belong to you.

449
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:23,340
Your fare is 6,000 dollars.

450
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,740
- Pay up, you punk. - Give it to me.

451
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,780
Mr. Kim, did something happen?

452
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,340
It was nothing.

453
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:29,379
Did you find anything on Lee Dong Jae?

454
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,340
Not yet.

455
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,659
Most of the data were invaluable programs.

456
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,100
Those that weren't fully developed.

457
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,820
Where could the programmers all have gone?

458
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:42,419
I don't know where they are now,

459
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,260
but they all came here for the same reason.

460
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:47,020
"Congratulations, you have been hired."

461
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:49,939
They all received that text before coming here.

462
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:52,379
They are young men who had a dream.

463
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:55,780
Who wanted to be proud sons.

464
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:58,820
Who wanted to have a decent job.

465
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,820
Did you figure out the identity of the tour guide...

466
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,219
who met us at the airport?

467
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:08,939
I had that done ages ago.

468
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,540
He's actually working two jobs.

469
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:12,740
Enjoy your trip.

470
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,340
Have a peaceful night.

471
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,139
- Thanks. - Thanks.

472
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,260
Republic of Korea

473
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,539
Is this the Korean Embassy?

474
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,579
Choi Young Jin

475
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,500
I'm calling regarding a missing persons report.

476
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,780
My name is Choi Young Jin,

477
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,500
and my resident registration number is 990524.

478
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:02,899
It's just that my family has been calling me nonstop.

479
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:05,740
I ran away from home, you see.

480
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:07,780
Yes, domestic abuse.

481
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,780
Just a second.

482
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,619
I think this is the wrong way.

483
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,699
It's why I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell my family.

484
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:21,899
Now that I am free from domestic abuse,

485
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:25,419
I will fly away seeking my freedom.

486
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,859
Right. Adiós.

487
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,219
Hey, is the game still on?

488
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,260
I said I'd be there soon. Just wait.

489
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,580
I told you this is the wrong way.

490
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:41,020
Do you have a death wish?

491
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,379
Stop. Don't kill me!

492
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
Please!

493
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,260
Who is this lunatic anyway?

494
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,658
So that's how you've been fabricating their disappearance.

495
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:05,419
Who are you?

496
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,260
Untie me right now!

497
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,540
Where is this young man?

498
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,579
Lee Dong Jae

499
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,659
I don't know.

500
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:15,740
Who is he, anyway?

501
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Where did you send him?

502
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,859
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

503
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:23,179
Untie me while I ask nicely.

504
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,859
Just a second.

505
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,500
Wait. Where are you going?

506
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,740
What are you doing?

507
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,658
Wait.

508
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:46,618
I'll tell you, all right? Sir, please.

509
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,340
Sir, wait.

510
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,659
Where was Lee Dong Jae sent to?

511
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,418
I have no knowledge of that.

512
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,300
I only brought the kids to the meeting point, that's all.

513
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,019
How many teams does this operation have?

514
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,060
I think it's four. No, five.

515
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,740
No, four. Wait...

516
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,500
They add teams and dismantle them as they please.

517
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:13,060
Besides, we take orders from the head office.

518
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:14,938
- The head office? - Please don't kill me.

519
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:16,938
I will be good to you and only speak the truth.

520
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:19,418
And where is this head office you just mentioned?

521
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:22,139
How on earth should I know?

522
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:25,060
I only move after getting the call.

523
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:27,100
That's for me to find out, then.

524
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,820
Thank you. Adiós.

525
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,459
What? Hey, wait!

526
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,820
Hey, you can't just leave me here.

527
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:45,100
Help me!

528
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,580
Gyeong Gu.

529
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,219
I'm at the point where I'm hallucinating.

530
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:18,540
What? I think I see him too.

531
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:23,580
Gyeong Gu, it's Mr. Kim! Look!

532
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
Are you good?

533
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,260
Are you injured?

534
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:44,340
Have you been eating well?

535
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,580
We...

536
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,259
We thought you could be in trouble,

537
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,859
so we came here to help.

538
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:53,820
We're here now,

539
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,859
so don't you worry.

540
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:57,540
Don't worry.

541
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,539
- Gosh, this is sour. - No wonder.

542
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,659
I knew there was a reason I couldn't reach them.

543
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,820
When did they head out there?

544
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,738
By the way, we came across Madam Lim on the way,

545
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,619
and it almost cost us our lives.

546
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:18,699
The thought of it gives me the chills.

547
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,540
Why is that woman even here?

548
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,739
Unbelievable.

549
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,738
Lee Dong Jae has to be...

550
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,429
at one of the places they manage.

551
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,739
We don't know where the teams are,

552
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:45,020
and teams are constantly resized.

553
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,540
How can we track him down?

554
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,940
We can't. We don't know where he is.

555
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:52,739
Then what?

556
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,258
We need the teams to gather in one place.

557
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,020
You punks!

558
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:00,429
Do you want your businesses to be closed?

559
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,778
We don't even know how far the teams are spread out,

560
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:05,060
but you want them to gather?

561
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:06,739
And on their own accord?

562
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,739
Yes.

563
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:10,540
Will they be having a year-end party?

564
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:12,460
In what way can this be possible?

565
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,020
We'll have to make it work.

566
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:15,940
How can you do that on your own?

567
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:17,258
I couldn't.

568
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:19,060
But you're operating alone out there.

569
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,580
That's what I thought,

570
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,139
but there's someone here I consider an ally.

571
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:26,659
Mr. Park and Mr. Choi?

572
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:31,779
I get that they can be of some help, but...

573
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:53,909
Hey.

574
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,139
Tao Zi.

575
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:35,909
Wang Tao Zi!

576
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:58,580
Ask around and find out what he was doing here.

577
00:37:58,779 --> 00:37:59,819
Yes, Madam.

578
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:17,299
He ordered two crates of liquor to this address.

579
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,460
Father's Touch

580
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,060
What the...

581
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,179
You stupid thug.

582
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,299
Darn it.

583
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,138
Why isn't the guide picking up?

584
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,459
Aren't we getting a fresh batch of boys today?

585
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,868
Maybe he got wasted last night and is still sleeping it off.

586
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:43,099
He wasn't at the airport and can't be reached.

587
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,339
Now he's just getting on my nerves.

588
00:39:57,779 --> 00:39:59,909
Wait. Hold on.

589
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:05,779
Hey, hand me the binoculars.

590
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:08,619
Who are those punks?

591
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Darn it.

592
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:21,819
They seem to be coming our way.

593
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,908
Hurry down and lock the front gate.

594
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:24,940
Got it.

595
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:34,659
I wonder what Madam Lim...

596
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,259
thinks of me now.

597
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:46,139
Wang Tao Zi.

598
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,580
Today, I will rip you to pieces.

599
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:52,219
Go!

600
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:05,980
From Guide: Get out of there!

601
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:08,299
Darn it.

602
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:11,980
They must've gotten to him before he could contact us.

603
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,059
- What do we do? - Go to the head office.

604
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,428
Call the other teams!

605
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:16,580
The other teams?

606
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:17,939
They have our guide...

607
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,060
which means our organization will soon be exposed.

608
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:24,779
Go!

609
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
Wait.

610
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,818
Can we go to the head office without the chairman's approval?

611
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:40,218
We won't hear the end of it.

612
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:42,939
I'd take that over getting crushed by those punks.

613
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,739
Get the boys and leave through the back door!

614
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,869
Who are we looking for in here?

615
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,460
The most handsome punk.

616
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,428
You are to look for the most handsome punk!

617
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:04,869
- Find the most handsome punk! - Find the most handsome punk!

618
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:08,429
We're moving!

619
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,139
- He's not here. - You dimwit!

620
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,499
They must've all made a run for it.

621
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,139
You useless punk!

622
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:21,779
I had...

623
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:25,739
something to ask you.

624
00:43:37,259 --> 00:43:41,940
Wang Tao Zi!

625
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,900
All right. Hurry up. Move it.

626
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:34,020
Come on. Hurry.

627
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:35,939
Faster, guys.

628
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,459
Cheongeum's Head Office in Cotaya

629
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,580
Get out of the car already.

630
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,779
The other teams must have arrived as well.

631
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:46,299
They all seem severely injured.

632
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:49,819
Don't just stand there and watch. Get moving.

633
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,540
- You slow pokes. - Move it. Darn it.

634
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:09,380
Hurry up.

635
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:12,179
Right here. Sit down.

636
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,419
Get on your knees. Come on. Do it.

637
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,980
Kneel down, you jerks. Come on. Do what you're told.

638
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:19,100
Aren't you Korean?

639
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,860
Seriously. I'm getting hot because you're frustrating me.

640
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:33,819
I told you not to come here without my permission.

641
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,980
You even brought the other teams with you?

642
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:39,339
I'm sorry. It was an urgent situation.

643
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,778
- You little... - Gosh. I'm sorry.

644
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:45,580
So it was an urgent situation.

645
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,540
This world is full of evil people.

646
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:10,779
Kim Hyung Sub

647
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,659
You're just following protocol.

648
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,778
If we cross the line...

649
00:46:16,779 --> 00:46:18,818
and ignore protocol just because we can,

650
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:22,060
we'll be going from police officers to offenders of the law.

651
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:26,698
I'm sorry for the commotion, Mr. Chairman.

652
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:30,020
It's okay. Here's what I think.

653
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:33,940
Someone might have come up with this ruse...

654
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,900
to come here.

655
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,020
Mr. Kim.

656
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,139
That chairman...

657
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:44,339
is a cop.

658
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:47,219
He's the captain who handled Lee Dong Jae's case.

659
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:53,778
There's nothing we can do for you...

660
00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:56,539
when someone of age refuses to be contacted.

661
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,818
They evaluated the handwriting,

662
00:46:57,819 --> 00:46:59,219
and it was written by the same person.

663
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,100
It doesn't hurt to always be cautious.

664
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:07,020
If you haven't gotten all of their suicide notes,

665
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,500
make sure to get everyone's.

666
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:10,339
And handle them.

667
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,339
- Yes, sir. - Bring me a cool drink.

668
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,020
Bye, sir!

669
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:17,419
Didn't you hear him, you slow pokes?

670
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,298
- Hurry up! Come inside. - Hey. Let's go.

671
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:21,539
- Get going! - Hurry up. Move it.

672
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,059
- Didn't you hear him? Hurry. - Move it.

673
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,259
Darn it. What do we do?

674
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,619
All right. Write down exactly what I say.

675
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:36,739
"Life is so hard."

676
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,699
"Bye, everyone."

677
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,259
Hey, you're here.

678
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,819
Lucky seven.

679
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:55,459
Let's start with 7 for the 1st round.

680
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,738
We'll finish the rest after dinner.

681
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:57,739
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

682
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,980
Right. The guys in the previous batch are still alive, right?

683
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,580
- Yes. - Get them ready.

684
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:06,299
- Hey. Dump it in. - Come on.

685
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,940
- Do it properly. - Sorry.

686
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,818
You really are making a mess here.

687
00:48:10,819 --> 00:48:11,860
- Gosh. - Should I do it?

688
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,940
You have to stop saying you don't know.

689
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,179
You should study and try to figure it out.

690
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:31,139
I don't have all day here! Write it up now!

691
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,099
You jerks ditched your family and came here to have it easy...

692
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,699
while enjoying the nice view here.

693
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,818
If you have any conscience at all,

694
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:39,899
the least you can do is write them a letter.

695
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,540
You'd better start writing it now.

696
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,460
You selfish jerks.

697
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:51,739
You're wrong.

698
00:48:54,339 --> 00:48:55,380
What?

699
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,739
Who just talked back?

700
00:49:15,139 --> 00:49:17,779
We didn't come here to have it easy without our family.

701
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,699
We came here to work.

702
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,380
So we could use our paychecks to do nice things for our family.

703
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,779
You punk. Have you gone mad?

704
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,540
That's why we're here.

705
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,299
When did you untie your hands?

706
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,819
But people like you...

707
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,900
would never understand it.

708
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,619
What are you guys doing? Kill that jerk already!

709
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,060
He's getting away!

710
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:55,699
Calm down.

711
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:57,940
I was just following orders.

712
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:11,020
Passport, Republic of Korea

713
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,060
Name: Lee Ji Hoon

714
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:24,739
Are you boys going home?

715
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,940
Lucky you.

716
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,100
Are you all right?

717
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,060
Take care of the rest.

718
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:49,299
We have a problem, sir.

719
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:54,698
You have a room full of guys. They couldn't handle one guy?

720
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:55,819
How is that possible?

721
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,460
I got it, sir. Move it!

722
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,819
Yes. I already secured the money.

723
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,860
Yes. I'll hurry.

724
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:16,380
Police!

725
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,139
Let us handle the rest. You should get going!

726
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,819
- Okay. - Thank you.

727
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,540
Police!

728
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,500
Gyeong Gu. What do we do next? These are BB guns.

729
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:42,778
Don't shoot. Whatever happens, don't shoot.

730
00:53:42,779 --> 00:53:43,779
Okay.

731
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:47,580
Go Eun, can you hear me?

732
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:49,779
Yes, Mr. Kim.

733
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,739
We must find out where the chairman went.

734
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,739
I just located the captain.

735
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,819
He's heading to the amusement park at the end of the river.

736
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,460
I'm still too far behind.

737
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,178
I'll try to buy you some time.

738
00:54:52,179 --> 00:54:53,540
There might be a way to do that.

739
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,100
Mr. Kim.

740
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,299
Make a detour. There's a shortcut.

741
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:33,900
You're closing in on him.

742
00:56:35,779 --> 00:56:37,179
There's no way out on the rooftop.

743
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,380
Who are you?

744
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,338
You must have been busy...

745
00:56:55,339 --> 00:56:56,540
running this operation...

746
00:56:56,739 --> 00:56:58,060
and working as a cop.

747
00:56:58,779 --> 00:56:59,860
Do you know me?

748
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:03,219
You're a police officer. Aren't you even ashamed of yourself?

749
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,339
You see,

750
00:57:06,699 --> 00:57:08,979
catching criminals in Korea...

751
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,299
is pointless.

752
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,020
Why?

753
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:16,500
Because those criminals have it better in the end.

754
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:18,380
What choice did I have?

755
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:21,900
I had to take care of myself. Don't you agree?

756
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,580
So did you take a look at yourself...

757
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,500
in the mirror?

758
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:30,779
You committed crimes...

759
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:32,659
and covered up the truth.

760
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,940
I see a dirty cop...

761
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,460
who turned into a despicable old man.

762
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:38,619
You...

763
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:44,540
An old, dirty cop.

764
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,020
Too bad.

765
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,020
I may be old,

766
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:51,739
but your time might be up before mine, young man.

767
00:58:14,779 --> 00:58:16,020
Mr. Kim!

768
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:18,020
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

769
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:15,099
- A large-scale organization... - Hey, that hurts.

770
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,979
had been operating illegal gambling websites abroad.

771
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,258
- The members of the organization... - Hurry.

772
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:19,539
were arrested abroad and extradited to Korea.

773
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,658
Many of them were violent gangsters.

774
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,258
To avoid murder charges, they led the lives of fugitives abroad.

775
00:59:25,259 --> 00:59:27,698
And Interpol had issued a Red Notice as well.

776
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:29,738
In order to operate illegal gambling websites,

777
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:30,899
they lured young men in their 20s...

778
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,658
by pretending to offer a job abroad.

779
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:33,859
- They kidnapped these young men... - Stop taking pictures...

780
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,979
- and forced them to make... - if you don't know the whole story.

781
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,099
- illegal gambling websites. - I did nothing wrong!

782
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,338
This discovery shocked the nation.

783
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:38,698
The police charged the extradited men...

784
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:41,618
for murder, abduction, assault, and confinement.

785
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,100
And they are investigating the details of the case now.

786
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:50,060
Deluxe

787
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,060
Missing, Name: Lee Dong Jae

788
01:00:03,219 --> 01:00:05,380
Missing, Name: Lee Dong Jae

789
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:16,259
Deluxe

790
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:28,900
Dad.

791
01:00:34,779 --> 01:00:35,819
Dong Jae...

792
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,619
Dong Jae!

793
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,819
Dad...

794
01:00:41,299 --> 01:00:42,420
Dad.

795
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,460
Are you okay?

796
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,460
Yes.

797
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,059
Are you hurt?

798
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:18,020
I'm okay.

799
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,380
My son.

800
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:22,659
I'm okay, Dad.

801
01:01:22,819 --> 01:01:24,619
Seoul 24 M5283

802
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:28,339
Deluxe

803
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,939
I found all of their illegal gambling websites...

804
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,460
and shut them down.

805
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:38,060
Good work, Go Eun.

806
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,500
That's not it.

807
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,860
Don't you remember?

808
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:57,619
I'll take the taxi out of service.

809
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:24,380
Letter of Resignation

810
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:28,380
Do you have a plan?

811
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:31,139
I'll go back to where I belong.

812
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,779
Where do you belong?

813
01:02:59,259 --> 01:03:00,699
My company processed my letter of resignation.

814
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,619
- What? - That's unexpected. Mine too.

815
01:03:03,819 --> 01:03:04,819
What?

816
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,178
- Welcome back. - You're back.

817
01:03:11,179 --> 01:03:13,739
- There you are. - What took you so long?

818
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,139
Hello.

819
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,580
Where is the office?

820
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:31,020
Go to the second floor.

821
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,819
The second floor? Thank you.

822
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:50,819
Hello. I'm On Ha Jun. This is my first day here.

823
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,179
Is anyone here?

824
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:56,020
All right. Then is everyone here?

825
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,259
Then let's get started again.

826
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,739
Taxi Driver 2

827
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:25,100
I took care of it.

828
01:04:32,299 --> 01:04:34,179
I'll find out who he is.

829
01:04:52,259 --> 01:04:55,658
5283 beginning service. Tell us your stories of injustice.

830
01:04:55,659 --> 01:05:00,060
Korean Crime Victims Support Association

831
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:02,659
We have a senior citizen as our client this time.

832
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:04,499
He's been commenting...

833
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,459
all kinds of crimes against senior citizens.

834
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,859
The old lady treats him like her grandson.

835
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:09,939
She's clueless about his malicious intent.

836
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,579
Can I ask you for a different favour?

837
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,059
If you sign up for this,

838
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,818
I'll get tens of dollars for commission.

839
01:05:14,819 --> 01:05:16,859
- The financial damage is quite big. - Jerks.

840
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,219
That's no way to greet your customer. Not even a hello?

841
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,258
Mom, just take it as your burden and die in debt.

842
01:05:23,259 --> 01:05:24,298
Nine!

843
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:25,499
What should we do with those jerks?

844
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,500
We should give them a taste of their own medicine.
