Taxi Driver 2

5
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,178
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:34,099
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,860
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,699
We'll take you into surgery.

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,219
Park Dong Sung

10
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,899
Make it look like I have what Han Su Ryeon had.

11
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,778
What if you get operated on by mistake?

12
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:59,020
You'll get anaesthetized.

13
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,700
If that happens, you can figure it out for me.

14
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:06,020
See if it's an accident or an incident.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,059
It's a super-wide angle lens with no blind spots.

16
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:13,458
The camera sensor will be up and running.

17
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,508
Turn it on three minutes after I go inside.

18
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,059
If the alarm goes off then, they'll think it's a malfunction.

19
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,100
You'll make them turn it off?

20
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:22,419
This might smell odd.

21
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,059
No signal

22
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:38,819
Open your eyes, sir.

23
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:42,500
He's ready.

24
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:50,219
Didn't anyone check why he came in wearing glasses?

25
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,220
- Sorry. - Sorry.

26
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,580
I don't care. I waited long enough.

27
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,059
Why did that go off now?

28
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,259
I almost died.

29
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:22,819
Let's begin, Dr. Gong.

30
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:29,419
"Dr. Gong?"

31
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,819
I'll be inside. Call me if something happens.

32
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,019
Wait.

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,380
Where did he come from?

34
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,979
He's going to perform the surgery?

35
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:37,179
Yes, you've reached the operating room.

36
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,059
Mr. Park Dong Sung is asking when he'll get his surgery.

37
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,978
He's been complaining about the delay.

38
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,179
We're operating on him now.

39
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,979
What? He's waiting outside right now.

40
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,620
What do you mean the patients have been switched?

41
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,060
I'm not sure either.

42
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,340
Park Dong Sung

43
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:28,058
Transfer the patient inside back to his room.

44
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,779
Give him an IV vitamin treatment.

45
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,780
Yes, doctor.

46
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,830
Taxi Driver 2

47
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,460
Episode 10

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,270
How are you feeling? Are you in any pain?

49
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,149
I'd better be in tip-top shape.

50
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,580
After all, I slept for hours.

51
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,899
The layout of the surgery doesn't match the floor plan.

52
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,780
There's a back door that never existed in the plan.

53
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,220
Dr. Gong.

54
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,538
Given the way it's set up,

55
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:11,099
no one outside the OR would know about his existence.

56
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,299
They must have changed the layout with his role in mind.

57
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,340
If you hadn't been in the OR, we would have never known.

58
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:20,780
In that sense, you deserve my praise.

59
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,900
You saw the whole thing. I was asleep the whole time.

60
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:27,220
In that sense, you deserve my praise.

61
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:38,220
You came to our hospital as an ER patient last night.

62
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,619
In a traffic accident.

63
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
Yes.

64
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,140
This hospital was closer from my house.

65
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:49,299
Gosh. You can walk just fine.

66
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,179
Given the diagnosis you have, it must be painful to walk.

67
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:01,260
Gosh. No wonder why it hurt so much.

68
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,419
There must have been an error in our system.

69
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,179
As the director of the hospital, I would like to apologize.

70
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Okay.

71
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,459
But our hospital specializes in surgery.

72
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,460
We don't accept patients from traffic accidents.

73
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:16,299
You should transfer to another hospital.

74
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,859
Well, seeing how you can walk just fine,

75
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:20,739
you can go home too.

76
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,820
But I'm in pain.

77
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,339
Let's get you discharged.

78
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,939
I'm in real pain.

79
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,379
- I know that you're faking it. - It really hurts!

80
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,459
Have you been stabbed in the OR?

81
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,619
It hurts so much! It's no joke.

82
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,618
- Oh, no. - So am I to understand that...

83
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,660
you're demanding settlement money from me?

84
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,020
No way. I'm not some con man.

85
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,499
I just need to get treated.

86
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,619
I see.

87
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,539
Gosh.

88
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,739
How should we treat Mr. Kim Do Gi?

89
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,340
Give him a lot of shots on a regular basis.

90
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,660
Yes, doctor.

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,179
Oh, my.

92
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,020
Kim Do Gi, Kim Jin Soo, Joo Young Eun

93
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,220
It's time for your shot.

94
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,019
Hey, Mr. Kim isn't in his bed.

95
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,140
- Leave him alone. - What?

96
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,820
He's here for his insurance claim.

97
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:31,460
I see.

98
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:06,220
Pay Parking Here

99
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,820
No-Smoking Building

100
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,419
Meditopia

101
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,859
"Meditopia."

102
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,820
"Meditopia."

103
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:28,660
Meditopia

104
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,220
Why Do Manufacturers Matter for Artificial Joints?

105
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,419
This company manufactures medical supplies and equipment.

106
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,659
Meditopia

107
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:25,340
Meditopia

108
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,220
Yes, Director.

109
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,379
Yes. I'll head over there now.

110
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,379
Meditopia

111
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,778
Meditopia

112
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,379
Medical Equipment

113
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:26,019
Chief Gong Soo Ho of Medical Sales Team for Meditopia.

114
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:28,940
It's confirmed that he's not a doctor.

115
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,979
Surgery schedule

116
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:41,940
This can't be.

117
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,820
He's performing all of those surgeries?

118
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,429
Ji Sang Jin, Jung Ji An, Kim Yoon Sik

119
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,309
Im Hong Gyu, Kwang Sook Young, Lee Ho Jin, Park Sun Young

120
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,060
Kim Hyung Woo, An Sung Ho, Heo Ji Yeon, Kim Hwa Ja

121
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,619
Aren't you curious...

122
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:01,138
if the person who performs the most surgeries in this district...

123
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,739
is indeed Director Ahn Young Sook...

124
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,180
or...

125
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,460
Chief Gong Soo Ho, Medical Sales Team

126
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:09,180
if it's Chief Gong Soo Ho.

127
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,498
Gong Soo Ho

128
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,858
This kind of symbiotic relationship can be seen...

129
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:27,019
between crocodiles and plover birds. Right?

130
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,219
If she couldn't perform surgery,

131
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,378
she should have hired another doctor who could.

132
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:33,978
Why is she making an unlicensed salesman fill in for her?

133
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:35,220
It's about money.

134
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,460
Doctors get paid a lot.

135
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,220
If she could make a salesman to be her ghost surgeon,

136
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,899
she would save up a lot of money.

137
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:43,899
Take a look at this.

138
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,659
Petition for a Change of Name

139
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,220
I didn't know because Director Ahn changed her name.

140
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,220
But I found something interesting.

141
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:59,220
Her name went from Ahn Ji Eun to Ahn Young Sook.

142
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,659
She changed her name four years ago.

143
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,659
She changed her name?

144
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,259
So I looked her up by her previous name.

145
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:07,820
She ran a private clinic outside the metropolitan area.

146
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,019
Doctor Gets License Suspended for Hiring a Salesman for Surgery

147
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,579
She paid a fine back then for doing the exact same thing...

148
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,299
she's doing right now.

149
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,059
Gosh. Who knew she was a repeat offender?

150
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,940
Shouldn't her license get revoked given what she did?

151
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,978
Her suspension was lifted after six months.

152
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,979
- What? - It got lifted?

153
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,138
She can be a doctor again?

154
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:32,498
After her suspension got lifted, what do you think...

155
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:33,899
Director Ahn Ji Eun did?

156
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:37,340
She changed her name from Ahn Ji Eun to Ahn Young Sook.

157
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,179
She erased her past.

158
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,220
Bingo.

159
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,258
So she opened up a new hospital.

160
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:48,659
She went back to her old playbook.

161
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,299
She's making a salesman do surgery as if she's running a factory.

162
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,540
How dare she name the hospital "The Kindest Hospital?"

163
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,019
The ruling from the court made her more confident.

164
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,259
I'm sorry I'm late.

165
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:09,739
Was there a traffic jam?

166
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,180
Or did you not want to come?

167
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:15,100
Of course, I wanted to come. I rushed over right away.

168
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,180
If you need anything else, ask for Cha Eun Woo at the bar.

169
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,420
Have a good time then.

170
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,539
There are 7 surgeries scheduled in 2 days.

171
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,700
You should come to work earlier than usual.

172
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,420
Yes, ma'am.

173
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,459
Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you.

174
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,979
It's my mother's death anniversary in two days.

175
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,460
I don't think I'll be available for surgery that day.

176
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:54,060
Then don't come to work.

177
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,420
I'll look for someone else.

178
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:59,019
- That's not what I meant. - Then what?

179
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,499
Should I charge you for all of the surgical fees?

180
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,700
I don't have that kind of money.

181
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,419
Then are you asking me to bear the financial burden?

182
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
I'm very disappointed in you.

183
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:13,060
This is a small field.

184
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,699
You must know better than anyone...

185
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,619
what happens once people find out you're not reliable.

186
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:19,220
Right. I was shortsighted.

187
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,138
I'll be at the hospital on time.

188
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:22,820
People like us...

189
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,659
must prioritize surgery, first and foremost.

190
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,220
Isn't that right?

191
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,940
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,820
It's all thanks to buying our equipment...

193
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:35,820
instead of other company's.

194
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:37,820
Thank you, ma'am.

195
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,540
I must be even more famous than now.

196
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,619
So must be my hospital.

197
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,700
Then...

198
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:50,060
I'll make you the deputy director of administration.

199
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,219
With that said, this is on me today.

200
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,899
No. I brought my company card.

201
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,219
You can't keep putting it on your company card.

202
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,060
What if your CEO scolds you?

203
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,100
It's okay, ma'am.

204
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:04,060
All right. Let's get going.

205
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,379
Let's go and make money.

206
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,019
Pardon? There was surgery scheduled today too?

207
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,499
There are only two surgeries today.

208
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,939
Gosh. I'm so forgetful.

209
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,019
I must have forgotten to tell you.

210
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:20,978
Go to your office, get your things, and wait.

211
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,420
I'll send you a car. Come to work in that car.

212
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,820
And pay for two more bottles of liquor on your way out.

213
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,019
See you later.

214
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,378
She's been using his company card to pay for her drinks.

215
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,180
No wonder why I didn't find anything on her credit card statement.

216
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,060
The person who performs the most surgeries in the district...

217
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,700
isn't Director Ahn Young Sook. That's been confirmed now.

218
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:48,059
Based on what we just heard, if they go ahead with the schedule,

219
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,940
they're about to perform surgery again while intoxicated.

220
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,739
Right. They cannot perform surgery. Never.

221
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,220
Deluxe

222
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,258
Darn it. She could have just called a taxi for him.

223
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,820
She's racking up the mileage.

224
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:11,420
Gosh, what a cheapskate.

225
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:16,379
Gosh. What a slick ride.

226
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,259
Fine. I'm putting up with this for you, my baby.

227
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:25,340
What?

228
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,820
Who did this to my baby?

229
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,739
Oh, no. This is dirty.

230
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,379
Darn it. What's taking so long?

231
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,499
Hey!

232
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:56,220
You jerk. You're dead meat when I catch you. Come on.

233
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,419
Chief Gong Soo Ho, I'm here to pick you up.

234
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,619
Please get in.

235
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,820
Please make the call later.

236
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,990
I have a few questions for you.

237
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:42,699
Pardon?

238
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:55,899
Who are you?

239
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,219
You know a patient named Han Su Ryeon, right?

240
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,060
Seeing how you recognize her name, you did operate on her.

241
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,580
Spare me.

242
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,859
Tell me what happened in the OR that day.

243
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:20,780
Tell me the truth.

244
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,510
Operating Room Status: Han Su Ryeon, In surgery

245
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:31,510
Surgery Waiting Room

246
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,419
Han Su Ryeon

247
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:40,780
Give me the gauze pads.

248
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,300
What's wrong here?

249
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,540
Her blood pressure is suddenly dropping.

250
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,780
We can't stop the bleeding.

251
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,619
Notify the director now!

252
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,020
Give me more pads.

253
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,270
This is the OR. Please call the director.

254
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,219
More pads now!

255
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,540
More pads. And hurry.

256
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,619
What's going on?

257
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,019
Well, there was bleeding all of a sudden.

258
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,779
I must have ruined everything.

259
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,990
Step aside.

260
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:32,580
Why are her veins so ugly?

261
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:38,219
Hook her up with more blood.

262
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:39,659
We ran out of blood.

263
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,419
Then go and get more.

264
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,540
Yes, doctor.

265
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,510
Authorized Personnel Only

266
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,419
Surgery Waiting Room

267
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:58,580
Han Su Ryeon

268
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:05,219
Open it up more.

269
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,340
Clamp.

270
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,780
Open it up more.

271
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,270
Okay. What was that?

272
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
Close her up.

273
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:33,020
The surgery is over. Stitch her up.

274
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,580
Dr. Gong. I need to talk to you.

275
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,340
Have a drink.

276
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,459
I'm all right.

277
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:13,820
Drink it.

278
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:17,379
Okay.

279
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,780
It was the side effect of the anaesthesia.

280
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,459
Right.

281
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,179
It was an unfortunate event that could've happened to anyone.

282
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:40,749
Chief Gong, brush off what happened today...

283
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,899
and focus on the surgeries you have tomorrow.

284
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,899
You get what I'm saying, right?

285
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,419
Yes, Director Ahn.

286
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:56,459
Drink up.

287
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:02,219
Operation Room

288
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:04,419
Authorized Personnel Only

289
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,020
Su Ryeon.

290
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,060
My gosh. Su Ryeon...

291
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:14,138
Su Ryeon's surgery was successful.

292
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:15,219
Thank you.

293
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,419
When she wakes up in the recovery room,

294
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:21,259
she'll be moved to the general ward.

295
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,820
- Thank you so much, doctor. - My pleasure.

296
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,739
Even while seeing the man protest for over a year,

297
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,340
you remained silent.

298
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,899
Even though you knew everything.

299
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,020
As if speaking up would change anything.

300
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:14,699
Do you know...

301
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,540
what happened to my mentor after he blew the whistle?

302
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:21,659
He was fired.

303
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,779
No one's willing to take him in...

304
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,659
now that he has been black-listed.

305
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,419
So how could I take a stand?

306
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,020
I'll only end up the same way.

307
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,820
I'm better off doing as asked.

308
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,060
That's your problem.

309
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,580
You think doing as asked frees you from the guilt.

310
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,020
Because you lack power, because there's nothing you can do,

311
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:51,340
and because it wouldn't work anyway.

312
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:53,419
That's why you chose to side with evil.

313
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,340
Because it wasn't going to happen to you anyway.

314
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,779
That attitude of yours...

315
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,659
made people like Ahn Young Sook spread their wings.

316
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,740
You're also an accomplice.

317
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,379
Authorized Personnel Only

318
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,459
I'm sorry, Director Ahn.

319
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,459
Some punk...

320
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,339
Some punk smashed my car.

321
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,899
Did you catch the punk?

322
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
No.

323
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:49,378
Chief Gong hasn't called yet, has he?

324
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:51,418
His phone has been turned off.

325
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,138
I'm going with a new medical supply dealer,

326
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,339
so draw up a list.

327
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,618
What about Meditopia, then?

328
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:59,100
Switch companies, darn it.

329
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,218
Of course. What about the rest of the payment?

330
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:03,419
Do not pay a single dime.

331
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:09,699
And cancel the rest of the booked surgeries.

332
00:25:14,219 --> 00:25:15,740
This patient should not eat.

333
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,899
I bet this fake patient wouldn't even be here.

334
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:25,899
Health Care

335
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,659
I see you're still here.

336
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:30,980
Where else should a patient be?

337
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,379
I see.

338
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:37,819
By the way, haven't we met before?

339
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,698
Haven't you seen me before? I've seen you around, you know.

340
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:41,740
Right?

341
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:44,459
Where did we meet though?

342
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:46,939
I don't quite remember.

343
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:48,499
I'm disappointed, nurse.

344
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,419
I'm upset and won't speak.

345
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,698
I remember now!

346
00:25:57,699 --> 00:25:59,780
Aren't you the taxi driver?

347
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,539
We already confirmed where the crimes are taking place.

348
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,300
Is there a need to stay?

349
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,260
There's a piece of the puzzle that I can't quite place.

350
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:20,820
Director Ahn is goal-oriented,

351
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:24,219
and she keeps her intentions close to the vest.

352
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,899
She values surgeries more than anything else,

353
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,179
but she let her drinking problem give her hand tremors...

354
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,820
and now she's spending a lot of her time...

355
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,340
doing volunteer work.

356
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,219
It doesn't make any sense.

357
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,300
That's why you've been carrying around that frown.

358
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,979
Maybe it's what she likes to do...

359
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
or maybe she's looking for fame.

360
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:47,219
Do Gi, is that you?

361
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:49,939
Do Gi.

362
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:54,980
Were you injured?

363
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:57,300
Well, I'm almost back to full health.

364
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
What brings you by though?

365
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:03,499
I came by to visit a friend and was on my way out.

366
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,980
Does Mr. Park and Mr. Choi also know you're here?

367
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:07,739
I'll be discharged soon.

368
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,858
Do Gi, please. You should rest while admitted to a hospital.

369
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:12,740
You don't want complications later on.

370
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,939
I appreciate your concern.

371
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,619
By the way, how did it go with that friend of yours?

372
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
My friend?

373
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:27,219
Oh, right. The one I was on the fence about befriending.

374
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,619
I think you're right.

375
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:38,020
He's someone I can't be friends with.

376
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,698
I need to get going to pick up a passenger.

377
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,619
Get well soon, Do Gi. I'll see you at work.

378
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,060
Sure.

379
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,099
Isn't Mr. On sweet?

380
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,780
He was here to visit a sick friend.

381
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:03,859
Visiting a sick person.

382
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,619
That's it.

383
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,419
What?

384
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,500
People come by to visit sick family members and friends.

385
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:13,300
That's right.

386
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:14,980
Don't you find it weird?

387
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,179
Surgeries are conducted as if this is a factory...

388
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,698
Intensive Care Unit

389
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,699
Surgery Waiting Room

390
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:27,899
So why isn't there anyone in the waiting room?

391
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,219
It is odd now that you mention it.

392
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:34,740
Normally, someone waits until the surgery is over.

393
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,459
Like Ms. Han's father,

394
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,619
at least one person always waits.

395
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,740
I think I know why.

396
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:45,699
Recipient of Basic Health Care

397
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,179
Sir, let me take a look.

398
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,820
How does this feel?

399
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:51,499
It's a little numb.

400
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,379
Can you move your toes for me?

401
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,580
Goodness.

402
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:57,658
You're lucky that I caught this early.

403
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,580
It could've turned into something serious.

404
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:02,819
But I don't feel any kind of discomfort.

405
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,260
Is surgery necessary?

406
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,780
Gosh, I'm sorry.

407
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:11,260
As if I know any better.

408
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,020
All right. Let me schedule your surgery.

409
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,979
Before your condition worsens,

410
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,980
I will operate on you and make you as good as new.

411
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,019
I booked four more surgeries,

412
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,459
so prep operating room two.

413
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,020
Why? Isn't it possible?

414
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:29,939
Call the work manager and sort out the operating rooms.

415
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:32,418
What do you mean it can't be done...

416
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:33,739
when I have these many surgeries?

417
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,979
Get a grip on yourself.

418
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,819
She's booking surgeries for the elderly...

419
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,619
who don't need to be operated.

420
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:41,779
This was how she was able to conduct so many surgeries.

421
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,419
How many times must I tell you?

422
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:46,259
My gosh. Shall we move on?

423
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,300
- Sure. - Good.

424
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:51,459
The elderly she approached are recipients of basic health care.

425
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:53,618
How are you feeling these days?

426
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:54,938
- I'm good. - Good.

427
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:56,458
She's taking advantage of the fact that...

428
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,980
the cost is covered by the government.

429
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,698
Director Ahn just puts in the claim once the surgeries are over.

430
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,259
I know that one can be crazy about money,

431
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,378
but how could she do this to those who are healthy?

432
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:08,619
How was she never caught after doing this to people?

433
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,218
Their families would've said something.

434
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:13,139
That brings me to the second reason...

435
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,379
why no one was in the waiting room.

436
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,179
I have no family. But you still fixed me up...

437
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,340
for free.

438
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,899
She targeted senior citizens who have no family.

439
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:27,899
Then...

440
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:33,300
even if the surgeries don't go well...

441
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,060
Ahn Young Sook is the offender but also their guardian.

442
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:41,419
It's how she gets her own way without being questioned.

443
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,659
She took advantage of the loophole in the law...

444
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:47,699
and designed the perfect crime.

445
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,019
- Right. - What?

446
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,419
Why on earth are we doing this?

447
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,540
It's a birthday gift.

448
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:04,980
I heard you and your dad promised to go here together.

449
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,219
He told me.

450
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:57,340
I heard...

451
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,580
that you were still paying her medical bills.

452
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,699
I don't know how to thank you.

453
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,699
Thank you so much.

454
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:07,780
Don't mention it.

455
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:11,500
It's a loan, and I expect the money back.

456
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:15,580
Of course. I'll repay you in any way I can.

457
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,459
We'll handle getting the payment back,

458
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,060
so you don't need to be concerned.

459
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:24,419
Sorry?

460
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:26,659
She's a strong one.

461
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:29,820
I think she gets that from you.

462
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:42,020
Darn it. Is that the best I can do?

463
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,339
Mr. Kim has been gushing over...

464
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,100
his clever new employee.

465
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,619
Thank you, Director.

466
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,260
How many surgeries have you conducted?

467
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,179
Surgeries?

468
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:03,939
None.

469
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,379
Do you know Chief Gong at Meditopia?

470
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,418
Yes, I heard about him.

471
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:10,219
I trained him, you know.

472
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,500
But right now, he's on his way out.

473
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:20,020
You can find surgery kits online to practice with.

474
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:22,779
They don't cost much, so get practicing.

475
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,299
After a few tries, you'll get the hang of it.

476
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,580
Are you not interested?

477
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,258
If so, tell me right now...

478
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:31,819
so that I can contact another supplier.

479
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,219
Gosh, no. I'll get practicing.

480
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,619
Okay.

481
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,019
Issue yourself a company credit card...

482
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,429
and hand it to the hospital administrator.

483
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:46,779
Got it, Director Ahn.

484
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:49,299
- Get going, then. - Take care.

485
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,580
Why are my shots so bad today?

486
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:05,739
Good shot.

487
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:10,429
It's me.

488
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,179
He's on board.

489
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,658
- She... - He'll get you the credit card.

490
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:17,868
She just hired someone to do her surgeries, didn't she?

491
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:20,909
That was easier than getting a local part-time job.

492
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:24,299
Jin Eon, did you see that?

493
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:27,540
- See what? - That swing of mine.

494
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,219
I have finally found my calling.

495
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:37,779
He's unconscious?

496
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:40,179
Unbelievable.

497
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,580
Gyeong Gu, she's leaving.

498
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:52,540
Fine.

499
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:59,020
Sir, can you hear me?

500
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,259
Let's take a look.

501
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:11,429
All right.

502
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,619
Hello.

503
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:20,020
Old age is causing this, so keep taking good care of him.

504
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,539
His vital signs are getting weaker,

505
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,020
and I can't get an IV in.

506
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,739
- So? - Sorry?

507
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,218
I just said that old age was causing this.

508
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:31,460
Are you trying to contradict me?

509
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:34,258
Can you take responsibility for it?

510
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,429
Of course not, Director.

511
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:43,258
Yes, Director?

512
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:46,818
When the patient dies, call the police in the afternoon...

513
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:48,778
and report that an elder who lives alone...

514
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:50,299
died of chronic disease.

515
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,500
Yes, Director.

516
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,908
Once the death certificate is issued,

517
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:57,540
arrange a funeral with the borough office welfare division.

518
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:01,020
Also, bring me all of the nurse charts.

519
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:02,429
Got it.

520
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:20,339
I can't believe it.

521
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:24,540
How can she be so calm after what she did...

522
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:26,540
to a powerless old man?

523
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,460
A slap on the wrist, a cheap fine,

524
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:31,299
and an easily renewable medical license.

525
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:33,698
Ahn Young Sook discovered that...

526
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:35,219
as Ahn Ji Eun.

527
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:38,500
It's how she came to design this scheme.

528
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:01,389
Medical Record

529
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:10,299
What the...

530
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:13,819
Who's there?

531
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:16,219
Someone's in here.

532
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,429
One should check before turning off the lights.

533
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:29,819
Who are you?

534
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:31,699
Hey?

535
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,259
Only authorized personnel are allowed in here.

536
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,619
You are to leave.

537
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:37,868
And why exactly is this a restricted area?

538
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:38,909
What the...

539
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:40,500
Stop right there.

540
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,020
Who are you anyway?

541
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,389
Help!

542
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:57,739
Don't come near me, you freak!

543
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,060
Kim

544
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,540
Yes?

545
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,020
I wish to make the sweet Director Ahn Young Sook...

546
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:13,819
famous.

547
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,299
Do you need help?

548
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:18,020
The more, the merrier.

549
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:19,779
I'll be right over.

550
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,909
One might think you own this hospital.

551
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:37,429
- Stick to picking up the trash. - What?

552
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,540
Gosh, here's a fake patient.

553
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:50,060
Monthly Law

554
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,338
My IV drip is done.

555
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:56,739
I'll take it out for you in your room.

556
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,699
Nurse Treatment Room

557
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:13,819
Pharmacy

558
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,219
Shouldn't this be locked?

559
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,540
Restricted Visitation

560
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,699
You can't come this way.

561
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:35,020
Until when?

562
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:39,179
This is an urgent matter, so come back some other time.

563
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Sure.

564
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:50,819
Hang in there, sir. We'll get you to another hospital.

565
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,429
I'm all done.

566
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,299
Don't you think I look good in this gown?

567
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:09,019
I blend in, don't I?

568
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,339
- Quiet. This way. - Right.

569
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:16,219
I hope Director Ahn...

570
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:19,219
loves this special day of hers.

571
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,179
She will since it'll make her more famous.

572
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,429
- Nurse. - Yes?

573
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:28,939
I'm all better now and want to be discharged.

574
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,659
You're better? Just like that?

575
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:35,060
Yes, I suddenly feel fine.

576
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,299
Have a good day, then.

577
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,818
Schweitzer of Shanty Towns

578
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:49,020
Hello.

579
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,218
- What's your name? - I'm a fan.

580
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:54,579
Gosh, thank you. What's your name?

581
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,539
- It's Son Young Min. - I see.

582
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,428
- Have a good day. - Thank you.

583
00:41:58,429 --> 00:41:59,779
Schweitzer of Shanty Towns, Author Book Signing Event

584
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,139
Hello.

585
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,219
Ahn Young Sook

586
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,020
Can I take a photo?

587
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,388
- Like this? - Yes.

588
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:08,429
Ahn Young Sook, be healthy

589
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,738
- It's an honour. - Gosh, thank you.

590
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:12,540
- Have a good day. - Thank you.

591
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,100
- Hello. - It's an honour.

592
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:24,100
Director Ahn, your book just came out.

593
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:26,619
That's right. Gosh, it's embarrassing.

594
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:28,980
I'm in love with the title.

595
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,909
"Schweitzer of Shanty Towns."

596
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:32,429
Can you tell us about it?

597
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,658
Well, my experience...

598
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:36,428
as a doctor...

599
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:37,500
Just a moment, please.

600
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,218
Before you start,

601
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:42,869
we just have to share some news.

602
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,019
We received a tip about you not long ago.

603
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,020
Ahn Young Sook, Orthopedist

604
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:51,428
I don't know what you're talking about.

605
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:54,659
You don't have to be so humble about something like this.

606
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,868
You promised to donate this year's profits...

607
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:00,059
for the welfare and health...

608
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,699
of all the elderly who live alone.

609
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:05,339
Who, me?

610
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:16,428
We called a member of your staff to confirm this,

611
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:18,908
and he said he knew nothing of it...

612
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:21,819
until he received the pledge certificate.

613
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:24,818
Who else can we call the Korean Schweitzer?

614
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:26,429
She deserves more applause.

615
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:31,299
Thank you.

616
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,259
Thank you.

617
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:38,939
Hey, Mr. Kim.

618
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,979
I can't reach the admin office right now.

619
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,619
Ahn Young Sook

620
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:46,859
Did you approve a donation in my name?

621
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,778
Yes, I wired this year's profits...

622
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:50,819
to the Blue Bird Foundation for the Elderly.

623
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:57,379
You're saying my actual signature was on it?

624
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,619
I never signed such a thing.

625
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,259
Hello.

626
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:05,459
I'm a huge fan.

627
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,020
Thank you.

628
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:10,738
Thank you.

629
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:13,139
Ahn Young Sook

630
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,900
I got it.

631
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:16,619
Thank you.

632
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:20,419
Are you insane? What is it you do?

633
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,818
Why did you do such a sloppy job?

634
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:24,979
Is your skull full of trash?

635
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,419
It was your signature,

636
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,659
and you're all for treating the elderly.

637
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,380
And the TV station kept calling to ask, so...

638
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,060
Can you get the money back?

639
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,580
If we ask for it back, can we get a refund?

640
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,420
Donations made by legal means can't be retrieved, I heard.

641
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,739
And everyone's saying...

642
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,618
you're a real Schweitzer to help people in secret...

643
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,419
Will you stop talking such nonsense?

644
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,900
When the admin manager comes in, tell him to call me, okay?

645
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,299
- Okay? - Yes.

646
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,659
What a rotten day.

647
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,060
What is it now?

648
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:11,619
Okay.

649
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:12,619
The Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service

650
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,619
It's that way.

651
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,219
Send Ahn Young Sook to prison!

652
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:24,860
Parking, Staff Only

653
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,580
What?

654
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,060
There must be a reason they're assessing us.

655
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:38,339
The Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service

656
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,860
May I ask what's going on?

657
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,979
I'm the director of this hospital.

658
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,619
I'm with HIRA's joint task force team.

659
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,420
Someone reported you reuse disposable syringes.

660
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,020
- We reuse syringes? - Yes.

661
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,218
You must be mistaken.

662
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:11,818
We don't do such a thing.

663
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,499
They don't cost much anyway.

664
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,580
I found them.

665
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,940
Who would pull a prank like this in a hospital?

666
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,500
These people are getting the wrong idea.

667
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,980
Who is it? Who set this up?

668
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:38,779
Where do you keep the psychotropic medication?

669
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:41,139
I heard you smuggle them out too.

670
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,779
What on earth are you talking about?

671
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,580
Psychotropic medication

672
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,139
Who took what was in here?

673
00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:02,699
Get the log!

674
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:06,539
We checked the log online.

675
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,219
You made constant and regular prescriptions.

676
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:12,179
I did?

677
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,020
You're saying I took what was in here?

678
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,420
There's medication that expired a year ago?

679
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,460
My gosh.

680
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:23,380
You're a full package, aren't you?

681
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,060
Unbelievable.

682
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,219
This is a conspiracy.

683
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:30,420
Someone faked it all.

684
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:35,219
Someone set it all up to frame me.

685
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:37,939
Check the security cameras.

686
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,380
It'll show who was in here.

687
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:44,020
Let's check the footage so we can catch the person.

688
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,659
What? It was formatted?

689
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:52,419
Yes. Our system...

690
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,739
is regularly formatted.

691
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,060
It was last formatted at midnight.

692
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:02,020
What idiot set up that kind of system?

693
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,619
You did.

694
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,940
You wanted it to be formatted every two weeks...

695
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,219
so it can't be restored.

696
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,218
There's nothing more to see.

697
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:15,618
Darn you. Why won't you believe me?

698
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:17,698
So what if you're a civil servant?

699
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:20,579
How many times must I say this is all fake?

700
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,818
Who are you? Who do you work for?

701
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,019
Who are you working with?

702
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,658
- Who did you gang up with? - Let him go.

703
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:27,698
Let go!

704
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:29,540
Do you know Meditopia's Gong Soo Ho?

705
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,259
He turned himself in last night.

706
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:43,020
Deluxe

707
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,619
Can I help you?

708
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:56,020
I'm here to turn myself in.

709
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,778
Jeil Chakhan Hospital's director Ahn Young Sook...

710
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:08,619
had a medical appliance company's employee operate in her place.

711
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:12,459
Once it was revealed she'd hired others to operate,

712
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,019
the judge of Han Su Ryeon's medical malpractice suit...

713
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,379
allowed a retrial against Ahn.

714
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,419
Court allows retrial

715
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,539
Business at Jeil Chakhan Hospital was suspended,

716
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,499
and it's said they're taking measures to close down.

717
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,579
Proxy surgery

718
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,059
Han Su Ryeon, a victim of the proxy surgery...

719
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,738
is undergoing treatment at another hospital.

720
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:32,059
Tell the truth behind your lies and manipulation!

721
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,380
Send Ahn Young Sook to prison!

722
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,940
Trauma: Does It Occur Externally or Internally

723
00:51:09,779 --> 00:51:11,020
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

724
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:14,100
Administrative Disposition Notice

725
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:31,979
Board License

726
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,860
I'll pay the fine and change my name.

727
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,939
And start a new hospital.

728
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,060
They act like they're so great when they'll forget about it soon.

729
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,059
They're such morons.

730
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,139
Doctor's License

731
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:47,860
I'm much smarter.

732
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,139
Darn it.

733
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:23,619
Once this surgery factory closes down,

734
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:25,139
what would you do?

735
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,020
Who are you?

736
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,019
Would you repent for what you did,

737
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,139
or would you prepare for another name change?

738
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,900
If it's the latter, that makes you incurable.

739
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,739
My goodness.

740
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,580
The fake patient?

741
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,779
Don't worry. Your incurable disease...

742
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,900
is exactly something I can operate on.

743
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,420
Did you do all this?

744
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:09,060
Did the likes of you do this to me?

745
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,500
You have a death wish, don't you?

746
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:26,819
There was a faint smell of garlic when I drifted off.

747
00:53:28,299 --> 00:53:32,139
You, fake patient. Why are you doing this?

748
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,940
One time, my army base's ssireum arena...

749
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:46,860
got some new sand.

750
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:52,219
Clean, fresh sand has no impurities. So it's fine, soft,

751
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,619
and feels great on bare feet.

752
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,138
One of the soldiers...

753
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:00,619
was sewing his uniform in the arena...

754
00:54:01,819 --> 00:54:03,299
and he dropped the needle.

755
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:08,299
Do you know what happened then?

756
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,219
No one was able to set foot in the arena.

757
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,420
The large ring full of clean sand...

758
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:20,980
had become a dangerous place because of one needle.

759
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,139
Because of just one needle.

760
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:27,139
Because of you.

761
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,658
Operation Room

762
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:34,659
Operating Room Status: Ahn Young Sook, Awaiting surgery

763
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,739
In surgery

764
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,339
How does it feel to be on the table?

765
00:54:42,819 --> 00:54:46,739
I'll make you vice director.

766
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:50,019
I wasn't on this table for long,

767
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,659
but so many thoughts went through my mind then.

768
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:54,940
If I were one of your actual patients,

769
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:57,619
what could I have done as I lay here?

770
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,860
It was to trust you.

771
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:06,020
The profits. You can take 60 percent.

772
00:55:07,259 --> 00:55:09,219
I'll take 40.

773
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,698
While you had someone else operate,

774
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:13,060
while you were drinking,

775
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:16,980
the only thing I could do on the operating table...

776
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,060
was to trust you with my whole being.

777
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,259
Han Su Ryeon did that,

778
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,819
and so did her father.

779
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:30,819
You take 60, I'll take 40.

780
00:55:31,819 --> 00:55:32,860
No.

781
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:34,860
You can keep it all.

782
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,139
You 70, me 30!

783
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:39,179
Let me live.

784
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,540
Please, let me live!

785
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,580
When did you get here?

786
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,420
What's that?

787
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:56,819
The fish-shaped buns.

788
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,540
No way. This looks so good.

789
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,420
I'm scared of getting the surgery.

790
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:20,698
Once I get my driver's license,

791
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:22,939
we can go to the east coast just like old times...

792
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,619
and go to the silver grass field. What do you think?

793
00:56:25,659 --> 00:56:27,659
Just the thought of it makes me happy.

794
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:04,860
Su Ryeon.

795
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,100
Su Ryeon.

796
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,420
It's Dad.

797
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,460
Do you recognize me? I'm right here.

798
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:20,420
Dad.

799
00:57:22,299 --> 00:57:23,299
Yes.

800
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:26,420
I dreamed I walked through the silver grass.

801
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,020
With you.

802
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:30,860
Yes.

803
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:34,179
Thank you so much.

804
00:57:34,779 --> 00:57:36,339
Thank you.

805
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:40,980
You did well. Good for you.

806
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,259
Doctor! My daughter, she's awake.

807
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,860
Rainbow Transport

808
00:57:55,219 --> 00:57:57,139
I'll send a photo. Go ahead with it.

809
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,580
Well, I have it set up,

810
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:04,179
but do you have to go this far?

811
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:06,779
I told you.

812
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,420
I'd take care of them in their own way.

813
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:15,020
I know Kim Do Gi the best.

814
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,779
You just do as you're told.

815
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,060
And be careful.

816
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:22,779
I'll be careful.

817
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:29,900
That's not what I meant.

818
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,699
Be careful and make sure it all goes well.

819
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,579
That dirtbag.

820
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,259
Deluxe

821
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,659
I'll take the taxi out of service.

822
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,380
Well done, everyone.

823
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,659
Good job.

824
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,219
Nice one, guys.

825
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,819
No mention of a team dinner today?

826
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,460
Do you want Korean beef?

827
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,299
I wondered why you didn't mention that.

828
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:07,580
Mr. Kim, are things okay on your end?

829
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,219
That's odd.

830
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:20,299
I'm getting a weird noise signal from the taxi.

831
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,779
A noise signal?

832
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:32,540
Mr. Kim, do you hear me?

833
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:35,060
Go Eun?

834
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,420
Mr. Kim.

835
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:40,619
Do you hear me?

836
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:46,779
Deluxe

837
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,060
Where's he going?

838
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,020
Ahn Go Eun, Choi Gyeong Gu

839
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:37,299
Jang Seong Cheol

840
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,100
President, Jang Seong Cheol

841
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,860
Mr. Kim.

842
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:44,179
Do Gi.

843
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:50,698
Park Jin Eon

844
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:51,699
Ahn Go Eun

845
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,940
Deluxe Taxi

846
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,739
Kim Do Gi

847
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,219
Rainbow Transport

848
01:01:38,219 --> 01:01:40,860
He's someone I can't be friends with.

849
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,619
I need to get going to pick up a passenger.

850
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,380
Sure.

851
01:01:58,819 --> 01:02:02,619
Deluxe Taxi

852
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,219
Deluxe

853
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:28,339
Deluxe, M5283

854
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:32,339
Taxi Driver 2

855
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,539
Because you lack power, because there's nothing you can do,

856
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,899
that's why you choose to side with evil.

857
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,420
That makes you an accomplice.

858
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,779
No way. Kim Do Gi's dead?

859
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,899
Won't they do something?

860
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,779
Someone dislikes us a great deal.

861
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,499
I identified the unfamiliar people who came to...

862
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,618
Mr. Kim's funeral.

863
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:24,659
They all work here.

864
01:03:24,779 --> 01:03:27,019
Black Sun? The famous Gangnam club?

865
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,658
Why would a club go after Mr. Kim?

866
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:30,139
Should I kill one more?

867
01:03:30,219 --> 01:03:31,698
Live a long life.

868
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:33,138
Don't work too hard.

869
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:36,579
Are you saying Mr. On tried to kill Mr. Kim?

870
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,299
He approached us with an ulterior motive.

871
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,900
I'm glad we didn't become friends.

872
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,020
I think it's time to make a move.
