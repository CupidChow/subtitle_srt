00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:31,932
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,632
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,034
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:38,073

00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,403
Episode 13

10
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:42,974
I bet you didn't expect such a worn-out office.

11
00:00:43,103 --> 00:00:44,313
That's not it.

12
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:48,084
I was admiring the vibe that I've obviously missed.

13
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:49,213
Is that so?

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,684
The one who raised me as a kid...

15
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,254
had a place with a similar mood.

16
00:00:58,393 --> 00:00:59,522
June 29, 2022: Taxi license

17
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,992
You applied for the job not long after acquiring your license.

18
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,963
That's right. I didn't even hesitate.

19
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:08,433
If I'm not stepping over any boundaries,

20
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,704
may I ask why you applied for a job at our office?

21
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:14,944
Well...

22
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:18,573
From a tender age, I grew up in a facility.

23
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:21,444
I spent a lot of time alone...

24
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,982
which made me wish for people to seek me out.

25
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:27,012
On Ha Jun

26
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:29,724
Taxi drivers are those whom people seek out,

27
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:32,924
although we part ways when we arrive at their destination.

28
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:36,724
You're not wrong, I guess.

29
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:41,504
I don't know if our destinations will sync up,

30
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:46,034
but let's enjoy each other's company while we work together.

31
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:50,944
Thank you. I'll do my best.

President, Jang Seong Cheol

35
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:02,054
Do you remember the time I caused an accident?

36
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:05,724
You didn't scold me but comforted me instead.

37
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:07,153
It was nice.

38
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:10,694
You were the first person who was genuinely nice to me...

39
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:12,934
in my entire life.

40
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,133
I hope you live a long life.

41
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:23,103
Don't work too much.

00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,133
Yes, good afternoon.

45
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:51,733
I'd like to check the Hi-pass payment log.

Victor

49
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,264
Here's the organization chart I've put together so far.

50
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:23,763
The so-called owners are just figureheads,

51
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,293
and the true owner remains hidden.

52
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,193
From what I have gathered at Black Sun,

53
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,664
this man is currently in charge.

54
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:30,834
I have something to add.

55
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,673
Sergeant Jang Jin Ho, Senior Officer Jo Min Geon

56
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:38,113
Hold on. Isn't he the prick from Cotaya?

57
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:40,913
- I mean, the captain. - That's right.

58
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,513
Just so you know, where he worked the longest...

59
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:46,753
prior to Black Sun was Jeongsam Police Station.

60
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:48,884
And the three of them were on the same team.

61
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:50,723
Could it be a coincidence?

62
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:54,193
If it were a coincidence, it'd be highly unpleasant.

63
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:00,094
Sergeant Jang Jin Ho, Senior Officer Jo Min Geon

64
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,074
That unpleasant coincidence Mr. Jang mentioned...

65
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:12,714
might not be a coincidence after all.

66
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,283
Someone created...

67
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,683
a camera blind spot at Jeongsam Police Station.

68
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,284
What's fishy about that?

69
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:23,954
Because police stations make sure there aren't any...

70
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:27,353
to protect the officers and also the victims' rights.

71
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:30,862
But out of nine cameras at that station,

72
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,894
three aren't operational.

73
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:33,993
They're fake cameras.

74
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:38,003
It must be easier this way.

75
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:40,134
To do what?

76
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,943
I doubt it's to protect the victims' rights.

77
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,144
So where do we go from here?

78
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:49,543
We need to find the recording device...

79
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:51,483
that Journalist Kim gave to Detective Choi.

80
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,113
It'd be nice to have footage to go with it.

81
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:56,183
What if we found the true owner in the process?

82
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,693
Gosh. That'd be the cherry on top.

83
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:07,134
Deluxe

84
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:14,204

85
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:16,474
Black Sun, Guard Jang

86
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,373
Where are you, you punk?

87
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:24,853
I was hungry,

88
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:26,784
so I went out for a bite to eat.

89
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:30,423
You thought you had time to do that?

90
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:32,954
Get back here this instant.

91
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:35,193
I'll be right there, boss.

92
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:42,433
If you show up there right now,

93
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,063
you'll suffer a beating.

94
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,344
Would he rough me up when I barely know anything?

95
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,384
What could be simpler than making a delivery?

96
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:04,423
You...

97
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:08,123
What's the point of punching someone clueless?

98
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,264
And you actually went out to grab a bite.

99
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:15,363
You should be setting an example for the newbie.

100
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,404
Stay alert, will you?

101
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,933
Hey, you.

102
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:21,704
An outraged VIP guest called.

103
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,274
The beginning and end of Black Sun, you say?

104
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:25,873
Is that the best you could do?

105
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:27,673
Don't you dare swing that bottle.

106
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:31,414
Don't be such a wuss. This is for massages.

107
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,213
I heard that our doll...

108
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:36,353
was delivered to a hospital and not a hotel.

109
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,654
Which one of you suddenly had a pang of guilt?

110
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,534
That trash journalist snatched her up.

111
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,074
I bet you're embarrassed to say it yourself.

112
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:53,303
That is why...

113
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:56,873
the commission will double starting tomorrow.

114
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,043
What?

115
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,274
My boys clearly need motivation.

116
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:02,844
Why else do you think something this embarrassing happened?

117
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:04,312
You must be out of your mind.

118
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:05,714
Yes, I am.

119
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:07,654
Since that's the case, maybe I should quadruple it.

120
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,024
As if you'll actually share the dough.

121
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:14,423
I know you'll pocket it all.

122
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:17,094
Why that little...

123
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:22,303
Yes, Chief.

124
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:26,303
Right. I'll have it ready for you in the office.

125
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:27,974
Sure.

126
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,613
Give me some paper.

127
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:41,114
Write down when you left with the doll...

128
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,124
and when that journalist kicked your butts.

129
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:45,423
I want a detailed timeline.

130
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:47,323
Right now!

131
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:48,764
You morons.

132
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:58,433
I don't see anything that's worth blocking the door for.

It doesn't seem like part of the club for sure.

137
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:32,254
No wonder Journalist Kim never located this place.

138
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:42,134
Didn't you find it odd, though?

142
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:10,393

145
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:18,933
He wanted a detailed report broken down in minutes.

Loading

155
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,063
Done.

156
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:30,633
Black Sun CCTV footage

157
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:31,664
What are these?

158
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:34,633
I rummaged through the hard drive at Black Sun,

159
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:38,004
but nothing was on it except for these CCTV files.

160
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:39,773
Check out the file names.

161
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:42,182
Jang Ga Young, Yoo Jin Young, and Kim Hee Young.

162
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:43,414
They are names of women.

163
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,614
You're right.

164
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,553
The name of the file must correspond with the woman in the footage.

165
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,793
But all the footage seems similar to me.

166
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:58,664
It's the same with all the other files.

167
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,562
They're seen leaving the club,

168
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:03,234
taking the elevator, and entering the hotel room.

169
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:04,734
That's all there is to it.

170
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:08,134
That must be all the footage they needed.

171
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,644
It almost seems like evidence of some sort.

172
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:16,244
Are there men in any of the footage?

173
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,053
Only one.

174
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:21,553
Is it Detective Choi Seong Eun?

175
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:23,784
Bingo.

176
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:44,104
Mr. Jang, you were right about this being evidence.

177
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,673
But it's only one short video.

178
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:47,514
This was the evidence...

179
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:50,144
that led to Detective Choi's death being ruled as suicide.

180
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,313
All the other video files...

181
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:55,053
must've been collected to change the outcome of something.

182
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,524
I doubt it was for something good.

183
00:15:58,654 --> 00:15:59,723
That reminds me.

184
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:01,894
What's that?

185
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:04,222
It's the same model as the recording device...

186
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:05,793
Journalist Kim gave to Detective Choi.

187
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,562
The footage was blurry.

188
00:16:08,563 --> 00:16:10,563
But that has to be it since there isn't another model.

189
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,604
MD Windy

190
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:22,884
- Howdy. - Hello?

191
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:24,543
Where are you?

192
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:25,813
What are you up to?

193
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:29,784
I was out having fun before my shift started.

194
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:34,624
You see, I had a favour to ask.

195
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:38,024
A favour?

196
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:42,234
What kind of favour?

197
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:52,114
Nice shot.

198
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,243
Camera

199
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:57,514
You're quite good for someone who's bad at this.

200
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:00,553
I mean that you're trying hard.

201
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:03,823
I've been coming by often to practice.

202
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,453
So what was this favour you wanted?

203
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:09,523
Are you and Victor close?

204
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,633
The recent botched delivery...

205
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,304
was for Victor.

206
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:18,733
He's still furious about it.

207
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,874
I was hoping to cheer him up when he comes in later.

208
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,942
I'm afraid our relationship doesn't extend that far.

209
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:28,144
I'm not saying you should get all cute.

210
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:31,953
Just take the hit for me when he throws a fit.

211
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,253
It will be bad for business if I get injured.

212
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,453
Nothing will happen since you're friends, though.

213
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,463
I hear you.

214
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,104
What...

215
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,634
Was it you?

216
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:54,904
You should've told me.

217
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,673
Maybe you're not actually hurt.

218
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:06,914
Darn it.

219
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,523
I know you said you wanted a job,

220
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,354
but I didn't think you'd get one here.

221
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:15,624
My friend, I know about the unfortunate event.

222
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:16,963
I heard all about it.

223
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:18,933
Why did it have to happen to you?

224
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,604
So how will you make me feel less crappy?

225
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:26,603
Since you know,

226
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:28,743
shouldn't you do something about it?

227
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:32,013
You...

228
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:35,143
You're an employee here as well, you dolt.

229
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:36,344
Number Nine, right?

230
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:40,482
Victor, you're here.

231
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,354
That darn little minx.

232
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:45,693
My friend, I'm terribly sorry about all this.

233
00:18:45,923 --> 00:18:47,094
Let me pour you a glass.

234
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,834
Victor, let's forget about what happened. Okay?

235
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,202
Everything will be on the house today.

236
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:58,333
That's what you said the last time...

237
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:01,203
and left me in bed lonely and alone.

238
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:03,503
All right.

239
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,473
It's time to pick your doll.

240
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,242
Don't you want to score big today?

241
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:10,682
- Open the curtains. - Come on!

242
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,583
Let's pick the doll.

243
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,452
Open the curtains, please.

244
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,753
You know you get on my nerves, right?

245
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:56,923
Good job. You can leave us now.

246
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,394
Hold on.

247
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:05,364
My friend, I want you to handle the delivery this time.

248
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:08,773
You'll be responsible if anything happens to the package.

249
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:09,844
Number Nine.

250
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:16,413
He's not experienced enough, so let me find you someone else.

251
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,282
But someone as experienced as you...

252
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,383
made me sleep alone in my bed.

253
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:24,222
Can't you just shut that mouth of yours?

254
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,453
Stop killing the mood. Just get lost.

255
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,594
Let's talk outside.

256
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:42,844
The leprechaun keeps thinking he can walk all over me.

257
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:46,472
You'll be paid for your service, so ride with the guys...

258
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,884
and call your friend at the end of the process.

259
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:51,884
Don't think about helping, though. Okay?

260
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:55,824
Cat got your tongue?

261
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:57,423
Do you get it?

262
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,223
I'm to call him at the end of the process?

263
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:02,693
That's right.

264
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:15,374
Gosh.

265
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:18,144
Are you kidding me? Did no one train you?

266
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:21,114
- Sorry? - Move to the back.

267
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:25,343
Get behind us, you dimwit.

268
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:27,013
You'll get caught on camera with her.

269
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:48,904
- Let's go. - Sure. Follow us.

270
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:03,054
Mr. Kim.

271
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:05,953
Once again, they're headed to a hotel.

272
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,844
Entrance

273
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:32,584
That again.

274
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,604
I can't tell if she's alert or not.

275
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,634
What's going on?

276
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,253
Should I tell you what would've happened to her...

277
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:16,223
had I not interrupted?

278
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:19,762
She would've been taken to someplace...

279
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,634
only to be gruesomely violated.

280
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:24,834
- What are you doing? - Pardon?

281
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,134
- Get out. - Okay.

282
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,013
What?

283
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:41,554
Is watching her in there getting your blood going?

284
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:45,483
Call your friend.

285
00:23:47,023 --> 00:23:49,223
Tell him we made the delivery to Room 1018.

286
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:50,664
Yes, sir.

287
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,503
My friend.

288
00:23:57,263 --> 00:24:00,033
The delivery has been made to Room 1018.

289
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:04,443
Good work, my friend. I'm almost there too.

290
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:21,222
I just arrived at the hotel.

291
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:22,462
- So jealous. - You're full of energy.

292
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:23,492
- I settled it with the agent. - Is she pretty?

293
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:24,962
- Why would I get an ugly girl? - You're so greedy.

294
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,492
- You can spend a fortune like him. - Be quiet.

295
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:28,133
Be patient, boys. I'll get a lot of easy girls for you.

296
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,834
- I like them awake. - I prefer them passed out.

297
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:38,644
Goodness. Sirs.

298
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:42,144
My stomach has been hurting for a while.

299
00:24:42,344 --> 00:24:44,313
Can I go use the toilet?

300
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:46,814
Gosh, you little... You should've gone before the drop.

301
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,013
Gosh.

302
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:51,483
- Make it fast. - I'm sorry.

303
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:53,594
I'll be quick. Goodness.

304
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,922
- Be sure to live stream it. - Get a home run tonight.

305
00:24:56,923 --> 00:24:58,323
- Hey, that won't be safe. - What? Are you scared?

306
00:24:58,324 --> 00:24:59,492
- More can solve everything. - I totally agree.

307
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:02,262
The Korean law is so messed up. That's why I love it.

308
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:03,762
- And I love you, Victor. - I'd love to see your live stream.

309
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:05,364
- Don't forget the lights. - Give us some lively photos.

310
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,894
I'll post one after I'm done.

311
00:26:20,943 --> 00:26:22,144
Come on.

312
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:24,544
What is it?

313
00:26:51,773 --> 00:26:53,973
Go Eun, can you take her to the hospital?

314
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:56,013
I'm actually on my way up.

315
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:03,123
Gosh. We're here to collect the laundry.

316
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:05,523
- I'll put it away. It's dangerous. - Here's the laundry on the floor.

317
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,422
- This can be quite dangerous. - Look at this huge job.

318
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:10,324
Our laundry is badly contaminated.

319
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:12,634
- All right. - Oh, my.

320
00:27:12,794 --> 00:27:13,894
There it goes

321
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:16,762
- I wrapped it up nicely. - Okay.

322
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:18,233
Have a good day now.

323
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,673
Here comes the laundry.

324
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,844
I love you.

325
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:49,804
I tell you this from experience.

326
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:54,134
Your clothes must stay clean or others will pick on you.

327
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:57,803
You should have gotten some coffee while you waited.

328
00:27:57,804 --> 00:27:58,844
Why are you out here?

329
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:01,443
Well, I was just looking around.

330
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,483
My staff told me that the orphanage had closed down.

331
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:06,383
A long time had passed since the files were collected,

332
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,084
so most of them were gone.

333
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:11,624
Back then, people didn't think keeping files was important.

334
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:13,653
Together Orphanage

335
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:16,064
Gosh. I'm lucky that you were able to find at least some files.

336
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:19,634
The child was there decades ago.

337
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:23,664
It won't be easy to find him just with his name, On Ha Jun.

338
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:25,564
I should do as much as I can.

339
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:28,433
You must've gone through quite the trouble to find these files.

340
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:30,643
- Thank you. - We should do everything we can...

341
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:33,114
to help none other than the Blue Bird Foundation.

342
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:35,512
Do you happen to know the address...

343
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,814
of the previous orphanage that was destroyed in a fire?

344
00:28:37,914 --> 00:28:40,384
I'll send the address as soon as we find it.

345
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:44,354
The child, On Ha Jun, must be a grown man by now.

346
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:46,223
I hope you find him.

347
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,094
I do too. Thank you.

348
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:51,262
- I'll get going then. - Okay.

349
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,493
- Drive safely. - Thanks.

350
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:56,733
No!

351
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:01,273
Gosh. I almost died!

352
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:07,414
Bummer. That was so close.

353
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:09,943
I could have clawed you up. You know?

354
00:29:10,243 --> 00:29:12,753
I'm sorry, my friend.

355
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:15,282
I'll apologize with my music.

356
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:17,884
No. I'll just go and fulfill my military duty.

357
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:20,423
This is enough now.

358
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,693
What does "a home run" mean?

359
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:24,894
What? A home run?

360
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:29,032
Going all the way with the girl I chose...

361
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,134
would be a home run.

362
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:33,673
But if I couldn't go all the way and had to stop at third base,

363
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:37,344
it would mean it was just a hit. Easy, right?

364
00:29:38,673 --> 00:29:40,713
Don't insult baseball.

365
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:43,814
I answered your question!

366
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:46,414
Don't do that. I'm scared.

367
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,213
Why are you scared?

368
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,783
Just treat it like a game.

369
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:52,522
Let's do it about 100 more times.

370
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:54,192
This isn't a game!

371
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,192
Do you know how dangerous this is?

372
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:59,263
Darn it. Why don't you use that brain of yours and think?

373
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:01,334
Why must I?

374
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:07,673
You picked girls to violate and treated that as a game.

375
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:11,344
Have you ever thought about the fear these girls must have felt...

376
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,074
when you did that?

377
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:16,743
No. That was...

378
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:20,012
Why are you asking me to do something you didn't even do?

379
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:22,213
I was just picking girls.

380
00:30:22,314 --> 00:30:24,554
The agent did everything! Windy.

381
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:26,894
Come on. You saw it too, friend.

382
00:30:28,824 --> 00:30:30,763
You were never my friend.

383
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:34,094
All right. Let's resume.

384
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:36,863
No.

385
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:38,503
My friend.

386
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,232
Don't leave me. Don't do it!

387
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:42,134
Don't do it! Come on!

388
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:44,144
Darn it.

389
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:47,814
Don't do it.

390
00:30:48,574 --> 00:30:50,914
Do Gi. Mr. Do Gi.

391
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,054
My friend!

392
00:30:55,884 --> 00:30:57,054
No!

393
00:30:57,483 --> 00:30:58,683
My friend, don't!

394
00:31:26,814 --> 00:31:27,914
How refreshing.

395
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,453
I used fresh fruit.

396
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,683
I see.

397
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:33,723
Let's go with 100kg.

398
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:38,564
How much?

399
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,133
- A hundred kilograms. - Don't joke now.

400
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:43,032
We joke around when we drink.

401
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,304
This is a business meeting.

402
00:31:45,263 --> 00:31:48,473
The bishop told me to bring in as much as...

403
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,804
you could spare us.

404
00:31:56,884 --> 00:31:57,914
Excuse me.

405
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:03,324
Yes.

406
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:07,094
I hear that...

407
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:09,124
a new police commissioner will be appointed soon.

408
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:10,793
And I've been hearing that...

409
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:12,893
my name is mentioned as a candidate.

410
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:14,262
There are often rumours about the candidates for such positions.

411
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:16,133
- Go on. - Well, I do believe...

412
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,404
I'm their strongest candidate.

413
00:32:19,364 --> 00:32:20,604
But...

414
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:23,344
compared to other candidates,

415
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:25,844
my performance could have been better.

416
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:28,443
I ought to lend a hand with that.

417
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:32,084
Right. You can never be too careful.

418
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:33,814
If possible, it's best to guarantee it.

419
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:36,183
I know that the bishop is looking out for me too.

420
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:40,493
You should start going to the hair salons.

421
00:32:40,894 --> 00:32:42,993
You ought to look dandy during the press conference.

422
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,794
Then I'll count on you.

423
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:47,233
Make sure to...

424
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:53,833
Sorry, ma'am. If I don't answer it, he gets upset.

425
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:54,874
I see.

426
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,973
The bishop wanted me to give you as much as I could spare?

427
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:01,743
That's right.

428
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:04,314
The bishop can freely share such wishes...

429
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:06,614
since the bishop does not work in the field.

430
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:08,713
Things have changed for me.

431
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,653
I don't think I can do 100kg.

432
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,083
Right.

433
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:15,824
Field workers like you must handle such matters carefully.

434
00:33:16,364 --> 00:33:17,594
I need 200kg.

435
00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:19,423
What?

436
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:23,304
I'll secure the storage location and transportation.

437
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,673
Manager On, what makes you so confident you can do this?

438
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:29,904
Enlighten me.

439
00:33:31,003 --> 00:33:34,343
I'll use the safest method to handle it.

440
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:35,644
Don't worry.

441
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,654
If something were to go wrong,

442
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:42,013
I'll take full responsibility as I'm managing it.

443
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:07,773
Young Joon

444
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:11,844
I'm making calls. But I'm not sure she'll say yes.

445
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:15,613
Victor, the owner of this phone...

446
00:34:15,814 --> 00:34:17,653
He's registered as a director of Black Sun.

447
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,794
He's one of the key players.

448
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:22,992
Sung Ji Hyun

449
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:24,024
Young Joon

450
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:25,823
MD Windy

451
00:34:26,694 --> 00:34:30,334
At this rate, there must be victims every night.

452
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,902
Should we get in there and teach everyone a lesson?

453
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:36,072
I agree. Let's round them up right now...

454
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:37,603
rewire their brains!

455
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:40,013
I would love to do that, but that won't be easy.

456
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:41,513
Why not?

457
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:44,743
I want to get all of them and destroy everyone.

458
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:49,683
I haven't found out how deeply this runs at the club.

459
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:51,153
Right.

460
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,123
The figureheads weren't the real owners.

461
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,093
Then this will keep happening.

462
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:56,593
We must stop that.

463
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:58,164
How?

464
00:34:58,564 --> 00:34:59,633
The hierarchy.

465
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,794
Black Sun is strictly based on the hierarchy.

466
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:05,203
Let's take this chance...

467
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:09,104
and give them a real taste of the hierarchy.

468
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,083
- Cheers. - Cheers.

469
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:22,152
Congratulations on your new job.

470
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,822
To celebrate that, this is our treat.

471
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:24,883
Thanks.

472
00:35:25,183 --> 00:35:26,623
By the way, this is my first time here.

473
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,052
The vibe here is so different.

474
00:35:28,053 --> 00:35:29,624
- Isn't the music great? - Right.

475
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:30,894
Who?

476
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:32,763
The one in the yellow outfit?

477
00:35:34,263 --> 00:35:35,294
Okay.

478
00:35:35,863 --> 00:35:38,133
Get me two bottles of the special liquor.

479
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:40,374
Thank you. Have a good day.

480
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:47,214
This must be your first time here.

481
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:49,112
Gosh. How did you know?

482
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,543
Nothing can get past me.

483
00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:51,814
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

484
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:57,683
Since this is your first time at our club, it's on me.

485
00:35:58,153 --> 00:35:59,182
- Gosh. - Nice.

486
00:35:59,183 --> 00:36:01,493
- What's this? - Look. What is it?

487
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:11,532
Why don't we have a glass?

488
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:12,604
Yes.

489
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:15,303
- Empty the first glass. - Okay.

490
00:36:16,104 --> 00:36:18,003
Thank you.

491
00:36:18,004 --> 00:36:19,044
Here.

492
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:21,473
Excuse me.

493
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,444
Yes, Victor. Did you hit a home run last night?

494
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:27,354
Congratulations.

495
00:36:28,113 --> 00:36:29,183
When?

496
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:31,124
How many?

497
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:35,424
Gosh. That many?

498
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:37,964
Everyone with a high pass?

499
00:36:40,234 --> 00:36:41,533
Are you paying for everything?

500
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:45,303
You're so cool.

501
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:52,243
Well...

502
00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:53,914
What is it?

503
00:36:54,314 --> 00:36:55,814
You should get out there.

504
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:57,242
Did someone cause trouble again?

505
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:59,084
- Well... - Darn it.

506
00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:02,113
Those punks.

507
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:04,084
Darn it.

508
00:37:04,854 --> 00:37:06,053
Gosh.

509
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:08,924
Gosh. Sorry.

510
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,223
Wait. You...

511
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:13,132
Hey. What's going on? Who let in these old vendors?

512
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:16,363
Goodness. You should watch where you're going, young man.

513
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,403
Hey. You...

514
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:21,203
Darn it.

515
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:22,572
Can I take it inside?

516
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,702
- Let's go inside. - Come on.

517
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:25,842
Let's go.

518
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,073
- Hey, guys. - You're here.

519
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:30,143
- This is where young kids hang out. - Nice.

520
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:31,282
Rainbow Hiking Club

521
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,383
Victor's VIP

522
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:34,682
Victor's VIP

523
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:35,754
Dancing Hiking Club's 40th Anniversary

524
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,552
- Let's go. - Let's go inside.

525
00:37:39,553 --> 00:37:41,293
- Where is it? Hurry. - Come on.

526
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:42,453
- No. - Let's go.

527
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:44,793
Hey, don't just stand there!

528
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:46,463
Stop them from entering! You jerks!

529
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,492
Stop!

530
00:37:47,493 --> 00:37:49,563
- You can't enter. - Let's go.

531
00:37:49,564 --> 00:37:51,664
- Let's go and have fun. - Oh, my.

532
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:53,472
- Come on. - Let's go.

533
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:54,972
Gosh. What a fancy place.

534
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,773
- This place looks great. - Let's go inside.

535
00:37:57,774 --> 00:37:59,503
No. You're at the wrong place.

536
00:37:59,504 --> 00:38:00,743
This isn't the right club.

537
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:03,073
You're at the wrong club! Stop!

538
00:38:03,243 --> 00:38:04,584
- Go in! - Sir.

539
00:38:06,513 --> 00:38:07,683
This isn't the right club.

540
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:12,524
Well, they all bought high passes. They are VIP customers.

541
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:14,124
High passes?

542
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:15,592
Here we come!

543
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,593
Come on in already. Let's go inside now.

544
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,132
Let's go and have fun.

545
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,632
Come on. We bought high passes!

546
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:26,573
- Let's go inside. - Go!

547
00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:31,674
Victor's VIP

548
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:33,843
Gosh.

549
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,653
Nice!

550
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:42,414
Come here!

551
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,433
Young man, scoot over.

552
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,563
Gosh. You're imposing.

553
00:38:56,564 --> 00:38:57,933
There's a table here.

554
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:00,833
- Gosh. - Come.

555
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,903
Didn't we bring food? Let's see.

556
00:39:03,203 --> 00:39:06,373
Gosh. The music is so loud.

557
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:08,113
- This isn't fun. - I know.

558
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:15,513
Yes!

559
00:39:20,754 --> 00:39:22,024
All right.

560
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:33,734
Nice!

561
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:10,644
Come on. Let's dance.

562
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:22,513
All right, then.

563
00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:30,464
Let's go!

564
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:34,133
Hello, sir.

565
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,734
- Come here. - Over there.

566
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:41,473
What's going on here?

567
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:45,874
These are the VIP customers who bought high passes from Windy.

568
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:48,274
- Have some rice cakes. - Hey, this place is nice.

569
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:56,583
What is this?

570
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:57,953
- What is this nonsense? - Seriously?

571
00:40:58,383 --> 00:41:00,553
- Let's go. - What is this?

572
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:03,663
This is so lame. Let's leave.

573
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:04,794
Close the club tonight.

574
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:07,294
Close it.

575
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:08,933
Yes, sir.

576
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:12,263
Hey, we're done for the night. Close the club now.

577
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,174
Close it now!

578
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:20,874
How could you let this happen?

579
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,314
Well, Victor asked me to do it.

580
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,153
So I thought it was a group of his VIP friends.

581
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:30,152
Did those old people look like VIP friends to you?

582
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:31,952
Cancel all the existing appointments.

583
00:41:31,953 --> 00:41:34,124
- All of them? - News travels fast here.

584
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:35,853
Tell them we're closed for an internal inspection.

585
00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:37,464
Check the reservation system now.

586
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:39,964
And you will compensate for all the loss...

587
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,093
incurred during this break.

588
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:45,064
I don't have that kind of money.

589
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:50,473
Gosh. That jerk, Victor.

590
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:53,773
Tell Victor that I want to see him.

591
00:41:53,774 --> 00:41:56,544
I've been calling him for hours to see him too.

592
00:41:56,883 --> 00:41:57,944
His phone is off.

593
00:41:58,144 --> 00:42:01,084
He must have family or friends. Someone must know him.

594
00:42:01,254 --> 00:42:03,153
If you can't find him, get someone else.

595
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,973
I found out why they kept these video files.

596
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,973
Like you said, these were evidence videos.

597
00:42:25,104 --> 00:42:27,444
- Evidence for what? - Come on. Stop that.

598
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,073
Stop.

599
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:31,883
These victims shared a few things in common.

600
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:35,013
They all lost consciousness at Black Sun.

601
00:42:35,283 --> 00:42:38,723
Then they woke up in a hotel room with a man they'd never met before.

602
00:42:39,754 --> 00:42:41,793
So they told the police that they were sexually assaulted.

603
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:43,254
That was the first thing all the victims did.

604
00:42:43,924 --> 00:42:44,964
What happened next?

605
00:42:45,823 --> 00:42:47,663
Most of their cases were dismissed.

606
00:42:47,664 --> 00:42:49,394
And they were charged with making a false accusation...

607
00:42:50,363 --> 00:42:51,903
because of these videos.

608
00:42:54,334 --> 00:42:56,902
They said they woke up in the hotel after losing consciousness.

609
00:42:56,903 --> 00:42:58,444
But in the videos,

610
00:42:58,874 --> 00:43:00,472
they walked out of the club themselves...

611
00:43:00,473 --> 00:43:02,314
and entered the hotel rooms.

612
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:05,512
To claim that their accusations were false,

613
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:07,213
they kept these clips.

614
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:08,754
Those jerks.

615
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:11,222
That explains their unhesitating behaviour.

616
00:43:11,223 --> 00:43:13,254
They knew they couldn't be charged with anything.

617
00:43:13,653 --> 00:43:16,964
I can't still get over how disgusting these people are.

618
00:43:17,624 --> 00:43:20,092
How could they promote rape as if it's some tour package?

619
00:43:20,093 --> 00:43:21,463
How could anyone do such a thing?

620
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:24,703
I stopped them for now, but they will resume soon.

621
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:28,774
How could they do something like this in the heart of Seoul?

622
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:30,273
Out in the open too.

623
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,302
Victims became the guilty party.

624
00:43:32,303 --> 00:43:34,113
And the guilty party became the victim.

625
00:43:34,944 --> 00:43:37,683
It's like this club is a playground of evil.

626
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:46,553
Who on earth created this monster?

627
00:43:51,323 --> 00:43:53,693
The police arrested a group of people who tried...

628
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:57,234
to launch the largest-scale drug trafficking operation in Korea.

629
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:58,563
They tried to smuggle 230kg...

630
00:43:58,564 --> 00:43:59,733
which would be enough to inject...

631
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:01,032
eight million people at the same time.

632
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:03,202
The drug is estimated to cost around 850 million dollars.

633
00:44:03,203 --> 00:44:05,343
And the police were able to stop the operation.

634
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:07,342
It's the biggest drug bust in Korea.

635
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:09,273
And it's confirmed that an international organization...

636
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:12,743
that has ties to Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong had been a part of it.

637
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:14,983
The organization tried to smuggle the drugs in...

638
00:44:14,984 --> 00:44:17,052
early this morning via a ship coming in...

639
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:18,523
from China and Japan,

640
00:44:18,524 --> 00:44:20,523
but police received word...

641
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,092
and set up a sting operation,

642
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,664
resulting in a huge seizure.

643
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:31,263
Manager On. Why didn't you pick up?

644
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:35,403
Why are you here this early? Did you have breakfast?

645
00:44:36,274 --> 00:44:39,044
Did you see the news? What happened?

646
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,414
Bring in another breakfast set.

647
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:43,174
Do you think I'd feel like eating?

648
00:44:44,544 --> 00:44:46,343
You were so confident.

649
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:49,783
This is why I said we should split the shipments!

650
00:44:50,183 --> 00:44:52,553
Just a moment. Let me watch something first.

651
00:44:52,953 --> 00:44:54,024
Will you watch it too?

652
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:57,592
I wonder if he prepared a nice speech.

653
00:44:57,593 --> 00:44:59,123
The shipment we seized this time...

654
00:44:59,124 --> 00:45:02,694
is on a massive scale, almost twice the size of what...

655
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:05,403
we usually seize in a year.

656
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:09,303
We'll fight the war against drugs even harder,

657
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:12,473
to ensure our country remains drug-free.

658
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:13,944
We'll do our best.

659
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:17,883
We arrested eight members of the gang,

660
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:20,383
- and also... - He got a few facials done.

661
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:23,153
Are you mocking me?

662
00:45:25,453 --> 00:45:28,653
Don't worry, Madam Yang. I'll make it up to you.

663
00:45:31,124 --> 00:45:32,894
How will you do that?

664
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:35,763
They confiscated the goods!

665
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,664
Calm down.

666
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:46,302
Do you remember I won...

667
00:45:46,303 --> 00:45:48,973
the bottle game last time and got a wish?

668
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:53,343
Let me claim that now.

669
00:45:54,453 --> 00:45:57,624
Trust me. Nothing will happen.

670
00:46:10,263 --> 00:46:11,663
You're coming in now?

671
00:46:11,664 --> 00:46:13,104
Hop over here now!

672
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:17,374
Hello, boss.

673
00:46:17,504 --> 00:46:18,504
What time is it?

674
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:23,113
- I'm not late. - There's a training session.

675
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:25,484
A training session?

676
00:46:26,513 --> 00:46:28,283
Run to Room Five now.

677
00:46:28,854 --> 00:46:29,914
Okay.

678
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:31,453
Hey!

679
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,453
Take that with you.

680
00:46:35,624 --> 00:46:36,754
Bye, boss!

681
00:47:06,553 --> 00:47:08,123
Watch out for things like that.

682
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:09,653
Wrap them 2 or 3 times over.

683
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:15,394
You're now truly screwed.

684
00:47:21,504 --> 00:47:23,174
Just answer my questions.

685
00:47:34,513 --> 00:47:35,783
Guys, freeze.

686
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:41,254
What team did I say you were?

687
00:47:42,794 --> 00:47:45,593
The Evidence Destruction Team.

688
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,633
What are you to do with bloody tissues?

689
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:52,734
Put them in the trash bag.

690
00:47:54,903 --> 00:47:55,973
Hey.

691
00:47:56,403 --> 00:47:57,902
I told you several times to split them up...

692
00:47:57,903 --> 00:47:59,504
into different bags for different jurisdictions.

693
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:01,342
That way, they'll go to different police stations...

694
00:48:01,343 --> 00:48:03,743
never to be connected, you morons.

695
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:07,584
That goes for you too.

696
00:48:07,883 --> 00:48:10,923
I told you over ten times to wipe the blood...

697
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:13,223
with this special solution.

698
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:20,633
No. You did well.

699
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,063
I need you to forget like the goldfish you are...

700
00:48:24,064 --> 00:48:26,403
so I can come by and get paid for tutoring you.

701
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:28,433
Keep going.

702
00:48:51,593 --> 00:48:52,624
Go Eun.

703
00:48:53,124 --> 00:48:54,394
Yes, Mr. Kim?

704
00:48:54,794 --> 00:48:58,033
Where did the victims in the videos go to report the club?

705
00:49:02,303 --> 00:49:03,573
Jeongsam Police Station.

706
00:49:03,903 --> 00:49:06,604
They went there because the club's in their jurisdiction.

707
00:49:08,243 --> 00:49:10,174
Which station arrested them for libel?

708
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:11,783
That was...

709
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:16,683
Jeongsam Police Station too.

710
00:49:21,093 --> 00:49:22,394
You wondered...

711
00:49:22,953 --> 00:49:26,723
how this could be possible in the center of Seoul.

712
00:49:28,164 --> 00:49:31,403
That's why Mr. Jang said it looked like an evil playground.

713
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:34,274
Don't you think we're getting a glimpse of...

714
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:36,433
what monster rises in the city center...

715
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,604
when authorities who should be catching evil...

716
00:49:40,174 --> 00:49:41,473
join forces with them?

717
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:46,013
Number Nine.

718
00:49:47,953 --> 00:49:49,084
What's with...

719
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:51,383
the nasty glare?

720
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,553
Follow me. The chief asked for you.

721
00:49:58,194 --> 00:49:59,223
Okay.

722
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,834
- It's us. - Come in.

723
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:11,944
He's here.

724
00:50:18,044 --> 00:50:20,044
- Come and sit. - Go ahead.

725
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:27,024
- You can go. - Okay.

726
00:50:43,234 --> 00:50:44,273
Have a drink.

727
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,973
I'm on the clock.

728
00:50:47,073 --> 00:50:48,613
You can accept what I offer.

729
00:50:50,274 --> 00:50:51,283
Okay, then.

730
00:51:02,124 --> 00:51:03,323
You're a friend of Victor's?

731
00:51:07,263 --> 00:51:09,964
Yes, but we're not that close.

732
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:13,104
Can you get in touch with him?

733
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,573
I've been trying to call him,

734
00:51:17,303 --> 00:51:18,743
but he's ignoring me.

735
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,374
Have another drink and give me the empty glass.

736
00:51:25,314 --> 00:51:26,343
Okay.

737
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:38,424
It's warming you up, isn't it?

738
00:51:39,194 --> 00:51:40,323
It's an expensive liquor.

739
00:51:46,363 --> 00:51:47,734
When did you last see him?

740
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:52,504
Not since I completed the delivery.

741
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:01,314
There's a lot you don't know.

742
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:06,924
Go on. Drink.

743
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,263
Okay.

744
00:52:55,303 --> 00:52:56,374
You must...

745
00:52:57,473 --> 00:52:58,544
know this.

746
00:53:02,214 --> 00:53:04,984
If you want this, buy me a beer.

747
00:53:09,084 --> 00:53:10,314
Who are you?

748
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,024
What did you give me?

749
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:19,223
It's warming you up, isn't it?

750
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:22,363
What did you...

751
00:53:23,464 --> 00:53:24,834
give me?

752
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:29,604
It's fine.

753
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:34,144
Oh, dear.

754
00:53:39,714 --> 00:53:42,414
Hey. Get up.

755
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:11,544
- Get rid of him. - Yes, sir.

756
00:54:19,024 --> 00:54:20,424
The Small Bookstore in My Hand

757
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,293
We got yours too.

758
00:54:22,294 --> 00:54:24,592
It looks bad. Mr. Kim's down.

759
00:54:24,593 --> 00:54:25,694
- What? - What?

760
00:54:31,903 --> 00:54:33,004
Hey, wait.

761
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,004
Walk...

762
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:42,613
to the entrance.

763
00:54:57,354 --> 00:54:58,493
Mr. Kim.

764
00:54:59,694 --> 00:55:00,794
Do you hear me?

765
00:55:08,274 --> 00:55:09,573
Mr. Kim.

766
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:12,343
Mr. Kim. Say something!

767
00:55:42,874 --> 00:55:44,444
Don't just stand here.

768
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,604
- Help him up. - Yes, sir.

769
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:47,774
Sorry.

770
00:56:03,924 --> 00:56:05,223
We're on the move.

771
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:07,064
Don't mess up.

772
00:56:08,734 --> 00:56:09,763
Yes, sir.

773
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:14,303
Head to the main junction.

774
00:56:28,113 --> 00:56:29,113
The Small Bookstore in My Hand

775
00:56:29,114 --> 00:56:30,383
Will he be okay?

776
00:56:32,653 --> 00:56:35,093
Where on earth are they taking him?

777
00:56:38,263 --> 00:56:39,964
I think we'll lose them.

778
00:56:45,104 --> 00:56:46,233
We lost them.

779
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:48,274
I can't let that happen. Hold on tight.

780
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,213
Careful. Slowly.

781
00:56:59,214 --> 00:57:00,683
- Watch out! - Be quiet.

782
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:03,313
Oh, dear. Sorry, my bad.

783
00:57:03,314 --> 00:57:04,323
Hey!

784
00:57:06,124 --> 00:57:07,124
The Small Bookstore in My Hand

785
00:57:17,263 --> 00:57:18,363
Where did they go?

786
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:21,473
I don't see them.

787
00:57:21,734 --> 00:57:23,403
We were right behind them.

788
00:57:24,644 --> 00:57:26,874
They stopped. We passed by them.

789
00:57:26,973 --> 00:57:28,013
What?

790
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,053
Shoot. What do we do?

791
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,754
The next U-turn's a way away.

792
00:57:39,124 --> 00:57:41,394
I'll get out first. Pull over.

793
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,573
You punk.

794
00:57:57,573 --> 00:57:59,644
I didn't like you from the start.

795
00:58:01,214 --> 00:58:02,214
Goodbye.

796
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:09,653
Wake up.

797
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:11,754
Wake up.

798
00:58:15,394 --> 00:58:17,452
Get out and cross the road...

799
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:18,493
with a smile.

800
01:00:26,053 --> 01:00:27,853
Who's that?

801
01:00:27,854 --> 01:00:28,993
Mr. Kim.

802
01:00:30,854 --> 01:00:33,092
Mr. Kim. Wake up.

803
01:00:33,093 --> 01:00:34,164
Get out.

804
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:37,234
Get out! He's not dead.

805
01:00:38,464 --> 01:00:39,632
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

806
01:00:39,633 --> 01:00:41,303
Wake up, Mr. Kim.

807
01:00:45,004 --> 01:00:47,674
You need to wake up. Please, Mr. Kim!

808
01:00:48,843 --> 01:00:51,044
- Hold on tight, Jin Eon. - What?

809
01:01:05,794 --> 01:01:06,894
The Small Bookstore in My Hand

810
01:01:08,593 --> 01:01:10,033
Darn it.

811
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,403
Darn it. Shoot!

812
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,323
Mr. Kim.

813
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:37,423
- Mr. Kim. - I'm okay. I'm...

814
01:01:37,424 --> 01:01:39,894
Will you wake up?

815
01:01:40,024 --> 01:01:42,164
Mr. Kim. Are you okay?

816
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,964
- Mr. Kim. - Are you okay?

817
01:01:46,363 --> 01:01:47,604
Mr. Kim.

818
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,183
Goodness.

819
01:02:09,153 --> 01:02:11,053
I'll eat it all up.

820
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:14,363
Here.

821
01:02:14,694 --> 01:02:16,294
Go Eun, get over here.

822
01:02:18,064 --> 01:02:19,803
Let's eat.

823
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,403
It smells fantastic.

824
01:02:25,444 --> 01:02:26,973
Come and sit down.

825
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,943
Hurry, Mr. Kim.

826
01:02:30,944 --> 01:02:32,314
Join us, Kim.

827
01:02:33,013 --> 01:02:34,783
I'll eat it all if you're not quick.

828
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:52,664
Walk...

829
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:55,133
to the entrance.

830
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:57,104
Mr. Kim.

831
01:02:57,633 --> 01:03:00,043
Mr. Kim. You need to wake up.

832
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:01,913
Please, Mr. Kim!

833
01:03:01,914 --> 01:03:03,113
Mr. Kim!

834
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:19,964
You're awake.

835
01:03:20,493 --> 01:03:24,334
How long was I out for?

836
01:03:24,964 --> 01:03:26,533
A whole day.

837
01:03:27,863 --> 01:03:29,803
Do you remember what happened?

838
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,004
It was really close.

839
01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:37,073
I have a few after-images,

840
01:03:37,944 --> 01:03:39,783
but I don't remember what happened.

841
01:03:41,013 --> 01:03:42,453
You really don't remember?

842
01:03:47,854 --> 01:03:50,754
Then you won't know how heroic we were.

843
01:03:51,524 --> 01:03:54,493
Do you know what a dreadful driver Gyeong Gu was?

844
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:03,803
You were like the people in the video.

845
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:07,504
Do you really not remember what they did to you?

846
01:04:10,674 --> 01:04:14,084
If that's too hard, go back to what you last remembered.

847
01:04:15,854 --> 01:04:17,013
The last memory?

848
01:04:17,584 --> 01:04:19,124
You start from there.

849
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,024
My last memory is...

850
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:41,044
That's...

851
01:04:43,214 --> 01:04:44,743
I found this.

852
01:04:52,754 --> 01:04:56,524
Taxi Driver 2

853
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:21,452
Don't you think we're getting a glimpse of what monster...

854
01:05:21,453 --> 01:05:23,853
rises in the city center when authorities...

855
01:05:23,854 --> 01:05:26,453
who should be catching evil join forces with them?

856
01:05:26,553 --> 01:05:29,693
See to it that those who hurt others get punished.

857
01:05:29,694 --> 01:05:31,963
I think the last thing Detective Choi said...

858
01:05:31,964 --> 01:05:34,193
is a message for you, Mr. Kim.

859
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:35,893
I'm here to pick up the seized narcotics.

860
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:39,063
They stole drugs that should be incinerated and sold them.

861
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:43,202
A perfectly-designed legal blind spot in Seoul's center.

862
01:05:43,203 --> 01:05:46,043
It's way beyond a playground.

863
01:05:46,044 --> 01:05:48,072
We can't take them down one by one.

864
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:51,073
We must take down the whole thing in one go.

865
01:05:51,144 --> 01:05:53,382
Can I see a photo of the new guard?

866
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:55,613
Kim Do Gi was here?

867
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:57,782
The goods seem fine.

868
01:05:57,783 --> 01:06:00,823
You punks dare try to stab me in the back?

869
01:06:01,084 --> 01:06:04,223
He has to show up. I'm sure of it.

870
01:06:04,424 --> 01:06:06,064
Kim Do Gi.

871
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:08,394
I'll kill you myself.
