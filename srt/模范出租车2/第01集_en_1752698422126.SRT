00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,580
Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin

Taxi Driver 2

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,860
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,460
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:34,939
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,180
Just three hours...

9
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,989
after a factory worker died after being crushed in a machine,

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,260
the production line was restarted, and word of that angered the public.

11
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:45,499
The company stated it was the worker's own mistake,

12
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:46,859
not an industrial disaster...

13
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,619
A man who attacked a woman who was heading home...

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,660
to the studio apartment she lived alone in...

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,340
was sentenced to five years in prison in the first trial.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,940
The man who worked for a private security company...

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,980
was heavily drunk and legally feeble-minded,

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,620
and pleaded for leniency.

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,220
I have some sad news.

20
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:05,899
Men who were charged...

21
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,179
with distributing pornographic files and sentenced to three years...

22
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:11,019
are awaiting the result of their appeal.

23
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:14,179
Meanwhile, one of their victims took their own life.

24
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,869
Family members say the victim...

25
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,059
suffered from extreme stress...

26
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:20,419
caused by her assailants' constant threats.

27
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:23,099
The online public is voicing their fury...

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,100
and demand the judiciary hand out justice.

29
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,180
Episode 1

30
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,939
Inmate 5283, come out to the corridor.

31
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,539
Today, the porn distributors...

32
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,469
will hear the result of their appeal.

33
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,629
One of the assailants disguised himself as a woman...

34
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,780
to make video calls...

35
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,220
and victimize women and children and sexually molest them.

36
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,860
Let go!

37
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,380
I heard you get out on probation today.

38
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,020
It must be nice to have some privileges.

39
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:04,259
I'd better have some. I spent a fortune.

40
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,420
Call me when you're out. I'll give you a spot.

41
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,020
Gucheon Penitentiary

00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,299
Emergency Transport

43
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,579
Did you save the videos before deleting the group chat?

44
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,579
Yes.

45
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,460
- Do you know what this is? - What's that?

46
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,700
A subway locker number and code.

47
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,939
Two years worth of subscriptions is in there, in cash.

48
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,500
This note is worth money?

49
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,060
Did you gather subscribers even behind bars?

50
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,699
Tens of thousands of viewers in Korea alone...

51
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,419
await our return.

52
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:04,539
If there's a demand, it's only right there be a supply.

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,020
One should always be ready to make money.

54
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,419
You have my respect, Boss.

55
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,019
Is it safe to do the same stuff after we get out on probation?

56
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,019
You moron.

57
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,139
We'll put a puppet in charge,

58
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,339
and set up a room for paid members on a foreign server.

59
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,379
To be honest,

60
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,940
I thought we'd rot in prison for a good few years.

61
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,499
We were on TV every single day.

62
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:24,709
Do you know why we're getting out?

63
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,020
Isn't it because you hired an ex-judge lawyer?

64
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,150
They forgot about us already.

65
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,660
This is why I love my country.

66
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,740
You're so right.

67
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,379
Boss.

68
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,339
Hey, you.

69
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,179
Buckle your belts.

70
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,150
Fasten your seat belts.

71
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,150
You moron. Were you talking to us?

72
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,270
Hey.

73
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,780
Let's not get into trouble now. Do as he asks.

74
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,660
Emergency Transport

75
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,060
What's happening?

76
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,059
Oh, shoot.

77
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:13,659
Hey.

78
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:50,739
You're not badly hurt, are you?

79
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,460
Come on. Get out.

80
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,099
Here.

81
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,140
Where are we?

82
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,379
What's that?

83
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,820
Deluxe

84
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,940
Get in, quick!

85
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,779
Deluxe

86
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,539
Nice one!

87
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:04,579
My throat is dry and sore.

88
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,460
Here, toast to our getaway.

89
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,780
Open one for me too.

90
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,420
Thanks. Guys, good job, surviving your time behind bars.

91
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:17,979
Here, cheers!

92
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,979
Cheers.

93
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:24,459
So,

94
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,620
who are you?

95
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,340
Me? I'm a subscriber.

96
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,700
A subscriber?

97
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,820
I'm a hardcore fan and subscriber...

98
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,700
of the group chat you set up.

99
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,100
If you show up in court today, you just go free.

100
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,700
Isn't that...

101
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,899
a bit too simple?

102
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:16,339
Boss.

103
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,579
I think you should wake up.

104
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,019
Boss.

105
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,019
What happened?

106
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,500
Boss, I think you need to see this.

107
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:36,699
What is it?

108
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,499
They were behind bars just until today.

109
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,500
During their attempt to escape,

110
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,379
they assaulted the guards on the bus...

111
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:44,139
and even took their weapons.

112
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,259
That looks like us.

113
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,139
No way, she said weapons were stolen.

114
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:49,059
- We didn't take anything. - Sorry, Boss.

115
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:51,659
What's that?

116
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,549
Why do you have that?

117
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,820
I don't know.

118
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,860
Due to the urgency of the situation, police put them on the wanted list.

119
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:58,859
The fugitives...

120
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,020
See? They're talking about us!

121
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,059
What did I tell you?

122
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,580
What the heck is going on?

123
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,980
They stole weapons too, so they could get a life sentence.

124
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,819
- A life sentence. - Darn it.

125
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,549
Hey, call the cops.

126
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,860
Say we'll turn ourselves in!

127
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,139
Okay.

128
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,020
This is crazy.

129
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,699
We were a sentence away from going free.

130
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,980
Do you think we're mad? Why would we escape?

131
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,940
Why aren't you calling the cops?

132
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,260
The phone is locked!

133
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,189
Police have located the fugitives' hideout.

134
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,190
The SWAT Team is preparing to raid it.

135
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:34,659
Locked

136
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:45,819
Freeze!

137
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,260
Stay down!

138
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,309
Don't move!

139
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,060
Please don't kill us...

140
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:55,189
SWAT

141
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,780
Look up!

142
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,860
Show your faces!

143
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,259
We didn't break out!

144
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,020
It wasn't us.

145
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:13,499
This is so not fair!

146
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,060
I really don't like the idea of them relaxing in prison.

147
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,380
They won't be able to.

148
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,100
When the owners of this note...

149
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,460
realize the two years' worth of subscriptions vanished,

150
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,940
they'll get pretty angry.

151
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,059
Two years worth of subscriptions?

152
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,260
It's our taxi fare.

153
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,939
Mr. Jang went to collect it already.

154
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,060
Mr. Kim thanks you for sending him to prison.

155
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,019
Getting him out was our problem.

156
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,900
We couldn't ask for your help...

157
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,779
when you're studying far away.

158
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:28,179
We won't meet again,

159
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,899
but wherever you are, I wish you the best.

160
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,339
Take care, Prosecutor Kang.

161
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,659
We got paid.

162
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,060
I thought we'd make nothing. Good for us.

163
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,380
Shall we head off now?

164
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,939
Well done.

00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,379
Good job, everyone.

171
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,980
Do you have any plans?

172
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,260
- What's up there? - An office?

173
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,979
I'm returning to my old job.

174
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:35,379
Me too.

175
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,339
There's an opening.

176
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,060
You guys must've been good at what you did.

177
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:42,019
What about you, Go Eun?

178
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,499
I'm taking the civil service exam next week.

179
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,379
- What? - Don't people study for years?

180
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:53,499
Are you taking it for fun?

181
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:56,939
Should we buy you some Taffy for good luck?

182
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,739
We don't eat Taffy these days.

183
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,420
What do you eat, then?

184
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,260
- Who eats Taffy these days? - It's chocolate.

185
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,140
I hope you pass.

186
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,220
Good luck.

187
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:09,939
This is it!

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,780

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,060
What are your plans?

190
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,500
I think I'll travel for a while, wherever my legs take me.

191
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,699
- Okay. - What about you?

192
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,860
Thanks for everything.

193
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,900
Your help is what got me started,

194
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:40,419
and you guys made it possible for me to stop.

195
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,899
Some of you are returning to where you were.

196
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,939
Some of you are making a new start,

197
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,819
and some are leaving.

199
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,659
I wish everyone is happy...

200
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,740
and at peace in their new positions.

Where are the others?

206
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,379
What do you mean?

207
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,500
I did it all on my own,

208
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,139
whatever it may be.

209
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,180

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,900

214
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,180
Do you have the proof of employment form I asked for?

215
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,220
What?

216
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,380
- Darn it. - Oh, dear.

217
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,740
Right, proof of employment.

218
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:38,739
I meant to bring it over but I forgot.

219
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:39,819
Give me a moment.

220
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,379
Oh, that hurt.

221
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,900
Why don't you hire a few more people?

222
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,780
The rest quit long ago.

223
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,740
This is for your grandchild's kindergarten, right?

224
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:55,979
Does no one want to work with you because of last year's incident?

225
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:59,779
I thought you were cleared of all charges.

226
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,260
The busier, the better. I get to exercise more.

227
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,100
It doesn't look like exercise.

228
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
It looks like you're giving yourself a hard time.

229
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,060
- Goodbye. - Bye.

230
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,300
Let's see...

231
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,459
- Mr. Jang. - What?

232
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,749
- You're hurt? - No.

233
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,270
- Let me have a look. - It's fine.

234
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,620
- Sit down. - It's not that bad.

235
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,270
The cars here...

236
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:30,579
are all so old, so it's not easy.

237
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,380
I'll try once more and if it's still no good, I'll send it to an expert.

238
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,989
I have no idea how Jin Eon and Gyeong Gu...

239
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:40,379
managed to fix all these.

240
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,019
I bet they cursed me out as they did.

241
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,580
Do you miss them?

242
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,749
Don't even think of calling them over.

243
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,300
They're all doing just fine with their own lives.

244
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,820
Never again do I want to see...

245
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,099
the people I care for...

246
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,270
get hurt or suffer.

247
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,099
I don't think I can take it anymore.

248
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,779
Is that why you were so mean...

249
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,180
when they visited?

250
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,779
Was I mean?

251
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:12,939
I guess I didn't want them to go.

252
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,420
Why didn't you send me away?

253
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,540
That's unfair.

254
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,380
If I sent you away, you'd just...

255
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,180
do the same stuff on your own somewhere.

256
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,180
Rather than let you do that, I thought it best if I helped out.

257
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,300
Don't you think?

258
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:31,699
It's all done.

259
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,180
Yes.

260
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,340
No one else should sacrifice themselves for my sake.

261
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,220
Can you go to the basement...

262
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,700
and bring me a lantern?

263
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:47,989
This one's about to go out.

264
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,179
Okay.

00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:47,699
The successful launch of the sixth vehicle...

271
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,509
resolved the recurring issues we had...

272
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,060
with stabling the fuel injection of the third pod...

273
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,180
as well as the safety of the oxidizer tank.

274
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,339
The Successful Launch of Launch Vehicle 6

275
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:58,779
How does it feel to complete the successful launch?

276
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,779
It hasn't sunk in just yet,

277
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,340
and it feels odd not to have any homework left.

278
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,270
Meanwhile, it's nice to know that the mission was completed...

279
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,580
by using parts crafted domestically.

280
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,300
The high-performance retro motor designed to prevent collision...

281
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,860
that aided the separation of the first pod...

282
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,859
is not only light in weight but also small in size.

283
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:16,989
Adding one or two of them to a deluxe taxi...

284
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,580
would generate greater output.

285
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:21,059
- Did he say deluxe taxi? - A deluxe taxi?

286
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,220
Korea Aerospace Laboratory Press Conference

287
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,660
What was the question again?

288
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,750
This pager. Is it yours?

289
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:41,579
- Yes, it's mine. - I haven't seen one in a while.

290
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,700
Do they even work these days?

291
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,460
I have it for sentimental reasons.

292
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,780
Enjoy your meal, then.

293
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,900
How has it been for you lately?

294
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,580
Good. I've been enjoying tasty meals...

295
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:03,939
and have been earning a lot of money.

296
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
Same here.

297
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,260
I can't taste anything.

298
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,500
Maybe I'm suffering from andropause.

299
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,940
You too? I've been like that too.

300
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,939
I get why I'm in this situation, but you're still relatively young.

301
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:18,659
Murder, robbery, rape, assault, and burglary.

302
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:19,659
The number of adolescents...

303
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,180
who have been arrested for these five crimes...

304
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,980
- mount up to... - They should be taught a lesson.

305
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,619
The victims have no one to call anymore.

306
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,059
A source within the police department...

307
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,500
I am being transferred to the Russia office.

308
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,060
Are you being reprimanded?

309
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,140
Come on. It's more like a promotion.

310
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:36,299
A promotion to Russia?

311
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,740
- For how long? - Five years.

312
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,740
That's a long time.

313
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,741
- Once I wrap up this project. - It's too long.

314
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:47,459
Shouldn't I at least say goodbye to Mr. Jang before I go?

315
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,580
Mr. Jang? And have him give you an earful?

316
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,820
Did Mr. Jang give you an earful?

317
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,660
You have no idea. If looks could kill...

318
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:58,019
I told you numerous times not to come back here.

319
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,580
Don't you know what it means to be fired?

320
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,260
You are not to come back here ever again.

321
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Do you hear me? You're fired!

322
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:07,219
At least he didn't mention his funeral to you.

323
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,259
His funeral?

324
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,940
Don't come back here ever again.

325
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,900
Even after I die,

326
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:13,939
don't bother coming to my funeral.

327
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,980
How can he not want me at his funeral?

328
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,060
He wants us to go our own ways, that's all.

329
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,380
I get that, but...

330
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,220
We should see how he's doing though, right?

331
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,939
- Right. - Here you go.

332
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:27,779
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you.

333
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,940
Have a good day.

334
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:33,339
Missing, Name: Lee Dong Jae

335
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,459
Excuse me. You dropped this.

336
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,380
Thank you.

337
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:59,179
- Sir... - Officer Ahn.

338
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:00,259
Ma'am.

339
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:03,219
Don't tell me you're sticking your nose...

340
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:04,619
in other departments' cases again.

341
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,059
He's been looking for his son for over a year now.

342
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,980
Locating his son would help him immensely...

343
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,180
Stop your meddling and get ready to clock out.

344
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,899
Everyone's expected at the team dinner today.

345
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,140
Ma'am.

346
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,059
I told you before...

347
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,860
that the Information Management only digs up requested information.

348
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,859
Don't just stand there and get your things.

349
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:24,939
Sure.

350
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,939
- That's it. Pass. - Yes!

351
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:36,899
- Go on. - Yes!

352
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:38,579
Pork belly

353
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:41,419
Can you believe it?

354
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,980
The father you wanted to help earlier...

355
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,340
His son is of age.

356
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,340
He isn't missing. He ran from home.

357
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,500
And we can't reveal the information of those who ran off...

358
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,700
without their consent.

359
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:53,419
We can't rule out the possibility of domestic abuse.

360
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,979
Did it seem that way to you?

361
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,340
Who I saw...

362
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,900
was a father looking for his son.

363
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,980
I guess you could be right.

364
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:08,619
But we can't make a judgement call without having the facts.

365
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,140
If we don't help someone in front of us...

366
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,620
who needs our help,

367
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,860
what is the purpose of our existence?

368
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,820
You're just following protocol.

369
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:26,379
Goodness, Captain. You must already be tipsy.

370
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:27,579
If we cross the line...

371
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,660
and ignore protocol just because we can,

372
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:32,699
we'll be going from police officers to offenders of the law.

373
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,419
There's also another rule you should keep in mind.

374
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
This is...

375
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,820
a job.

376
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:43,379
Watch out for termination, pay docking,

377
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:46,699
and your HR performance evaluation.

378
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,700
Can I have a cigarette?

379
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,900
Darn it.

380
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:52,579
I'd rather he stay out of other teams' businesses.

381
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,540
Officer Ahn, don't mind him.

382
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Here.

Missing since getting a job at Cotaya

389
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:46,219
Please find our son. His family awaits his return.

390

391
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:04,739
Dong Jae, I'm sorry.

400
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:41,019
Tell me your story.

401
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:46,019
Tell me what has happened to you.

402
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:02,179
Well...

403
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,579
Ambulance

404
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,300
I have a son who is the apple of my eye.

405
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,740
His mother died when he was young,

406
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:38,059
and I raised him while running a small business.

407
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,460
Take this and enjoy it with your friends.

408
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:42,139
- I forgot the radish. - No!

409
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:43,939
Who takes fried chicken to school?

410
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:47,459
Don't forget to write down important notices.

411
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:49,579
Dong Jae's Fried Chicken

412
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,980
See you later, Dad!

413
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,459
- Have fun in school. - It was a lot for a boy to take,

414
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,540
but he grew up to be a fine young man.

415
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,459
- Happy birthday. - Thanks.

416
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:04,299
Son, happy birthday.

417
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:05,859
But I'm still in high school.

418
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,499
You can have the beer I allow.

419
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,700
Mr. Lee, where are ours?

420
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,700
- That's mean of you. - Stop that.

421
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:13,139
Come by when it's your birthday.

422
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,740
Cheers.

423
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,860
Hello?

424
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,060
Sure. It'll soon be delivered.

425
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,980
One boneless.

426
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,339
Son, don't you have classes today?

427
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,140
I'm good. The lecture was cancelled.

428
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:39,179
I see.

429
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:45,219
Give me a second.

430
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:48,579
I wasn't able to get an additional loan.

431
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:50,259
If you give me more time...

432
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,780
You give me the same excuse every six months.

433
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,180
If you can't make the payment, just terminate the contract.

434
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:59,299
But then we'll be forced out to the streets.

435
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,900
Don't make me the bad guy...

436
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,299
and tell me if you'll renew your contract...

437
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,420
by the end of this month.

438
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:08,899
But...

439
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:19,059
Boneless, right?

440
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
Dad.

441
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,139
I have something to say.

442
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,940
I'll be going abroad as an exchange student...

443
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:30,979
for two years.

444
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,820
An exchange student?

445
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,580
I was offered a scholarship...

446
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,820
and a room at the dorm.

447
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:37,899
For two years?

448
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:41,979
Can you manage alone while I study abroad though?

449
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,500
Is this a good opportunity for you?

450
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,340
A tremendous one.

451
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,179
Others would kill for this chance.

452
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,740
Fine. I'm happy if you are.

453
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,419
This really wasn't necessary, you know.

454
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,780
A man of age should have a decent suit.

455
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,780
Gosh.

456
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,580
Would you like your initials embroidered on the sleeve?

457
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,430
No, that's fine.

458
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,340
Yes, please do that for us.

459
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,739
Here, Dad.

460
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,219
What's this?

461
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,459
The alarm has been set to when you should take your medicine.

462
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,100
I'll call once a day.

463
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,299
You...

464
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,500
My son, let me give you a hug.

465
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,500
Dong Jae would've made me proud...

466
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,300
- no matter what he did. - Get going.

467
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:39,429
Have a good time.

468
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,870
But not long after,

469
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,540
I sensed that something was up.

470
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,539
My son

471
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:55,499
My son had been contacting me every day,

472
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:58,539
but I wasn't able to hear from him for over 15 days...

473
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,100
which I found odd.

474
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:04,619
Dong Jae's Fried Chicken

475
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:08,389
- You're here. - What?

476
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:11,179
Actually, I was just passing by.

477
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:14,659
If you give me more time, I'll get you the money.

478
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:16,539
- It's all right. - What?

479
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:18,339
I was already paid, so everything's good.

480
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,909
You were paid?

481
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,620
I can't find it in me to lie to you.

482
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:24,779
Your son paid the rent.

483
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:26,179
He paid you?

484
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,219
But my son doesn't have that kind of money.

485
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:30,139
Dong Jae took time off school to work at his new job.

486
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,140
I heard that he got a refund for his tuition.

487
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:36,059
He got himself a job? I thought he left to study.

488
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,300
He said he was going to spend two years earning money.

489
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,140
Employment Contract

490
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:55,499
That's when I found out.

491
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,580
You brat.

492
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:59,739
Dong Jae didn't go overseas as an exchange student.

493
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,700
Stop working that job and get home immediately.

494
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,870
My son

495
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:10,099
Stop working that job and get home immediately.

496
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,429
This is my fault, Dong Jae.

497
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:19,619
I'm coming to you.

498
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:31,220
Cotaya, Vietnam

499
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:52,939
I went to the company that had employed my son,

500
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,620
but...

501
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,940
nothing was there.

502
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:58,459
Is this where we are?

503
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:00,979
Yes, this is where we are.

504
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,540
You can't report your son missing...

505
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,980
just because you haven't heard from him...

506
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:13,059
ever since he left for a job overseas.

507
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,139
He's 25 and of age.

508
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,539
Why don't you be patient with him?

509
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,779
I even received a phone call.

510
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:24,429
Hello?

511
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:27,779
Hello?

512
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,140
- Dong Jae, is that you? - I'm sorry!

513
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,700
Hello? Dong Jae!

514
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,500
- Take a look at this. - I already did, sir.

515
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,980
Maybe the address is wrong.

516
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:42,939
Something happened to Dong Jae.

517
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,660
He wouldn't go back on his promise to call every day.

518
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:47,779
Something must've happened...

519
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,910
that's keeping him from calling.

520
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:54,699
Mr. Lee, we understand your concern.

521
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:56,739
It's not like he's in Korea, right?

522
00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:01,659
We'll look into the matter and get back to you.

523
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,139
- Please head home for now and... - Why do you keep saying that?

524
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:06,259
Why?

525
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:07,659
You're a piece of work, sir.

526
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:08,979
Why are you badgering us...

527
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,820
when your son's not choosing to call you?

528
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,140
What do you mean by that?

529
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:15,869
Dong Jae's not calling on purpose?

530
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:19,499
Get on with your work. I'll inform him.

531
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:24,429
Were you able to contact my son?

532
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:26,429
Why don't you have a seat, sir?

533
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:33,979
After you came in the other day,

534
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,140
we looked into the matter.

535
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:41,139
Your son called the embassy himself.

536
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:43,299
He doesn't want you to find him.

537
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,300
There's nothing we can do for you...

538
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,909
when someone of age refuses to be contacted.

539
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:54,909
Why won't you believe me?

540
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:57,339
What exactly aren't we believing?

541
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:00,659
There isn't a father on this earth...

542
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,059
who wouldn't recognize his son's voice.

543
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:04,779
It was his voice I heard,

544
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:07,459
and I saw that the company didn't exist at the address.

545
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:10,459
Why won't you believe me?

546
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,540
Since you won't find my son,

547
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:18,579
I'll look for him myself.

548
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:31,739
Thank you.

549
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,219
Missing, Name: Lee Dong Jae

550
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,059
He spent ten months overseas...

551
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,220
looking for his son by handing out these flyers?

552
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:44,779
If they had informed the father of his whereabouts at the beginning,

553
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:46,219
he would've been easier to find.

554
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,979
The police were only following protocol.

555
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:52,779
Anyone over 18 without a criminal record...

556
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:54,909
is considered a runaway, not someone who's missing.

557
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:58,339
And the police can't even track one's credit card payments...

558
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,870
if the runaway is of age.

559
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:02,739
That'll be a violation of his rights.

560
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:13,059
When I got home,

561
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,580
that letter was in my mailbox.

562
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:18,659
Lee Dong Jae

563
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,819
Dad, don't be so sad just because I'm gone.

564
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:27,659
I wouldn't have been able to help even if I were alive.

565
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:32,979
I have no regrets. Life is so hard. I'm sorry.

566
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,020
Yes.

567
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,020
Righteous and Honourable Police

568
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:38,059
I see. Okay.

569
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,220
New Police of Hope

570
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:44,179
They evaluated the handwriting,

571
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,939
and it was written by the same person.

572
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,140
That can't be.

573
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,259
I didn't have the heart to tell you the other day.

574
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:53,539
Your son called us from the area...

575
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,780
where a lot of foreigners went to gamble illegally.

576
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,780
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

577
00:41:04,259 --> 00:41:05,259
There's no way...

578
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,620
my son became a gambler.

579
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:12,459
I'm looking for my son.

580
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:13,909
Please take a look at this.

581
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:15,909
Here. Please take a look at this flyer.

582
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,059
Please take a look at this.

583
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:21,389
This is my son. Please.

584
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:23,739
Missing, Name: Lee Dong Jae

585
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,259
Missing, Name: Lee Dong Jae

586
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:36,099
Life is so hard. I'm sorry.

587
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:39,059
But if his son indeed wrote that suicide note,

588
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,390
there's nothing we can do.

589
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:42,059
The handwriting analysis said it matched his son's,

590
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,060
so he probably wrote it.

591
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,980
But he couldn't have written it willingly.

592
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,220
What makes you say that?

593
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:52,389
Check the bottom of the letter.

594
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:55,869
They probably left it as it is, thinking it was just a scribble.

595
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:01,499
Lee Dong Jae served in the military as an operations soldier.

596
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,220
He was a signalman.

597
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:05,429
He was probably used to Morse code.

598
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,059
Save me.

599
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:35,619
Come on. You have to stop saying you don't know.

600
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:38,019
You should study and try to figure it out.

601
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,700
Don't you want to go back home to see your mom?

602
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:48,139
Sir, this is what I made so far.

603
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,659
You're dirty. Get off me.

604
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:53,219
What?

605
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,580
Come on. Look at that!

606
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:57,059
With some studying, he pulled it off.

607
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,220
- Hey, give him some food. - Okay.

608
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:01,019
- Take this first. Drink it. - Okay.

609
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,620
- Thank you. - Good work.

610
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,180
This is amazing.

611
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,020
Hello?

612
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:23,539
Is that you, Dong Jae?

613
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,939
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry.

614
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,020
- Have you gone mad? - Hey.

615
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,300
- Are you crazy? - You little...

616
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:34,499
Hello? Dong Jae!

617
00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:45,429
I'm sorry.

618
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,420
Save me.

619
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:53,739
Save me.

620
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:55,539
Save me.

621
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:58,539
He was forced to write this suicide note.

622
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:00,299
So some people forced him.

623
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,900
Now that we got his message,

624
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,300
we should write back.

625
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:15,499
Save me.

Hello,

00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,220
thank you for choosing our Rainbow Deluxe Taxi.

633
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:18,619
For your safety and convenience,

634
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:21,139
I'll explain a few rules.

635
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:22,819
While the deal is in place,

636
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:25,859
the cab's meter will keep on running.

637
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,940
The fees will be dealt with once the whole deal is done.

638
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,820
There may be some extra charges depending on the deal,

639
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,700
and once you use our service,

640
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:37,259
you must not breach our work...

641
00:45:37,259 --> 00:45:40,259
to anyone.

642
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,580
Thank you for complying with the rules.

643
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,340
Now, if you'd like to get revenge on those who made you suffer,

644
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,979
press the blue button on the left.

645
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,980
If you don't want to get revenge, press the red button on the right.

646
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,060
Please make your choice.

647
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,299
Dad.

648
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:04,259
I set the alarm for when you'd have to take your medicine.

649
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:05,459
Dad. You didn't forget to take your medicine, right?

650
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,060
My gosh, Dong Jae.

651
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:08,259
Okay.

652
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,420
- Did you eat? - You took your medicine, right?

653
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,300
I already took it.

654
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,580
- Dad, look at this. - Yes?

655
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,420
- Didn't I do a good job? - Yes. You did.

656
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,420
Gosh.

657
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,019
Dad. You didn't forget to take your medicine, right?

658
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,220
Take it now.

659
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:28,059
Dad. You didn't forget to take your medicine, right?

660
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,060
Take it now.

661
00:46:29,139 --> 00:46:30,179
Dad.

669
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:20,339
So where will you go first?

670
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,060
Lee Dong Jae submitted his resume to the head office in Korea.

671
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,460
So I'll go there first.

672
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:26,979
You can just stay in the office.

673
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,180
What are you talking about?

674
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:30,699
Where you go, I go too.

675
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,940

Deluxe Watch and Clock Repairer

677
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,020
Their office abroad is a cattle farm.

678
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:53,019
And their head office in Korea is under construction.

679
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,780
I see. They must have used addresses of the buildings that...

680
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:57,539
have been abandoned for a few years.

681
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,700
I should check if there are any recent job listings...

682
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:04,379
under this address.

683
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,739
Go Eun's

684
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,140
You're not waiting for me, right?

685
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:21,899
They probably erased any job listing on the recruitment website that...

686
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,660
showed any connection to the company.

687
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:26,259
If they already deleted the job listings,

688
00:49:26,259 --> 00:49:28,259
getting a lead would be difficult.

689
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,419
That's not necessarily true.

690
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:33,979
They may have been able to delete all possible leads.

691
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,580
But it won't be easy to get rid of their habits.

698
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,420
So these are the job listings they posted online, right?

699
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,540
Only the names are different. Line spacing, font, and styles...

700
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,179
are exactly the same.

701
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:36,619
I see. It's just like you said.

702
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:39,339
It's not easy to break habits.

703
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:41,739
What's this?

704
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,500
I submitted a similar resume to Lee Dong Jae's.

705
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,060
It took less than 24 hours to get a response.

706
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:47,659
A resume?

707
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,900
It specifies the same conditions as Lee Dong Jae agreed to.

708
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,500
It's for a position overseas.

709
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,540
Wait.

710
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,179
Then do you plan to go abroad yourself?

711
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,460
Yes.

712
00:50:59,461 --> 00:51:01,941
Wait. To pull this off abroad and not in Korea,

713
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:03,979
we'll have a lot more restrictions.

714
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,060
I don't have much of a choice.

00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,780

00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:34,739
Dad.

718
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,139
Where are you now?

719
00:51:43,779 --> 00:51:45,019
I'm on my way.

720
00:51:45,779 --> 00:51:47,259
I've been thinking.

721
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:49,499
This case is challenging in many ways.

722
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,420
If we're not thorough with our plan,

723
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,740
you might actually end up in danger.

724
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,379
I think so too.

725
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,059
Then hurry back.

726
00:51:57,259 --> 00:52:00,059
Let's come up with a detailed plan to solve this case.

727
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,700
Okay. I'll be there soon.

728
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,780
You can go in now.

729
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,900
Thanks.

00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,100
He's not here.

734
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:40,419
- Should we check his office? - Sure.

735
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,180
Mr. Jang isn't answering his phone either.

736
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,700
Did something happen?

737
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:54,499
Seeing how there aren't other workers here,

738
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,700
he must have been running this place alone after we left.

739
00:52:57,619 --> 00:52:58,739
Gosh.

740
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:00,219
What?

741
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:02,899
Missing, Name: Lee Dong Jae

742
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,420
Hey, take a look at this.

743
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,300
Missing, Name: Lee Dong Jae

744
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:14,219
That's a missing person poster. What about it?

745
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,660
It was in Mr. Jang's drawer.

746
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,980
This poster was in Mr. Jang's drawer?

747
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:21,219
He rarely keeps posters like this in his drawer.

748
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:25,059
Right. He usually stores important items in his drawer.

749
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,980
That means...

750
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:29,779
this is very important.

751
00:53:29,779 --> 00:53:32,139
The sign outside said he was out of the office.

752
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:34,379
- And he's not answering his phone. - That means...

753
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:45,459
Mr. Jang!

754
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,460
Mr. Kim!

755
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,420
The deluxe taxi is still here.

756
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,940
Right.

757
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,740
- Were we wrong? - Were we?

758
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,940
You guys!

759
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:08,299
What is this? What are you doing here?

760
00:54:09,699 --> 00:54:11,059
Have you been well, Mr. Jang?

761
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,180
Why do you care? I told you never to visit me again.

762
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,140
I made myself clear with you two.

763
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,899
I'm getting transferred abroad for the next five years.

764
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,980
I came to say goodbye.

765
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,580
Right. What does your transfer have to do with me?

766
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:26,739
Whatever. You two should get out.

767
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,300
Never come back here.

768
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:33,379
Okay. We'll get going.

769
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:38,619
Bye, Mr. Jang.

770
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,700
Gosh. They don't look so good.

771
00:54:53,339 --> 00:54:55,179
They should take better care of themselves.

772
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,300
Did you sense it too?

773
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,540
Yes. He was so awkward.

774
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,620
Exactly.

775
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,300
I'm sure he's hiding something.

776
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:09,580
And I think this is it.

777
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:17,139
Rainbow Transport

778
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:22,460
Cotaya International Airport

779
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,860
I arrived safely in Busan.

780
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,660
But this is an international call.

781
00:55:28,819 --> 00:55:32,019
You don't know how dangerous it might be. Why did you go alone?

782
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:33,979
We should prepare ourselves thoroughly and go as a team.

783
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,340
Because I don't know how dangerous it might be,

784
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,540
it's much better to be on my own.

785
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,980
You can back me up in Korea.

786
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,620
Are you sure?

787
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:44,539
I'll give you information on the people I meet here.

788
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,100
You can run background checks on them for me.

789
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,580
Okay. I'll set up the computer soon.

790
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:58,259
Hey.

791
00:55:58,819 --> 00:56:00,899
Cheongeum? Yes.

792
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:04,259
- Gosh. It's nice to meet you. - It's hot, right?

793
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:06,219
Yes. Your suitcases. Help them load their suitcases.

794
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:09,179
Hey, it's all set here.

795
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,060
Can you see them?

796
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:21,139
Yes. Crystal clear.

797
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,140
Where are you going?

798
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:25,699
They could have picked us up in front of the arrivals gate.

799
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:27,659
But they designated a meeting spot outside the airport.

800
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,340
That must be the blind spot for security cameras.

801
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,540
- Hello. - Hello.

802
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,620
You guys can get acquainted later.

803
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:39,339
- Let's get going first. - Okay.

804
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:41,139
Hey, let's load one more suitcase!

805
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:48,659
Watch out here.

806
00:57:58,299 --> 00:58:00,539
It's been a while, Go Eun. Have you been well?

807
00:58:01,299 --> 00:58:03,739
You know that your actions and words don't seem to match, right?

808
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,140
We found this in Mr. Jang's office.

809
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:10,819
- Odd, right? - What do you mean?

810
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,660
I'm sure Mr. Jang and Mr. Kim...

811
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:15,299
are up to something without us.

812
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:16,779
I agree with him.

813
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,020
Officer Ahn.

814
00:58:19,819 --> 00:58:22,259
Are you busy? We're backlogged.

815
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,740
I'll be right there.

816
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,620
I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of my shift.

817
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:29,659
Gosh. No.

818
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,100
Let's talk later.

819
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,740
Okay. You're busy. You should get back to work.

820
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:34,219
Take care of yourself.

821
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,299
- Bye. - Okay. Bye.

822
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:38,699
She must be very busy.

823
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:40,779
Go Eun seems to be doing well.

824
00:58:40,779 --> 00:58:42,139
Let's not distract her. We should go.

825
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,420
That leaves us with no choice. We should handle it ourselves.

826
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,660
We'll face it head-on.

827
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,020
Face it head-on?

828
00:58:48,739 --> 00:58:50,379
I've got an idea. Come with me.

829
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:52,539
Are you coming up with a plan?

830
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,980
That's so cool.

831
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,900
We promise to make Seoul safe, free from the 4 evils of society.

832
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,220
We promise to make Seoul safe, free from the 4 evils of society.

833
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,300
Information Management

834
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,979
All right. Do you like it?

835
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:22,739
This is what Vietnam is famous for. The coconut juice.

836
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:27,139
Okay. I'll be sharing a useful tip with you guys.

837
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:28,339
- Do you like sports? - Yes.

838
00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:29,659
Like skin scuba diving and surfing?

839
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,700
If you take classes every weekend,

840
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:33,499
you can get a certificate.

841
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,300
The job listing said the company provided room and board.

842
00:59:38,299 --> 00:59:40,059
But do we have to pay money?

843
00:59:40,299 --> 00:59:42,139
No. The company will provide everything.

844
00:59:43,259 --> 00:59:45,459
Do you like seafood? How much seafood have you had?

845
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,980
Shark fins? Caviar?

846
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,220
People here eat them as side dishes.

847
00:59:49,259 --> 00:59:50,659
Gosh. Don't eat stuff like that.

848
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:52,339
Okay. This is the last day you'll have this.

849
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,019
Let's eat shark fins and caviar now.

850
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,620
Gosh. Isn't that tasty?

851
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,139
Registering runaways, District: Dongbuk-Gu

852
01:00:01,659 --> 01:00:04,019
Lee Dong Jae, male

853
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,780
Lee Dong Jae, male

854
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:20,139
Arrival and departure records

855
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,700
Search arrival and departure records.

856
01:00:27,339 --> 01:00:29,299
Kim Do Gi, Current status: Departure

857
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,860
I'm sure this is the route Lee Dong Jae took.

858
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,060
The new recruits?

859
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,180
Of course. They're taking selfies and pictures of each other.

860
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:49,939
They're having a blast.

861
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:53,179
Yes. Hurry up and do it. Okay.

862
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,060
Are you sure you'll be okay on your own?

863
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,780
I'll find out...

864
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,340
if Lee Dong Jae was indeed here. And if he was here,

865
01:01:01,259 --> 01:01:02,739
I must find out what happened here.

866
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:04,579
I'll try to identify the guide.

867
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,860
Don't push yourself too hard, though.

868
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,300
I used to take care of this on my own back in the day.

869
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:10,379
Don't look down on me.

870
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,660
I was merely telling you not to push yourself too hard.

871
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:17,059
Guys! Cheongeum!

872
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,900
All right. Let's get going.

873
01:01:19,339 --> 01:01:21,059
Gather around, guys.

874
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:23,459
Come back here.

875
01:01:24,299 --> 01:01:27,179
- Okay? Okay. - This is a nice photo too.

876
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,740
My goodness. The driver went to the wrong place.

877
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:34,259
The ride won't be as comfortable, but we should make do. Let's go.

878
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:36,059
- Okay. - Get in now.

879
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:37,499
Hold on.

880
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,020
- Can you give me your cell phones? - Why?

881
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:41,019
I'll replace your SIM cards with local SIM cards.

882
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,140
Then I'll return them to you.

883
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:43,219
- Okay. - We're in Vietnam.

884
01:01:43,219 --> 01:01:45,219
You can send photos faster that way. The company will cover it too.

885
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:46,579
- Get in now. - Okay.

886
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:05,459
The scenery looks very different from before.

887
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,500
It's better to work in the countryside.

888
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:10,819
The air is fresh. Right?

889
01:02:12,219 --> 01:02:13,659
There's no fine dust here.

890
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:15,859
We're almost there. Hang in there.

891
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:52,739
What?

892
01:02:56,259 --> 01:02:57,459
What's happening?

893
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:59,460
All right, guys. Look at me.

894
01:03:00,139 --> 01:03:02,539
This is my last useful tip for you.

895
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,020
Study hard. Okay?

896
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:13,819
Kim. Can you hear me?

897
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:15,739
Kim!

898
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,380
Why did you hang him upside down? He's not some meat.

899
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,060
Put him down.

900
01:03:57,259 --> 01:03:58,579
Thanks for coming.

901
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:02,179
Resume, Kim Do Gi

902
01:04:02,299 --> 01:04:03,419
I checked your resumes.

903
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:06,219
Not bad for new recruits.

904
01:04:07,179 --> 01:04:08,179
All right.

905
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,500
Let me conduct a survey now.

906
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:14,979
Speak up if you qualify.

907
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,860
Who here can play baccarat?

908
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,180
Who here can play Badugi?

909
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,780
Darn it. Don't be shy now.

910
01:04:28,779 --> 01:04:30,339
Me.

911
01:04:30,339 --> 01:04:31,379
Right.

912
01:04:32,659 --> 01:04:34,619
Next. Who here can play poker?

913
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,140
Come on. I'm talking to myself.

914
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:41,499
They don't seem to get it...

915
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,260
because they graduated from third-rate universities.

916
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,860
Hey, we should teach them how to talk first.

917
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:08,819
All right. Let me ask you again.

918
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,900
Who here has played online games even if it was just once?

919
01:05:12,139 --> 01:05:14,419
- Me. - Me too.

920
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,180
That's it. I have to beat you up to get you to talk.

921
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:21,060
All right. Starting now,

922
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:24,099
you will be making all kinds of game programs...

923
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,220
that I can put online.

924
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,939
You all majored in computer science. I'm sure you'll be great.

925
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:34,779
C Programming Practice Questions and Answers

926
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,660
If you need help, refer to the books.

927
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,140
I'll check it every morning.

928
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:41,419
Are you telling us...

929
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,860
to make illegal gambling programs?

930
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:46,779
You're smart.

931
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,460
I only majored in graphic design.

932
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,860
I don't know how to program.

933
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,420
You don't know? Then I'll teach you.

934
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,060
- Grab his hands. - I really don't know.

935
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:59,020
Sir. But his hands...

936
01:05:59,779 --> 01:06:02,739
Darn it. Come here.

937
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,740
Hey, you don't know how to program either?

938
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:12,059
No. I'll give it a try.

939
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,180
That's it.

940
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:14,859
They all said they didn't know how to do it at first.

941
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,660
But they all turned out to be great programmers. Okay?

942
01:06:16,659 --> 01:06:17,659
Yes.

943
01:06:21,619 --> 01:06:23,619
You're back.

944
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,460
Hey. Say hello. They are your seniors.

945
01:06:26,659 --> 01:06:29,219
Just like you guys, they didn't know anything at first.

946
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,980
But look at them.

947
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,540
They are experts.

948
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:40,940
Gosh.

949
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,060
Look at that face.

950
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,860
Do you feel wronged?

951
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,220
If you do feel wronged, blame your poor...

952
01:06:49,219 --> 01:06:51,179
and ignorant parents.

953
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,340
There's only one way you can get out of here alive.

954
01:06:56,619 --> 01:06:59,179
Working hard.

955
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,100
Got it?

956
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,660
All right. Go to your rooms.

957
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,540
Start studying!

958
01:08:27,339 --> 01:08:30,629
The shell is hard, so peeling it wasn't easy.

959
01:08:31,299 --> 01:08:32,379
Enjoy.

960
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:56,939
Wang Tao Zi.

961
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,339
He came to ruin my life.

962
01:09:00,339 --> 01:09:02,059
You punk.

963
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:37,019
Taxi Driver 2

964
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,020
Break one of his ankles tomorrow.

965
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,020
Sleep tight.

966
01:09:40,021 --> 01:09:41,671
Mr. Kim is there by himself?

967
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:42,819
Anything can happen to him.

968
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,380
It's worse than I thought.

969
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:47,259
I can't escape by myself and leave the other guys behind.

970
01:09:47,259 --> 01:09:51,459
I never trust men.

971
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:52,459
We'll go back to the head office.

972
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,820
I apologize for the commotion.

973
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,460
Mr. Kim. That chairman...

974
01:09:55,459 --> 01:09:56,749
If you haven't gotten all of their suicide notes,

975
01:09:56,749 --> 01:09:57,979
make sure to get everyone's.

976
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,300
Write down exactly what I say.

977
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:03,219
Life is so hard. Bye, everyone.

978
01:10:03,219 --> 01:10:04,379
I can't be certain either.

979
01:10:04,379 --> 01:10:07,419
- Kill him now! - Are you okay? Mr. Kim.

980
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,060
All of us can go back home safely.
