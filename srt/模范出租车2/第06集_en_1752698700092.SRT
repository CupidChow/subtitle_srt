00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:08,899
Lee Je Hoon

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,460
Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,979
Jang Hyeok Jin, Bae Yu Ram, Shin Jae Ha

4
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,979
Taxi Driver 2

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,579
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,178
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,900
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,498
This episode features child actors.

9
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,178
We put their safety and welfare first,

10
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,899
and filmed with guardians present.

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,859
We thank the child actors for doing so well despite the cold.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,819
Episode 6

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:51,060
Hold on.

14
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:02,859
You guys aren't married, are you?

15
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,149
Is it easier to buy a home if we're not married?

16
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:15,868
Just say the word.

17
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,899
We can always get divorced to...

18
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,789
What do you think, sweetie?

19
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,979
You're such an amusing couple.

20
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,500
Thanks for the great show.

21
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,860
Did something just go wrong?

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Yes. I think he caught on.

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,979
Shoot. What do we do now?

24
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:12,340
We kneel and beg.

25
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,470
Desperately.

26
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,630
Mr. Kang.

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,419
Mr. Kang.

28
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,660
I'm sorry. As you said,

29
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,579
we're not really married.

30
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,859
We're colleagues...

31
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,539
and we wanted a home so badly.

32
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,979
I'm really sorry to have deceived you.

33
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,660
You tried hard.

34
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,579
A bit too hard.

35
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:55,418
I'd have fallen for it if I hadn't come by.

36
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:56,859
When I look at you,

37
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:59,660
you look like you're so much in love.

38
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,739
I'm really sorry.

39
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:10,139
So you two,

40
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,660
just so you could buy a home, you got married on paper...

41
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:16,060
when you didn't want to?

42
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,579
I'm so sorry.

43
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Mr. Kim.

44
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,259
Do you remember what I said?

45
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:34,859
Do you remember the kind of people I said I help?

46
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,538
People who don't own a home.

47
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:41,340
No. People who are desperate.

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,499
I can't stand that you lied to me,

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,940
but I love your desperation.

50
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,220
I got to see your reality.

51
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,259
Shall we see your future?

52
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,220
Our future?

53
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:03,819
It's not bad, is it?

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,939
Isn't that the royal floor?

55
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,019
- It looks amazing. - Gosh.

56
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:10,859
Come in.

57
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,299
Mr. Kang.

58
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,709
This is amazing.

59
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,020
This apartment. It's incredible.

60
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:36,739
You're that excited about a set?

61
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,780
What's your blood type, Mr. Kim?

62
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,859
Type A.

63
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,299
- And you? - Type B.

64
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:45,619
A and B.

65
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,379
You two have the perfect combination.

66
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,830
Whose name will you put on the deed?

67
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,978
What do you mean?

68
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,179
It doesn't hurt to decide that in advance.

69
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,379
Oh, well...

70
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,100
Does that mean...

71
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,619
you chose us?

72
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,619
Yes!

73
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,780
We did it!

74
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:21,339
Why don't we get married for real?

75
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,019
No way. Shall we?

76
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,220
Yes!

77
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,058
I'm pleased to see you're pleased.

78
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,298
Thank you.

79
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:31,539
You'll hear from us. Look after your wife's health.

80
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:34,259
Her health?

81
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,179
You didn't know? Your wife's pregnant.

82
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,979
I'm not pregnant.

83
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:45,140
You are if I say you are.

84
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:49,580
Let's say I'm a magician of sorts.

85
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,580
Congratulations.

86
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,780
"In the dark sky,"

87
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,460
"a little light sprung up."

88
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:16,538
"The rabbits danced about..."

89
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,539
"and went back home."

90
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,699
"Captain Granny..."

91
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,419
"fell into a sweet, deep sleep."

92
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,939
"Good night, everyone."

93
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,259
The end.

94
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,100
- Was that fun? - Yes.

95
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,179
What shall we do next?

96
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,538
Can I draw the rabbit from the book?

97
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:39,780
The rabbit?

98
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,378
Let's see. Where was the rabbit?

99
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,820
Here it is. Do you mean this rabbit?

100
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,460
- Yes. - Okay.

101
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:47,660
Hang on.

102
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,619
Won't the drawing look much better on this?

103
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,900
If you draw with these?

104
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,140
Can I draw on this?

105
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,179
Of course, you can.

106
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,660
Thank you.

107
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,580
You're welcome.

108
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,298
I'm looking for...

109
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,339
Seo Yeon's adoption papers, but it's not easy.

110
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,779
I'm looking as well, but there's nothing at all.

111
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,059
Lots of places still keep handwritten files.

112
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,820
That won't show up online.

113
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,579
Any adoption process requires...

114
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,379
a legal representative, an adoption expert.

115
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:28,939
That can't be omitted.

116
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,419
How about we start looking into that?

117
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,339
There seems to be...

118
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,739
another problem with Seo Yeon.

119
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,499
Another problem?

120
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,099
Kids playing in a rainy playground?

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,539
The rain looks weird.

122
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,780
It's not rain.

123
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,900
Those are steel bars.

124
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,059
Bars?

125
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,580
She's not playing in a playground.

126
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,059
She's watching them.

127
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,499
From behind bars.

128
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,580
My mom

129
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,340
Seo Yeon.

130
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,550
You're awake, So Mang?

131
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,259
Seo Yeon. I miss my mom.

132
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:18,060
When can I see her?

133
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,979
So Mang.

134
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,190
Shall we play tag in the playground?

135
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,940
Rock-paper-scissors.

136
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,190
Rock-paper-scissors.

137
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,619
Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

138
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,379
Here.

139
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:47,059
Stop where you are

140
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,060
I lost.

141
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,340
I came down the slide...

142
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,310
to run after you.

143
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,499
Kids.

144
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:38,899
Hey. Get up.

145
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,060
Get up!

146
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Uncle's here. At least pretend to be happy to see him.

147
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,499
Okay.

148
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,549
How are you, kids?

149
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,619
Uncle's here.

150
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,379
- Hello. - Hello.

151
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,459
Will you clean up? There's nowhere to sit.

152
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,340
I told the kids to clean up.

153
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:11,820
Gather around.

154
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,059
Sit down.

155
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,420
You little monsters.

156
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:21,700
Wait.

157
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,820
Here you go.

158
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,460
Jingle. No, not yet.

159
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,259
Good.

160
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,259
Eat slow but quickly.

161
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,419
There's dust everywhere.

162
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,619
Move.

163
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,060
So Mang. You're So Mang, aren't you?

164
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:11,820
How old are you?

165
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,180
So Mang is four years old.

166
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,618
Four.

167
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,099
Dreamland Orphanage List, 2022

168
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,540
Let's see.

169
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,379
Mr. Kang

170
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,940
Hello, Mr. Kang. I was waiting for your call.

171
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,259
Mr. Kim.

172
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,700
Are you ready to be a dad?

173
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:49,060
Pardon?

174
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:53,060
I'll text you a map. Bring your wife.

175
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:58,940
Do you have any questions?

176
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,539
No, I don't.

177
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,658
We're prepared to do anything.

178
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,259
You people are so lucky.

179
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:09,580
Thank you, Mr. Kang. Good...

180
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,940
- He hung up. - What did he say?

181
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:15,738
He wants me to bring Go Eun.

182
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,419
I guess he'll mention adoption.

183
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,580
Then...

184
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,060
he might take you to where the kids are.

185
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,019
Where on earth are these kids from?

186
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,700
Shall I enter the US market?

187
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
Shall I?

188
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,659
Director Park, Dreamland

189
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:51,420
Darn it.

190
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,820
What do you want?

191
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,979
How are things with Seo Yeon?

192
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,498
Have you found her yet?

193
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:04,019
We're looking for her.

194
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:06,179
She's school age, so she's...

195
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,820
no good to us even if we find her.

196
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,820
Why do you ask when you don't even care?

197
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,219
Is Seo Yeon eight already?

198
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,379
Pay attention to them. Don't get shut down again.

199
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,179
Mr. Director of Dreamland.

200
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,258
I got a new sign put up last week. We're called Dream Butterfly now.

201
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:24,340
Dream Butterfly Orphanage

202
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,340
I called to say that...

203
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,580
this month's payment hasn't come in.

204
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:33,779
Can you wire the money soon, Mr. Kang?

205
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,060
Goodbye.

206
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,460
The alcoholic moron.

207
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,379
Darn him.

208
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,579
Parking for Visitors Only

209
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,019

210
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,300

211
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,778

212
00:14:58,779 --> 00:14:59,859
Naram Women's Hospital

213
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,259
Naram Women's Hospital

214
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,419
Hello.

215
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,939
Mr. Kang's waiting inside.

216
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
Okay.

217
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,460
Naram Women's Hospital

218
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,699
They're here.

219
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Doctor's Office

220
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:22,138
- Mr. Kang. - Take a seat.

221
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,019
- You first. - Thank you.

222
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,499
You act like a real couple.

223
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,619
It's business.

224
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:33,340
Do you have a name for the baby?

225
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:35,419
Pardon?

226
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,259
You're not ready at all to be a dad.

227
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,180
Are you usually this slow?

228
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,460
No, I'm quick-witted.

229
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:47,778
You want us to adopt, don't you?

230
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:49,339
Gosh, no.

231
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,219
Adoption is a good way to increase your shot at winning an apartment,

232
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,580
but a lot of due diligence goes into that.

233
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,939
That's too much work.

234
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,019
It's just that...

235
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:02,018
you two are incredibly lucky.

236
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,059
Faith, hope, charity

237
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,580
Your desperate plea reached the heavens.

238
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,700
No. It reached me.

239
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,739
What are you talking about?

240
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,138
Delivery Room

241
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,540
Mr. Im's here.

242
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,060
Okay.

243
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,979
Registration of Birth

244
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,420
A baby will be born here.

245
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,259
Register the baby as yours.

246
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,940
Then you can skip the due diligence.

247
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
It's your baby.

248
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:54,580
Authorities will have no reason to evaluate you.

249
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:57,340
We must register a baby as ours?

250
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,299
Are you afraid you'll have to raise it?

251
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,618
Don't worry about that.

252
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,259
We'll collect the kid when the time's right.

253
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:06,340
Later on, when everything's taken care of,

254
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,179
you just have to report the kid missing.

255
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,340
Registration of Birth

256
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,659
Excuse me.

257
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,539
Why call from next door?

258
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,580
Come in.

259
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,619
What? Okay.

260
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,138
I'll be right back. Fill this in.

261
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:27,179
Okay.

262
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:39,990
Your wife...

263
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,060
looks upset.

264
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:50,750
She's having trouble thinking of a name.

265
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:52,859
It's not like you'll keep the kid.

266
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,269
Pick one of those words.

267
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,750
Faith, hope, charity.

268
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,580
Oh, not So Mang. We have a kid with that name.

269
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,020
Let's go.

270
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,990
Faith, hope, charity

271
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:09,459
Seo Yeon and So Mang.

272
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:13,540
This is how they've been taking the kids.

273
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:17,859
This is it.

274
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:26,659
This chair has a nice cushion.

275
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,659
Not so hard or she'll miscarry.

276
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,820
Okay.

277
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,179
Will you do it?

278
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:35,619
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,060
I can't do it.

280
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,619
Why you...

281
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:42,699
My gosh.

282
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:46,139
You clueless, immature little girl.

283
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,510
Don't get scared or you'll lose the baby.

284
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,539
You're an unwed mom and we found you...

285
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,618
a couple and we rented this hospital.

286
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:55,020
That cost a fortune.

287
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,659
If you back out, can you pay us back?

288
00:18:58,699 --> 00:19:00,658
I'll work and pay you back.

289
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:01,659
You'll work?

290
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,580
That won't work.

291
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,820
- Is it money you need? - I don't need money.

292
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:09,820
I just want to keep the baby.

293
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,780
This won't do.

294
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:18,898
Please spare me.

295
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,579
Please don't hurt my baby.

296
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,020
I beg of you.

297
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,819
Let me go.

298
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,989
Did I say I'd kill your baby?

299
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,820
Don't even say that.

300
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:29,698
Hand it over.

301
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:32,699
- Please let us... - Don't you dare touch me.

302
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:35,300
What's that noise?

303
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,379
It sounds like there's a fire.

304
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,780
How could there be a fire when it's just us here?

305
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:44,990
My gosh.

306
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,379
Let's go.

307
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:56,419
Hello.

308
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,539
I guess today's not the day.

309
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,179
Let's do this some other time.

310
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,858
Childbirth takes a while,

311
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:05,859
with all the labour and hard work.

312
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:08,299
Mr. Kang!

313
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,510
The unwed mom...

314
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:12,990
She ran away.

315
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,139
So what?

316
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,618
Pardon?

317
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:16,939
Go after her.

318
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,510
Yes, sir.

319
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,060
Excuse us.

320
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,179
Where the heck did she go?

321
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,060
She messed things up.

322
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:52,779
There she is.

323
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,270
She put me through all that only to get this far?

324
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:00,580
She got me in so much trouble.

325
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:04,270
Stop.

326
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,100
Look at her run. She won't stop.

327
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:16,750
Should I break a limb?

328
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:19,219
That would work.

329
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,699
What's to stop me?

330
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,619
What the...

331
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,179
Are you kidding me?

332
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,300
You're all right. They won't follow you anymore.

333
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
You're safe now.

334
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,859
It's all right.

335
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,100
You're all right.

336
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,659
Deluxe

337
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,179
I was terrified.

338
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,980
He said he'd take care of my child.

339
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:16,659
And I believed him.

340
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,299
The House for Single Mothers Is Always Open.

341
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,540
The House for Single Mothers

342
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:43,859
I got a call from Mr. Jang of the Blue Foundation.

343
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,580
- Thank you. - This way.

344
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,019
He took the children from single mothers...

345
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,419
and had other couples register their birth.

346
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:57,779
That means it'll be impossible...

347
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,859
to locate the children through an adoption agency.

348
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,020
What do we do, then?

349
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:08,060
You said that Kang Pil Seung had over 30 apartment units.

350
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,419
He even has buildings.

351
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:10,820
It's a long list.

352
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:14,500
Can you mark all of them on a map?

353
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:16,379
Of course.

354
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,300
Ownership of Real Estate

355
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,219
They're all in the big city.

356
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:36,340
Which one of them has the lowest investment value?

357
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,260
The lowest investment value?

358
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:40,899
Just a second.

359
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,379
Why do you want to know?

360
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:46,060
A property that has a low investment value...

361
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,619
owned by a master in the real estate business?

362
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:52,179
A property he owns not for its monetary value?

363
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
It's this one.

364
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,459
He owns a store in an old commercial building.

365
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:04,020
It's being run as a photo studio.

366
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:06,219
This place...

367
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,619
is near where we first met Seo Yeon.

368
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,300
Deluxe

369
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,859
Baekryeon Photo Studio

370
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:34,500
The equipment is being used even though the store is closed.

371
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
The photo studio hasn't reported any sales.

372
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:46,300
So they take photos like these for free?

373
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,859
That's a photo of Seo Yeon's family.

374
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:55,780
But the parents aren't the ones we know.

375
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:09,540
I now get why Seo Yeon's foster parents...

376
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:10,939

378
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,500
We'll frame the photo you take today,

379
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,780
so hang it up in your house where it can be seen.

380
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,499
I learned that nothing's more effective...

381
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
than this for evaluation.

382
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,859
- Sure thing. - Thank you, Mr. Kang.

383
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,820
Go and stand by your parents.

384
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,020
Sure.

385
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:50,939
Are you my mom?

386
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:52,980
What do you think you're doing?

387
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
What's wrong?

388
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,219
- Well, she... - What has gotten into you?

389
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,980
Hey, orphan.

390
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:04,300
You don't have a mom.

391
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,899
I told you what would happen if you disobey me.

392
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:11,820
I'm sorry.

393
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,419
I won't do that again.

394
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,740
Gosh. No, don't cry.

395
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,619
Let me see a smile. Peekaboo.

396
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,020
Sir, can you smile bigger? Say, "Apartment."

397
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:39,659
- Sure. - In 1, 2, 3.

398
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:01,939
Seo Yeon has had four sets of parents in total.

399
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,979
I hope it all goes well.

400
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,178
We're putting our trust in you.

401
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:09,378
A unit of 83 square meters would be more than enough.

402
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:11,379
- Right. - A unit of 83 square meters.

403
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,418
- We hope it goes well. - Sure.

404
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,139
- Don't worry. - Have a good day.

405
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,979
I hope it all works out.

406
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,379
I can see how desperate you two are.

407
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,540
- I hope it goes well. - Sure.

408
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,340
I can't believe it.

409
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,300
How could he do this to a young child?

410
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,379
So Mang!

411
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,179
I'm off to see my mom and dad.

412
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,379
Let's go.

413
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,459
Uncle, let me go in her place.

414
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,059
I see you're enjoying this now.

415
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,938
You have somewhere else to be, so get back inside.

416
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:20,939
Get back inside.

417
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,899
- So Mang! - Get back inside.

418
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,659
Uncle!

421
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,139
Seo Yeon?

422
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,580
Goodness.

423
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:51,780
Was it a nightmare?

424
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:54,500
I need to find So Mang.

425
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,340
She must be really scared by now.

426
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,179
That's why you said...

427
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:02,340
you needed to give her a hug.

428
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,379
Because you know she'd be scared.

429
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,139
You poor thing.

430
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,259
They'll soon be here,

431
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,500
- so set things up. - Got it.

432
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,139
Get over there.

433
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,419
You're only going to take photos, so quietly sit over there.

434
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,820
Don't you dare talk to the adults. Got it?

435
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:39,219
Sit on that chair.

436
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,659
- Who are you? - Anyway...

437
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,820
Hold on.

438
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:51,500
I didn't hear about you taking a photo today.

439
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,300
Are you my dad?

440
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,340
On behalf of the adults, I apologize.

441
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:11,500
What do you think you're doing?

442
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,580
What's going on? Who did that?

443
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:18,938
You will turn around and loudly count to ten.

444
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:20,300
- What... - Take that.

445
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:22,898
Don't you dare.

446
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,060
Close your eyes, cover your ears,

447
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:26,780
and don't turn around.

448
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:29,859
Hey, roll this back up.

449
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,540
Who do you think you are?

450
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,779
- Let me take your photos. - What?

451
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,899
Strike that.

452
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,740
You all need a beating.

453
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,019
One, two...

454
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,340
Darn you!

455
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,820
Three.

456
00:33:58,659 --> 00:33:59,858
Four.

457
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:01,618
Darn it!

458
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:03,100
Five.

459
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:05,419
Six.

460
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,219
Seven.

461
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,259
A little bit more.

462
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,298

463
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:21,819

465
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,139
Where are the other kids?

466
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,429
Please spare me.

467
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,659
Cut the nonsense.

468
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:40,339
Where are they?

469
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:44,299
Nine.

470
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Ten.

471
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,909
It was loud, wasn't it?

472
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:58,060
You did well counting the numbers.

473
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,139
Good job.

477
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,699
so that they could obtain apartment units.

478
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,298
Afterwards, they took the children back...

479
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:39,259
and had other families adopt them.

480
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:43,698
How could he do such a thing?

481
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:45,619
And for what reason?

482
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:49,909
He has 30 apartment units under his name.

483
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,460
How could he have managed that?

- You can't barge in here. - It's all right. Let them through.

503

Don't come near me. You can talk from there.

504
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:04,659
Mr. Kang, how could you do this to us?

505
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:06,389
We did as you asked.

506
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,258
We registered the birth of a kid that we didn't know...

507
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:11,579
and adopted another child because you told us to.

508
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,138
What are we supposed to do now that you have stolen our house?

509
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:16,738
Gosh, be careful with those harsh words.

510
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:18,299
What did I steal?

511
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:20,499
You won the house in your name,

512
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,868
and I collected the children.

513
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:25,138
And let me get this straight. I did all the heavy lifting.

514
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:26,618
I loaned you the money...

515
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,339
and even collected the kids.

516
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:31,658
What exactly did you guys do?

517
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:33,618
You told us to pay back the loan so soon.

518
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,939
How's that any different from taking all we have?

519
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,739
What's wrong with me recovering my investment?

520
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,178
You don't have any money...

521
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:41,658
which is why I took your house instead.

522
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,869
What's so wrong with that?

523
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,020
I'll report you to the police!

524
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:49,580
Go ahead. Call the police.

525
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:51,499
You illegally adopted a child,

526
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,019
so you will have to give up your apartment anyway.

527
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,100
You'll then be arrested for committing a crime.

528
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:59,460
On top of that, you'll still have a debt to pay.

529
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,259
My gosh. Will you be able to handle it all?

530
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:06,980
It's like I said before.

531
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:10,540
That desperation of yours?

532
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:14,388
Gosh, I respect that.

533
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:16,178
Keep having that level of desperation.

534
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:19,299
I'll wish you luck in getting your own home.

535
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:22,099
- Now, get lost. - Mr. Kang.

536
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,138
- Leave. - I won't let this slide.

537
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:27,699
- You won't get away with this. - How lame.

538
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:33,179
What now?

00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500

00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:38,259

543
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:52,389
Step on it.

544
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,060

00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:00,779
What?

559
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:03,500
You gave them hope that they'll get to have parents...

560
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:07,259
but only to crush them. Then, you kept on repeating it.

561
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,100
Was there never...

562
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,540
a pang of guilt?

563
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,339
I asked for your child's name. What nonsense are you talking about?

564
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:19,428
You should tell me who your kid is...

565
00:41:19,429 --> 00:41:20,909
so that I can pass the word.

566
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:24,699
"Your dad's dead."

567
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,060
Goodness.

568
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:33,580
Gosh, that's toasty.

569
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:36,139
Who do you think you are?

570
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:57,339
Get in. Hurry up.

573
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,259
- Hurry. - Yes, sir.

574
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:14,869
- Hurry. - Get in!

575
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,429
- Get in! - We're running out of time.

576
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,500
Gyeong Gu, they're loading the kids into the van.

577
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,020
Where's Mr. Kim?

578
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:32,500
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

579
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:35,299
We're on our way to you.

580
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,259
No, don't come to me and track Kang Pil Seung.

581
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,389
The kids come first.

582
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,459
Don't be ridiculous. You're in danger.

583
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,540
Do as I say!

584
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:45,540
Don't lose him and stay on his tail.

585
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:48,020
I'll be right behind you.

586
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:50,298
Mr. Kim comes first.

587
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:52,259
But he told us to tail Kang Pil Seung.

588
00:42:52,389 --> 00:42:54,179
But Mr. Kim will die!

589
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,540
Gyeong Gu, what are we supposed to do?

590
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,219
We'll do what we always do.

591
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:02,699
Mr. Kim is in charge of the planning.

592
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:04,779
Let us go after Kang Pil Seung.

Old Bachelor's Fresh Fruits

594
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Are you all right?

595
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,900
I'm going to cover you with this.

596
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,259
I know it will be hard to breathe. But can you stay strong for me?

597
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,980
Here.

598
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,100
Are you okay?

599
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,619
Are you hurt?

600
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,460
Thank you for being so strong.

601
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:50,299
Let's go.

602
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:32,940
You didn't lose him, right?

603
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,500
- Mr. Kim. - See? I told you he would be fine.

604
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,139
I'll catch up quickly.

605
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,618
Mr. Im

606
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:56,739
Mr. Im isn't answering his phone.

607
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,020
Gosh.

608
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,779
I should move.

609
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,060
Be quiet.

610
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:08,339
I told you to be quiet.

611
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:15,980
Mr. Jang

612
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:20,500
Seo Yeon had a bump on her head.

613
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:21,739
Her doctors said...

614
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:25,299
she must have been hit constantly before the wound had time to heal.

615
00:46:26,259 --> 00:46:27,699
It will leave a scar.

616
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,500
Darn.

617
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,179
Please find So Mang.

Hey.

623
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,940
Hey, forget it. You should get off here first.

624
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:47,179
- The kids aren't with him. - Where are the kids?

625
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:48,659
They're gone.

626
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:51,178
I bet he hid them here. Let's look for them now.

627
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:52,259
- Okay. - Okay.

628
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,339
What is it this time?

629
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,659
Go check on that!

630
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:08,580
Who's causing trouble here? Darn it.

What's going on?

00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:25,219
What?

635
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,540
You... Who on earth are you?

636
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:46,339
Kids.

637
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:52,380
Where are the kids?

638
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:54,460
Get lost, you jerk.

639
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:02,980

643
00:49:10,299 --> 00:49:11,299
Kids.

644
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,699
Kids.

645
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,699
Did you find them?

646
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,459
No.

647
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,259
Darn it. Where did he hide the kids?

648
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,619
Tell me.

649
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,139
If you kill me,

650
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,060
the kids will die.

652
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,939
Kill me. Go ahead.

653
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,020
Kill me.

654
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:18,819
Do it.

655
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:22,540
You ought to be careful around me if you want to save the kids.

656
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,100
This is more like it. The kids will only survive then.

657
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:27,380
Gosh. This is why I love kids.

658
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,658
I protect the kids.

659
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,500
And the kids protect me.

660
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,019
This is what's called a win-win situation.

661
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,100

You know what?

666
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:04,219
If you let me kill you here,

667
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:06,020
I'll let the kids go.

668
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,540
But if you dodge it,

669
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,020
every single one of them will die.

670
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:15,779
Okay?

671
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,980
Mr. Kim, I found the kids.

672
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,619
Did you stop me? Let go of my arm.

673
00:51:52,699 --> 00:51:53,699
Did you stop me?

674
00:52:08,779 --> 00:52:11,420
Gosh. You're one crazy guy.

675
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,699
Do you want the kids to die?

676
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:20,739
What?

677
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,940
Don't tell me. Did you find them?

678
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,819
What? Where am I?

679
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,139
Where on earth... This is disgusting!

680
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,659
What do you think? Do you like this place?

681
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:54,020
I tried to think of a fitting house for you.

682
00:52:54,259 --> 00:52:55,460
And this was the best place for you.

683
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,380
Search thoroughly if you need something.

684
00:52:57,659 --> 00:52:59,020
You can probably find everything here.

685
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:05,739
Okay. I'll give you a house. Okay?

686
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,138
It's close to the subway station, has a view of the Han River,

687
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,379
and is on the best floor.

688
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,020
You know it's not easy to get a house like that in Korea.

689
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,020
Look. Mr. Driver.

690
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:16,659
You live in Korea, after all. I'm sure you want to own a house.

691
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,178
I'll give you one of my best apartment units.

692
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:20,819
So release me. Okay?

693
00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:23,420
I doubt that you have a house like that.

694
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,539
What are you talking about? I have a lot of houses.

695
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,779
Let me go.

696
00:53:30,259 --> 00:53:31,779
- Gosh. - Goodness.

697
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,739
Oh, my. And this.

698
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,980
Gosh. He organized them so nicely. It's easy to take everything.

699
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,499
Take his seal too.

700
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,819
Here's my last chance for you.

701
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,339
If you answer my question truthfully,

702
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:48,060
I'll let you go.

703
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:50,299
- Really? - I promise.

704
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:54,900
Okay. I'll answer it truthfully.

705
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:01,699
Have you ever...

706
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:04,980
felt sorry for those kids even once?

707
00:54:06,259 --> 00:54:10,339
Why on earth do you want to know about that now?

708
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,980
Answer it truthfully.

709
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,819
Those kids were abandoned anyway.

710
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,138
It'd be nice to pick up those kids and put them to good use.

711
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:22,619
I fed them and gave them a place to sleep.

712
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,579
That was the most economical way to increase the points.

713
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,580
Each kid on the application brought a lot of points.

714
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,658
People could easily get a house...

715
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:31,460
when they listed the kids on the application.

716
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:34,860
Wouldn't you do the same? Wouldn't you use the kids?

717
00:54:37,219 --> 00:54:39,658
What about the pain you caused these kids?

718
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:41,338
Who cares?

719
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:42,900
They won't even remember that.

720
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,218
I really answered your question truthfully.

721
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:49,259
So let me go now.

722
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,178
- No. - What?

723
00:54:52,179 --> 00:54:57,059
You'll never be able to get out of here. Not even a step.

724
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,219
What are you talking about? You promised to let me go.

725
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,739
Did you keep your promise?

726
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,338
You promised the kids countless times...

727
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:06,219
that you would bring them to their parents.

728
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:09,139
Have you ever kept that promise even once?

729
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,658
Gosh. Sir.

730
00:55:11,659 --> 00:55:15,339
What's the point? You won't remember a thing after today.

731
00:55:15,739 --> 00:55:16,818
Why does that matter?

732
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:18,019
What do you mean I won't remember it?

733
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,380
That's nonsense.

734
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:20,900
Hey.

735
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,219
Golden Ticket

736
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,060
Congratulations. This is your house.

737
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,860
What? Stop it.

738
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,020
Stop it!

739
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,339
Don't leave.

740
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,540
Don't go.

741
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:48,299
Don't go.

742
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,139
Where are you going?

743
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,900
No. Stop that.

744
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,540
Hey, stop that!

745
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,580
Stop it. Don't do it!

746
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,339
No!

747
00:56:13,819 --> 00:56:15,339
Old Bachelor's Fresh Fruits

748
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,060
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

749
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:23,900
That's my favourite. The zucchini juice.

750
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:26,060
There's zucchini juice?

751
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,500
You made it for me.

752
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:29,419
I see.

753
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,699
Mr. Kim, you're done for the day. Right?

754
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,139
Yes.

755
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:36,739
Then before you do that, should we get a divorce first?

756
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,060
That's a shame. But we should, right?

757
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:45,259
Sure. Our divorce just went through. Signed, sealed, and delivered.

758
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,900
"Sure?"

759
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,900
Deluxe

760
00:56:56,299 --> 00:56:57,339
Sign-in and Sign-out Card

761
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,618
Do Gi.

762
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:06,738
Drive safely, follow traffic regulations

763
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:07,860
You're here early.

764
00:57:08,739 --> 00:57:10,860
Or no? Are you just getting off work?

765
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,580
I'm getting off now.

766
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:15,259
I'm jealous. I just started my shift.

767
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,940
Taxi 5678 beginning service.

768
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,060
Sure. Drive safely.

769
00:57:21,339 --> 00:57:22,380
Rest up.

770
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,940
Seoul

771
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:39,060
Take the elevator, not the stairs

772
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:26,540
Take about seven customers today.

773
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,940
Yes, sir.

774
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:15,060
Park Jin Eon, Ahn Go Eun, Choi Gyeong Gu

775
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:18,339
Kim Do Gi

776
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:28,579
A while ago, we covered the news about the apprehension...

777
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,939
of an illegal organization...

778
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,299
that helped people adopt kids and terminate adoptions.

779
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,460
But today, we have heartwarming news to share.

780
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:37,579
Generous donations have been made anonymously...

781
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,939
to 33 child welfare centers all over the country.

782
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,860
The news of these generous donations has garnered all the attention.

783
00:59:43,339 --> 00:59:44,420
- Hey. - Without revealing the identity...

784
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,179
Did you donate all of the money? Including our fees?

785
00:59:47,299 --> 00:59:51,259
They're growing kids. They need to eat well.

786
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:55,619
Supporting them until they become of age costs a fortune.

787
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:56,699
Okay?

788
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,618
Thanks for making the long trip.

789
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:19,019
I love this neighbourhood.

790
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,658
Grandpa!

791
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,379
Gosh, Seo Yeon. Have you been well?

792
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,178
I missed you, Grandpa.

793
01:00:25,179 --> 01:00:27,380
I missed you too.

794
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,019
Happy birthday.

795
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,699
So Mang, say hello to Grandpa.

796
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,099
Hello.

797
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,179
Goodness, you're So Mang.

798
01:00:38,299 --> 01:00:40,379
Hello. Nice to meet you.

799
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,459
We didn't light the candles. We waited for you.

800
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,460
Is that so?

801
01:00:44,461 --> 01:00:46,779
Then should we rush over and celebrate your birthday?

802
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,299
All right. Let's go. So cute.

803
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:50,739
Okay.

804
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,819
So Mang, Seo Yeon

805
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:04,860
East Gate: The EST

806
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,460
Why are we here?

807
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:13,020
You're looking for a house.

808
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:16,259
Jin Eon and I worked really hard to find this place.

809
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,179
But it's my house. Why did you two do that?

810
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,060
The guy in the commercial is really famous.

811
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:23,459
Famous? Who?

812
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,940
This guy is only slightly more handsome than me.

813
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,659
I see. The guy who's only slightly more handsome than you?

814
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:32,019
It'll be nice to live in a place like this.

815
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,539
But I can't afford to buy this place.

816
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,819
Hey, Go Eun.

817
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,860
A house is not to be bought, but to be lived in.

818
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,380
Whatever.

819
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,818
Let's go. I'm hungry.

820
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:44,940
You can't be hungry. Let's go.

821
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,980
But this does look like a nice place.

822
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,258
What are we going to do? We lost our house!

823
01:01:54,259 --> 01:01:57,778
- Come on. Be quiet. - You're not going to do anything?

824
01:01:57,779 --> 01:01:58,819
Darn it.

825
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,580
Who is it at this house?

826
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,339
Who are you?

827
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,500
Seo Yeon has two wounds that can't be healed.

828
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,020
You will have to explain to me...

829
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,139
why she has such wounds.

830
01:02:34,779 --> 01:02:36,500
What's this? Hey.

831
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,939
I have 33 houses!

832
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,579
Mr. Choi! Take care of him!

833
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:42,939
How dare you treat me like I'm some homeless man?

834
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,060
Mr. Choi!

835
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:48,380
How dare you treat me...

836
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:28,100
I didn't do it.

837
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:30,499
I can explain everything to him.

838
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,420
That guy, the taxi driver, took everything!

839
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:47,540
The taxi driver?

840
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,299
Can you...

841
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,540
tell me what happened in detail?

842
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,659
Taxi Driver 2

843
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:28,019
You'll have to explain why the kids have wounds that can't heal.

844
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:31,658
Call 112 to report child abuse. Call 182 for missing children.

845
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:32,979
There are priests in Catholic churches.

846
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,258
And in Sunbaek Church, there's the Father.

847
01:04:35,259 --> 01:04:37,459
No! That's not it!

848
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,379
You cannot go to hospitals.

849
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,459
- Over here! - You cannot enter.

850
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,698
You're calling yourself her family, but you're stalking her.

851
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:47,939
Please help my sister.

852
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:49,138
Are you in pain?

853
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:52,019
I will not give up!

854
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,499
It's obvious that this is a cult.

855
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,698
Mr. Park, can you punch me five times?

856
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:57,738
Beware of what's up above.

857
01:04:57,739 --> 01:04:59,540
You're fated to die young.

858
01:04:59,779 --> 01:05:02,138
You managed to stay alive.

859
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:03,859
What on earth are you doing there?

860
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:06,218
- Is that some kind of a silly game? - A silly game?

861
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:08,299
They could already be watching us.

862
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:10,259
They might be much closer than we think.
