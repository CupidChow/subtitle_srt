00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,060
Lee Je Hoon

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,499
Kim Eui Sung, Pyo Ye Jin

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,859
Jang Hyeok Jin, Bae Yu Ram, Shin Jae Ha

Taxi Driver 2

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,138
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:34,099
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,939
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,498
- Let's drink. - It's been so long.

9
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:39,499
Episode 9

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,300
Nothing pairs well like makgeolli and grilled eel.

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,579
How's the job?

12
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,579
You fired your employees...

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,940
and have been taking on retrials.

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,779
What can I do when I can't handle their pay?

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,859
I'm trying to hang on until things get better for me.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,619
You should've taken up on that offer to become special prosecutor.

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,019
It'd be nice for people to know your pretty face.

18
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,739
You wanted me to be a puppet...

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,419
in a play that was already designed?

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,509
I guess you're right.

21
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:16,699
You're ballsy, I give you that.

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,978
I can't believe you had this sent to the deputy prosecutor's office.

23
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:23,699
Him being my junior is why he didn't throw it away.

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,940
That's why I sent it there.

25
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:29,539
I knew your junior would deliver this to you.

26
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,660
What's that next to my name?

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,059
Detective Jang. Is that you?

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,299
Thanks for getting me this.

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,459
The meal will be on me today.

30
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:48,699
- The Kang Pil Seung case. - Yes?

31
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:52,179
It seemed peculiar just like you said.

32
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,178
A real estate broker donated his entire savings...

33
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,459
only to be found dead in the woods after living on the streets.

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,019
I can guess...

35
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,539
who made him donate his entire savings.

36
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,499
But who could've fabricated the death of a homeless person...

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,380
as suicide...

38
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,699
is beyond my apprehension.

39
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,859
By the looks of it, someone cut their loose ends.

40
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:22,259
The fact that it was closed as a suicide case...

41
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,780
tells me that whoever it is has the police on their payroll.

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,019
The one who cut their losses could be a big organization.

43
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,660
It's why I say this.

44
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,910
Isn't it about time you stopped?

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,539
What do you mean?

46
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:37,629
I don't want to see you get hurt.

47
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,258
What are you saying?

48
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,978
Have your eel while it's warm.

49
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,819
Take me seriously, will you?

50
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,099
It's nice that you're helping people,

51
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,379
but only because you remain unharmed.

52
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,139
What good will it do if you get hurt in the process?

53
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,380
I'm not helping people.

54
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,060
Consider it...

55
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:04,739
my ventilator.

56
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:08,060
I won't be able to breathe without it.

57
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,060
It's not others I'm helping.

58
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,900
I do it to keep breathing.

59
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,060
I'm helping myself.

60
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,499
Stay off the streets alone at night.

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,340
I'm worried about someone coming after you.

62
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,699
Let them.

63
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,380
We won't go down without a fight.

64
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,739
Unbelievable.

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,738
Seoul

66
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:39,739
Here.

67
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,859
It was delivered from overseas.

68
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,179
They're the materials sent from Cotaya.

69
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,418
I thought you should go through them first...

70
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,220
since you were there.

71
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,578
Detective Jang

72
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,940
Detective Jang?

73
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:56,460
That's the name of a very sharp investigator.

74
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:00,819
Do Gi.

75
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:03,899
I brought some coffee.

76
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,739
I need your advice.

77
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,859
I have lots of younger brothers.

78
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,818
Recently,

79
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,460
they've been getting beaten up. And a lot.

80
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,149
But I just couldn't figure out why he beat up my brothers.

81
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,150
It's not like they have a grudge.

82
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:25,270
So I'll befriend him.

83
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,220
Maybe I can figure them out that way.

84
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,059
What do you think?

85
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,340
Could he and I be friends?

86
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:39,830
- No. - Why not?

87
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,538
Won't it be enough if I ask to be his friend?

88
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,499
That guy will go on beating up your brothers.

89
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
That really won't do.

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,379
Do Gi. Can I use your toilet?

91
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,580
Do Gi crossed the line way too far.

92
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:17,179
It's taking you a while to find the toilet.

93
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,900
Do Gi, what's wrong with me today?

94
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,299
I had an important appointment, but I only just remembered.

95
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,270
And our conversation was just getting interesting.

96
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,379
It's all right. We'll find the time some other day.

97
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm sorry about this, Do Gi.

98
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,979
Taxi Driver 2

99
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,260
Hop in. I'll drive you.

100
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,260
I also have something to say.

101
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:17,859
Vacant

102
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,460
What is it that you needed to say?

103
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,140
An official document was sent by the Cotaya police.

104
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:44,859
Of course, you were aware of it.

105
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,058
Why didn't you tell me though?

106
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:50,820
Until when are you going to keep up this childish act?

107
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:52,659
Don't you get...

108
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,260
what they're trying to find in Cotaya?

109
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,539
Me.

110
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,900
It's me they're looking for.

111
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,660
And you probably knew that, Mr. Hyun Jo.

112
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,339
So let me ask again.

113
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,939
Why didn't you inform me?

114
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,100
Did it trigger your inferiority complex?

115
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
What?

116
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,019
You've lost it, haven't you?

117
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,299
The bishop being fond of you must've gone to your head,

118
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,059
but you're nothing but a guard dog.

119
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,899
I didn't think people actually said such things out loud.

120
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,100
I'm warning you.

121
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,460
Tread lightly.

122
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,939
I will.

123
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,619
Seoul Metropolitan Police

124
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,299
Warmhearted and Trustworthy Seoul Police

125
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,820
Not so fast. You should pay the fare.

126
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:58,820
You crazy mutt.

127
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,460
Manager On, be safe on the road.

128
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:10,419
Sir!

129
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:11,819
- Sir! - Good morning,

130
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
Senior Superintendent Park.

131
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,580
But I was taught not to give free taxi rides.

132
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,580
Seoul Metropolitan Police

133
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,820
Have the report made by today.

134
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,259
Go on.

135
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,858
- Invite him in. - Sir?

136
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:55,018
Manager On, you...

137
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,219
You were just bitten by the guard dog,

138
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,060
so call it in already.

139
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,430
Are you all right?

140
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,060
Don't come in.

141
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,898
I'm fine. Get back to work.

142
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:04,979
Yes, sir.

143
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,220
The Police of the People, a Just South Korea

144
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:12,429
See?

145
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,859
You have so much to protect.

146
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,550
All around you are things that could easily shatter.

147
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:24,259
So here's my warning.

148
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,220
Tread lightly.

149
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,189
Why aren't you saying it back?

150
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,139
I said it earlier, didn't I?

151
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,700
Tread lightly.

152
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,940
I will.

153
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,700
If you come across any Intel about me,

154
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,379
let me know immediately.

155
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:55,499
Don't make judgement calls yourself.

156
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,019
Got it?

157
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,139
Sure.

158
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:16,779
The current wind speed is 2m s.

159
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,899
The 500 won coin weighs 7.7g.

160
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,190
The target is about 3.5m away.

161
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,619
Calculating that with gravity as well as the force of my arm...

162
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,739
Throw it at a 35-degree angle.

163
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:30,899
- My gosh. - No way.

164
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,189
You're a professional at this.

165
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,978
How can one be this good at coin-tossing?

166
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:37,139
As you know, I have nimble hands.

167
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,819
Gyeong Gu, you're the only one left.

168
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,499
I'd rather sit this round out.

169
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,979
You can't.

170
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:44,429
- Right? - Toss it already.

171
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,550
Mr. Kim, are you good at coin-tossing?

172
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,940
- No. - But you'll do better than me.

173
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:51,618
It's my last coin.

174
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,549
I have to get to work though.

175
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,460
Just toss it in the circle for me.

176
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,060
There?

177
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,340
What?

178
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:05,779
What the...

179
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:10,138
No way. That's cheating.

180
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,139
What do you mean?

181
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,978
But that wasn't your coin. It was Mr. Kim's.

182
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,419
I gave him that coin...

183
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,618
which makes it mine.

184
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:20,258
If that were true, these wouldn't be our coins...

185
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:22,658
since we got them from our passengers.

186
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:23,939
They still belong to them.

187
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,379
Look at you raising your voice at me.

188
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,018
That is not the same thing!

189
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,419
Either way, that coin is mine.

190
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,378
No, it's not yours.

191
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:33,499
What are you doing out here?

192
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:35,059
Good. Go Eun can be the referee.

193
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,099
- You can't complain. - Tell that to yourself.

194
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,379
Go Eun, tell us who's right.

195
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,779
Were you loafing around during working hours?

196
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:49,420
No, of course not. We had time on our hands, so...

197
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:56,858
You're the worst, you know.

198
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:58,539
- Me? - You're...

199
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,979
Get to work already!

200
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,659
- Thank you. - Have a good day.

201
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,259
Gosh, I'm late.

202
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,339
- Welcome. - Jeil Chakhan Hospital, please.

203
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,379
Sure.

204
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,378
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

205
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,219
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

206
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,299
Stop the operations that kill people!

207
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,579
Murderer Ahn Young Sook

208
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,019
Bring my daughter back!

209
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:31,700
Punish the murderer.

210
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,498
Here you go.

211
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:39,019
- I received your credit card. - Yes.

212
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:51,819
Thank you.

213
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,700
Director Ahn Young Sook, the murderer.

214
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Reveal the truth.

215
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,179
Bring my daughter back!

216
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,339
- He's ruining our quiet mornings. - Director Ahn Young Sook.

217
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,978
- Should I tell him to stop? - Take responsibility...

218
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,220
- and resign. - No, don't.

219
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,899
- They say he's harbouring weapons. - Director Ahn Young Sook.

220
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:09,939
I don't mind the noise,

221
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,299
- but he stinks. - Stop the operations...

222
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,299
- It's driving me crazy. - that kill people.

223
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,019
Director Ahn Young Sook...

224
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,499
shouldn't be a doctor!

225
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:24,060
What is this?

226
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,300
It seems like you haven't eaten.

227
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,259
Why don't you grab a meal...

228
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:31,379
and head to a sauna?

229
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,498
Do you see me as a beggar? I don't need this.

230
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:35,858
What was that?

231
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,699
That is not how you respond to people's kindness.

232
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,498
Kindness? When she murdered a person?

233
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:43,658
The court already found her to be innocent.

234
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,579
That's because you people lied!

235
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,220
What do you mean we lied?

236
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,979
Show us proof if you want to accuse us.

237
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,580
Don't.

238
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,820
Yes.

239
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,659
You can protest all you want,

240
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,460
but many people walk past this place.

241
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,659
Couldn't you perhaps refrain from using the megaphone?

242
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,499
For whose benefit?

243
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,739
What happened to Ms. Han Su Ryeon...

244
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,060
was also an unfortunate case for me.

245
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,459
But there are some things in life that happen unexpectedly.

246
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,779
That's nonsense! You did this.

247
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,738
I'm not saying I didn't, but...

248
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,619
Director, you should head inside.

249
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:28,940
Then...

250
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,340
Take this with you!

251
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,259
"Director Ahn Young Sook,"

252
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:45,060
"stop the operations that kill people!"

253
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:49,060
Who will be at loss if Director Ahn...

254
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,499
quits her surgeries?

255
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,700
Do you know how many people she operates a day?

256
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,979
As if I don't know that you're all in on it.

257
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,858
The truth will eventually come out.

258
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,820
The truth? The court already ruled in our favour!

259
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:09,180
No doctor operates on people to kill them.

260
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,420
They do it to save lives!

261
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,940
If Dr. Ahn is guilty,

262
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,339
it'll be for trying her best...

263
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,339
to save people like you.

264
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,820
Let me tell you this once again.

265
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,940
We didn't fabricate any evidence,

266
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,059
and we have nothing to hide!

267
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,180
You fabricated nothing, and you have nothing to hide?

268
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
As if!

269
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,378
This qualifies as an assault,

270
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,379
and I heard you were on probation.

271
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,580
Hit me, then.

272
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,340
Darn it!

273
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,540
Darn!

274
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,258
No one on the force...

275
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,940
requested the material from Cotaya.

276
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,499
But someone must've received it.

277
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:08,579
It was sent to the prosecutors' office,

278
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,060
but the recipient doesn't work there.

279
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,940
So let me get this straight.

280
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:18,379
This Detective Jang who isn't on the police force...

281
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:19,819
requested material to be sent...

282
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,499
to someone who doesn't work at the prosecutors' office,

283
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,019
and now a taxi driver has it.

284
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,739
You're right about me quitting these childish games.

285
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:33,059
The trail ends there, so there's no way of knowing...

286
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,820
We'll know once we bait them to come up to the surface.

287
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,019
Senior Superintendent Park Hyun Jo

288
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,700
How would you do that?

289
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,659
There's no excuse to open an investigation.

290
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,460
I didn't mean we'd do it your way.

291
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,619
- I want pork cutlet. - I want jjamppong and rice.

292
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:50,939
I already ate, and I'm full.

293
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,580
- He must've eaten. - He already ate?

294
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
I see he doesn't skip meals.

295
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:55,859
- What should we have? - Stir-fried pork and wrap.

296
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,820
We'll do it their way.

297
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,460
- Let's go to the restroom. - The restroom?

298
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,300
- What the... - Shoot.

299
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,899
Hey!

300
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,020
You should apologize after bumping into someone.

301
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,020
Why won't you apologize?

302
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:21,510
Darn it.

303
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,820
Unbelievable.

304
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:29,750
Why do I even bother?

305
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:32,219
Deluxe Taxi Service - Don't die, get revenge. We'll do it for you.

306
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,990
Tell us your stories of injustice.

307
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:40,300
Tell us your stories of injustice.

308
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:48,939
Hello?

309
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,659
Where are you right now?

310
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:01,060
Deluxe

311
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,619
Deluxe

312
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,219
Please tell me...

313
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,219
your story.

314
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,659
A medical malpractice case?

315
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,218
To be honest, I'm slightly confused.

316
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:51,270
What's confusing about this?

317
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:53,510
It's true that she was operated on.

318
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:55,780
I guess, but...

319
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,378
1 year ago

320
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:04,580
Surgery Waiting Room

321
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,699
Thankfully, the director will be doing your surgery.

322
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,938
She has been on TV a lot and is famous,

323
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:14,619
so there's no need for you to be worried.

324
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,059
They say it's not even a major surgery.

325
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,750
It'll be over in a few hours, and you can go home today.

326
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:21,820
So don't worry about a thing.

327
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,060
- But Dad... - What is it? Tell me.

328
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,459
I want fish-shaped buns.

329
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:31,020
Once you're out of surgery, I'll buy you a whole bucket of them.

330
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,139
- Got it. - Good.

331
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,340
Su Ryeon, how are you feeling today?

332
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,780
I'm good.

333
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:45,820
The surgery will take about three hours.

334
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,580
Don't worry too much, Mr. Han.

335
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:53,580
What's wrong?

336
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,340
- It's nothing. I hope it goes well. - Sure thing.

337
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,989
Let us head inside, then.

338
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,379
Good luck!

339
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,379
- I'll be back. - Sure thing.

340
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Good luck!

341
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:08,619

Operating Room Status: Han Su Ryeon, Out of surgery

349
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:49,750
Su Ryeon.

350
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,659
My gosh. Su Ryeon...

351
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:56,619
Su Ryeon's surgery was successful.

352
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,820
Thank you.

353
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,658
When she wakes up in the recovery room,

354
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,539
she'll be moved to the general ward.

355
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,340
- Thank you so much, doctor. - My pleasure.

356
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:07,990
Su Ryeon.

357
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,698
- But... - Gosh, you startled me.

358
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,659
Han Su Ryeon never woke up.

359
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,819
His one and only daughter is in a coma,

360
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,059
so how could he not be furious?

361
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,218
- Director Ahn! - Director Ahn already left.

362
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:28,059
She's not inside.

363
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,458
I know she's here, and I must see her.

364
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,698
Mr. Han, I'm the one you need to talk to.

365
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,989
I'm in charge of settling the compensation.

366
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,779
Director Ahn took out a liability insurance,

367
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,099
so you will be compensated!

368
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,059
This isn't about the compensation.

369
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,139
What on earth did you do to my daughter?

370
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,618
Look here. If you keep this up,

371
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:46,269
I will have you arrested for disrupting our work.

372
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,418
Go ahead. Call the police!

373
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,939
I want to know what happened in the OR that day.

374
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,780
- Move, you punks! - Sir, please.

375
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:55,739
- Director Ahn! - Hey!

376
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,059
- You can't do this. - Let go of me.

377
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,260
Rainbow Transport

378
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:03,658
But it was concluded that there was no foul play in the trial.

379
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,379
Come on. Are you taking turns? Why are you two bothering me?

380
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:11,579
Based on the anaesthesiologist's notes,

381
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,459
the surgery records, and the nursing chart,

382
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:15,658
one can confirm that all of the medical activities...

383
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,139
during the surgery were carried out with legitimate reasons.

384
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:19,820
I swear...

385
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,819
I smelled alcohol from Director Ahn Young Sook.

386
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,899
Defendant

387
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,379
Do you have proof?

388
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,500
I smelled it myself.

389
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,379
I'm telling the truth.

390
00:22:29,939 --> 00:22:31,739
According to the statements of your acquaintances,

391
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,418
you were the one with the drinking problem.

392
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,539
What...

393
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,418
As you can see in the evidence we submitted,

394
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:39,658
the surgery had gone well.

395
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,579
But given that the patient didn't wake up from anaesthesia,

396
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,138
one could easily deduce that...

397
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,618
the cause of the patient's unconsciousness...

398
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:47,099
must be the side effect of the anaesthesia,

399
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,579
which must be relevant to her constitution.

400
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,698
And 1 out of 10,000 patients suffer from the side effect of anaesthesia.

401
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:53,059
Given the progress of medicine,

402
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,379
this is considered an uncontrollable variable.

403
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:57,939
It's one of the unfortunate causes that lead to medical accidents.

404
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
That is all.

405
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:08,500
The court is ready to make a ruling.

406
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:10,339
The plaintiff requested to see...

407
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,019
the security footage of the operating room.

408
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,458
But unfortunately, the computer was formatted,

409
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,898
so no security footage could be retrieved.

410
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:17,019
However, hospitals are not obligated to keep such footage.

411
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,218
And seeing how the computer has been formatted on a regular basis...

412
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:21,418
for several years,

413
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,019
the absence of security footage...

414
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,019
cannot be considered as grounds for concealment or manipulation.

415
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,699
Therefore, the case has been dismissed.

416
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
Good work.

417
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:00,618
There's a victim, but no one is responsible.

418
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:03,339
Gosh. This is an odd case.

419
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,418
There are victims, but no one is held responsible...

420
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:07,500
especially at these two places.

421
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,139
Military and hospitals.

422
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,260
It must mean it's that much harder to uncover the truth there.

423
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:14,739
The client is obligated to prove malpractice.

424
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,618
But all the evidence is at the hospital.

425
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:19,619
He probably couldn't have done much without their cooperation.

426
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,939
What do we know about Director Ahn Young Sook?

427
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,379
"A picture is worth a thousand words."

428
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,659
Would you like to go see her?

429
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:33,619
She's not that far from here.

430
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,179
Did you find her? She must be in your vicinity.

431
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,859
GPS Tracker

432
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,259
Beware of dogs

433
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,939
Please make sure to take them regularly.

434
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,139
That's great. Bye.

435
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:00,659
Gosh.

436
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,540
- Thank you. - Sure.

437
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:05,739
Please take good care of your health.

438
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,899
Thank you.

439
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,819
She's been treating senior citizens who live alone in that area...

440
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,139
every weekend as a part of her major project.

441
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:18,339
Gosh. Not just that area. She's covering the entire district.

442
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,340
That's amazing, right?

443
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,020
What else?

444
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,898
Director Ahn Young Sook Performs the Most Surgeries This Year

445
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:29,540
She's famous for performing a lot of surgery.

446
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
Well,

447
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,979
they are uncomfortable by your presence.

448
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,178
Could you not take pictures here?

449
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:37,259
Okay.

450
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,179
Thank you for your cooperation.

451
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,579
She has a business agreement with each borough office.

452
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,020
And she's listed as the doctor at the local welfare center.

453
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:48,819
Other than these activities, she's a professor at a med school.

454
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,938
She's also a consultant...

455
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:51,379
with an insurance company for traffic accidents.

456
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:54,618
She's on the committee that handles medical disputes and so on.

457
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,299
She's on a lot of projects.

458
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,739
We're about done here. Let's go to the next neighbourhood.

459
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,139
- Okay. - Let's go.

460
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,060
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

461
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,020
Hello.

462
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,619
I see. Yes. Was that today?

463
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,499
I forgot.

464
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,740
Yes. I'll call you back right away.

465
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,259
I feel awful.

466
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,618
I forgot that I had an interview scheduled today.

467
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,699
I see.

468
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:24,979
- Use this for your meal... - Gosh, that's all right.

469
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,378
We can pay for our own meals.

470
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:28,458
You are doing this for free too.

471
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,378
This isn't a lot.

472
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:31,698
Please use it for your meal.

473
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:33,218
- Gosh. - Thank you for your help.

474
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:35,300
- Sure. Bye. - Bye.

475
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,260
It's just as you said.

476
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,139
"A picture is worth a thousand words."

477
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,979
See?

478
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,419
Listen to me, and you'll never be disappointed.

479
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,419
Hello.

480
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:07,820
- To Jeil Chakhan Hospital, please. - Sure.

481
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:12,819
Deluxe

482
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,699
Can you turn on the radio?

483
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,898
The senior citizens from that area have a special nickname for you.

484
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:21,780
You're known as the Schweitzer of Shanty Towns.

485
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,740
Do you like your nickname?

486
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,178
Gosh, I'm not the only one helping the senior citizens.

487
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,779
There are also other volunteers.

488
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,779
All of us are working together to help them.

489
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,859
They deserve all the credit, not me.

490
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,019
You see patients, perform surgery,

491
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,019
star on TV, and do volunteer work.

492
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,980
You couldn't have done all of these unless you were in good shape.

493
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,779
How much longer do you plan to volunteer at the shanty towns?

494
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,218
I don't plan such things.

495
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:49,059
I just want to help them as long as my strength allows me.

496
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,138
You can trust her just by listening to her voice, right?

497
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:53,378
This was an interview with Schweitzer of Shanty Towns,

498
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:56,499
Director Ahn Young Sook of Jeil Chakhan Hospital.

499
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,059
Thank you for joining us despite your busy schedule.

500
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,500
Thank you for having me.

501
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:12,980
I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I listened to your conversation.

502
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:14,819
You do a lot of good deeds.

503
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,500
It's an honour to have you in my taxi.

504
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,500
By the way, I recently dropped off a customer at your hospital.

505
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,659
But a man was protesting alone in front of the hospital.

506
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,218
He was demanding to know the truth...

507
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:34,939
and screaming. He was pretty loud.

508
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,820
Sir.

509
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:41,060
I'm sorry, but I would appreciate a quiet ride.

510
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,060
I see. I'm sorry. I was inconsiderate.

511
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,619
I'll be quiet now.

512
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,939
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

513
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,899
Here.

514
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,219
I'll run your card.

515
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,099
In process

516
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,260
Payment complete

517
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:30,300
Credit card statement

518
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:40,099
If what our client said was true,

519
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,458
and if he really smelled alcohol from her in front of the OR,

520
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:44,500
it must mean that she loves drinking.

521
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
Go on.

522
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:49,020
But she mostly goes to coffee shops and restaurants.

523
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,859
She doesn't go to bars at all.

524
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,059
- Here. - How's the surgical wound?

525
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,579
Gosh. Does it hurt?

526
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,659
You operated on me. It shouldn't hurt.

527
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,779
I have no family.

528
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,899
But you still fixed me up for free.

529
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:05,819
Don't skip your meals.

530
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,820
And you cannot drink alcohol.

531
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:10,419
I have only been receiving help from you without giving back.

532
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,339
This is all I could offer. I apologize.

533
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,698
Gosh, it's all right. You should drink it.

534
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:18,458
Don't leave me hanging. Please accept this.

535
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:21,698
- Then I'll gladly accept it. - Okay.

536
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:23,980
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

537
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,379
I set up all the medical equipment you requested.

538
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,378
I see. Thank you.

539
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,339
Shall we get going now?

540
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,218
- Okay. Rest up, sir. - Bye.

541
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:36,299
Get well soon.

542
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,779
- Okay. - Get well soon.

543
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,899
He's such a kindhearted man.

544
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,780
Right.

545
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,459
I heard you recently bought a new car.

546
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,139
Gosh. It's a tiny car.

547
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,339
Well, I have Director Ahn to thank. She's been so good to me.

548
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,019
Gosh. I didn't do anything.

549
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,339
You could buy a new car because you had been frugal.

550
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,779
Gosh, no.

551
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,899
Then I'll buy coffee for everyone today!

552
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:02,379
- Gosh. - Let's go.

553
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,979
Everyone speaks so highly of her, and she's well-respected.

554
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,139
This is such a heartwarming scene. What's this about?

555
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,980
Did our client lie?

556
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Han Jae Duk, Han Su Ryeon, Ahn Young Sook

557
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,740
I knew it. It's still confusing.

558
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:21,899
Still?

559
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:24,859
Do you think our client is lying to us?

560
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,259
That's not what I said.

561
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,659
It's not, right?

562
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,859
But to be honest, I'm not sure either.

563
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,819
Here's a thing about surgery.

564
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,458
When a patient is between life and death,

565
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:37,938
at times, doctors must risk it and take the dangerous path...

566
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,219
to save the patient's life.

567
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,580
What do you think, Kim?

568
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,658
I'm not sure if this is an accident caused by a mistake...

569
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:49,580
or if this is a case of medical malpractice.

570
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:52,939
I can't be certain either.

571
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,859
If her death was accidental or just bad luck,

572
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,139
is it right to accept this case?

573
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:07,779
I don't think we should take this case.

574
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,980
What do you think?

575
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:16,020
- Okay. - Sure.

576
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Okay.

577
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:24,619
Insert coin

578
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,419
Excuse me. May I borrow a coin?

579
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,980
I don't have any change on me.

580
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,980
- Do you want this coffee? - Is that for me?

581
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:07,100
Sure. Thanks.

582
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,500
This coffee has a lot of cream and sugar.

583
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,740
It means I like it.

584
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:26,739
That's the document from a lawsuit. Was that your case?

585
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,939
Do you want me to take a look?

586
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:32,419
Right. I should introduce myself.

587
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,139
Take it. That's my business card.

588
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,059
Since you gave me a cup of coffee,

589
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,939
as a way to thank you for the coffee,

590
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,300
I can take a look.

591
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:45,499
You're looking for answers too.

592
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,300
So it won't hurt.

593
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,740
Why do you think I'm looking for answers?

594
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:53,859
I didn't have to think. I could see it...

595
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,339
It was written all over your face.

596
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,219
"I'm looking for answers." That's what it said.

597
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,979
What brings you here?

598
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,339
I came to find my belonging.

599
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,499
I forgot my bag inside a taxi.

600
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,539
I got here faster than my belonging. So I'm waiting for it now.

601
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,580
I see.

602
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,818
Come on. Don't be shy. Give that to me.

603
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:14,940
- I... - I'll take a look.

604
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,980
Ruling

605
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,139
The ruling. And there's...

606
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,540
This was a tough case.

607
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,138
The plaintiff had to prove that...

608
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,388
the defendant was guilty in the trial.

609
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,019
But the defendant had all the records.

610
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,619
And the defendant wouldn't hand over any files...

611
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:39,699
that would put the defendant in jeopardy.

612
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,299
The defendant had an upper hand from the get-go.

613
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,219
Thank you for the advice.

614
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:50,619
Hold on. The defendant had one more advantage from the get-go.

615
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,580
Gosh. This guy...

616
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,060
probably didn't have anyone on his side from the get-go.

617
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:03,659
That's what crossed my mind.

618
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:08,059
Working at the noisy construction site for years...

619
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,460
must have caused his voice to get louder and hoarse too.

620
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:14,738
Regular people like us might find his voice...

621
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:15,980
rather aggressive.

622
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:19,460
Unlike the briefcases office workers carry,

623
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:21,658
his work bag...

624
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:24,019
must have been filled with tools that may have looked like weapons.

625
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,868
So people must have found him even more violent.

626
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:28,388
People seem nice when they're clean, but not so nice when they're dirty.

627
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:29,540
But you see,

628
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,099
people like him must carry out physically exhausting tasks...

629
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,500
in hazardous environments.

630
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,818
Just because they can't articulate in a sophisticated tone,

631
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:40,218
diminishing their value...

632
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:43,299
is wrong. Don't you agree?

633
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,219
I noticed something about you.

634
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:50,979
You're quite reserved.

635
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,819
Have you noticed that I'm the only one talking here?

636
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,658
You were giving me valuable advice.

637
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,258
So I was listening to you intently.

638
00:35:58,259 --> 00:35:59,339
I see.

639
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,299
You have a great voice. And you're handsome.

640
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,979
By the way, I have a question. When you operate taxis,

641
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,579
you and your customers must talk about...

642
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,060
the hardships of their lives.

643
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:13,980
Well, it comes with the job.

644
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,060
Then among your customers,

645
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,939
there must be people who need legal advice.

646
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,059
Or there must be people with problems law cannot resolve.

647
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,540
What do you think about talking about such customers in depth?

648
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,499
It sounds like you want me to introduce them to you.

649
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,540
Oh, my. You catch on fast.

650
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,739
But if you do introduce me to your customers,

651
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,429
I will give you half of my fee.

652
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,908
Chun Ji Hoon Law Firm, Fee: One dollar

653
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:42,868
It says your fee is only a dollar.

654
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:46,259
It's easy to be generous when you're wealthy.

655
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,698
But giving away half of my fee when it's only a mere dollar...

656
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:51,698
is a difficult thing.

657
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:53,940
And that's the offer I'm making.

658
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:56,499
I'll think about it.

659
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,259
Think about that case of yours too.

660
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:00,819
Have a good day. You're handsome.

661
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,389
Gosh. But where's the taxi?

662
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:22,429
Traffic camera for traffic violations and speeding

663
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,659
Vacant

664
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:35,940
Tell the truth behind your lies and manipulation!

665
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:44,060
Bring my daughter back!

666
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:48,540
Punish the murderer.

667
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,219
We will take care of you like family.

668
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,739
How dare she treat patients after ruining my daughter's life?

669
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,869
Taxi Stop

670
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:25,020
I don't want the old ones.

671
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:27,540
Give me the ones that just came out of the pan.

672
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:31,339
You told me that a few times. So I'm only giving you fresh ones.

673
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,819
Fish-shaped Buns

674
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:39,219
Intensive Care Unit

675
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:47,099
Bukbu University Hospital

676
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,139
Bukbu University Hospital

677
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:18,139
On your marks.

678
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:22,500
Good.

679
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:35,139
Han Su Ryeon

680
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:39,979
- Dad. - Are you all right?

681
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,060
- When did you get here? - Just now.

682
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,020
What's that?

683
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:46,908
- The fish-shaped buns. - Are you done?

684
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:49,619
Yes. What is this? You said you couldn't make it today.

685
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,619
I cancelled work. I wanted to see you.

686
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,869
I'm sure it was the other way around.

687
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:56,139
- Let's go. Give me your bag. - Okay.

688
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:00,619
- No way. This looks so good. - Eat up.

689
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:05,259
Carpentry, plasterwork, finishing work, plumbing, repairs

690
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,258
I looked into it.

691
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:10,979
But if you take good care of yourself,

692
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,299
you can finish physical rehab in six months.

693
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:15,020
I'm fine, Dad.

694
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,619
No. You're not fine. You should get the surgery.

695
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:22,020
I'll probably be okay with more physical therapy.

696
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:25,979
The doctor said delaying it would only worsen your condition.

697
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,218
And I saw you run earlier.

698
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:29,179
You've delayed it as much as you could.

699
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:33,219
I'm scared of getting the surgery.

700
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,869
You can get the driver's license during rehab.

701
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,338
Once you get the license,

702
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,298
I can buy you a used car.

703
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,698
We can go on a trip together too.

704
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,698
Really? Once I get my driver's license,

705
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:46,939
we can go to the east coast just like old times...

706
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,659
and go to the silver grass field. What do you think?

707
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,540
I can drive us there.

708
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:53,389
Just the thought of that makes me happy.

709
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,429
Su Ryeon.

710
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:30,060
This guy...

711
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:35,540
probably didn't have anyone on his side from the get-go.

712
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,500
That crossed my mind.

713
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,460
Bukbu University Hospital

714
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,019
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

715
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,178
Murderer Ahn Young Sook

716
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:57,429
How dare she treat patients after ruining my daughter's life?

717
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:02,259
Right. It makes sense that we can't be certain.

718
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,699
That's only natural.

719
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:18,299
Hey, Go Eun.

720
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,500
I'll give you a surprise present.

721
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:23,778
A present? What is it?

722
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:25,869
If I tell you now, it's not a surprise.

723
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:29,429
Gosh.

724
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:31,939
All right. Let's wipe the stairs.

725
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,500
Staircase

726
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,869
What's going on? Hurry up!

727
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,389
Control Room, Restricted Area

728
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:00,339
Right. Everyone doesn't feel right about this case.

729
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:01,980
I can solve that.

730
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:06,739
Completed

731
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:10,500
That wasn't hard.

732
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:21,909
What are you doing here, Go Eun?

733
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,819
Darn it. You scared me.

734
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:25,460
Why are you here?

735
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:27,259
For the same reason you're here.

736
00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:32,619
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

737
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,060
Squeaky Clean Brothers

738
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:39,020
Candy?

739
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:41,219
Nice.

740
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,860
- This definitely woke me up. - I told you.

741
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,939
This is nice.

742
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,218
Anyway, our client is so caught up in this incident and can't move on.

743
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:54,219
Exactly.

744
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:57,940
Wouldn't whatever we find be useful somehow?

745
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,219
That's what I thought too.

746
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:01,779
It's not polite to just sit and watch.

747
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,540
Look at that. Her fingers are a blur.

748
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,298
If everyone wants something concrete,

749
00:44:22,299 --> 00:44:24,338
it's only right to find it for you.

750
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:25,738
- Isn't it? - It is.

751
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:27,338
We want it!

752
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:29,259
Find it for us!

755
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:59,739
If we find just one hint that they faked their evidence,

756
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,138
- it's game over. - Game over!

757
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:04,499
Right. How dare they try to dupe us?

758
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,460
Our Go Eun can't be duped.

759
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,619
Ahn Young Sook.

760
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:15,539
I'll find proof you faked the evidence and expose you.

761
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,420
- Expose you. - Expose you.

00:45:29,299 --> 00:45:30,819

No information

765
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:40,738
No information

766
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,779
No. It was all in vain.

767
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,580
There's nothing at all.

768
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:50,139
What is this? It's pointless.

769
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:52,819
What on earth is this?

770
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,659
Mr. Kim

771
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:04,298
Hello?

772
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:07,020
Didn't you say you'd give me a surprise gift?

773
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,659
Surprise!

774
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,900
There's nothing. How's that for a surprise?

775
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:14,819
I was surprised myself to find nothing.

776
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:18,178
Everyone seemed to feel bad about it,

777
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:20,859
so I looked everywhere to find some kind of proof,

778
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,419
but I failed.

779
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,779
I just wasted my time.

780
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,779
Bear with me. I'll be there soon.

781
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:28,619
"Soon?"

782
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:31,219
Where are you right now?

783
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:32,699
Nearby.

784
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,460
Nearby?

785
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:43,299
Away for a short while

786
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,138
Out of the Office

787
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,659
Oh, dear. We'd agreed not to take this case.

788
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:55,619
They really don't listen.

789
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,500
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

790
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:09,659
I came to find out if it was an accident or an incident.

791
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:15,460
We got Han Su Ryeon's chart from the data server.

792
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,939
Yes, but Ahn Young Sook filled in a chart by hand...

793
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,419
when she saw a patient.

794
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,819
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

795
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:26,299
They transferred that to the server later.

796
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:32,298
Oh, so you want to check...

797
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:34,579
if they left something out in the transfer?

798
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,060
Medical records to be kept on site.

799
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,258
March and April, 2021

800
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:46,059
If they'd faked their records that way,

801
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,818
would they have kept the handwritten charts?

802
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:49,659
I'd have destroyed them.

803
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:55,299
Medical records must be kept for ten years by law.

804
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,060
She couldn't destroy them easily.

805
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,420
Medical records to be kept on site.

806
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:18,420
Medical Records

807
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:26,020
Medical Records: Han Su Ryeon

808
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:33,939
Medical Records: Han Su Ryeon

809
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,940
I found Han Su Ryeon's file.

810
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:38,739
You found it?

811
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,299
You were right, Go Eun.

812
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,060
Medical Records

813
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:48,979
From 2 years ago...

814
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,940
Now that I saw this, I have to look into it.

815
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,580
What do you mean?

816
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,020
There's a saying.

817
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,540
The scene...

818
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,900
holds the truth.

823
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:20,339
The scene you talked about is the operating room?

824
00:49:20,739 --> 00:49:22,738
If you can't find anything,

825
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:25,339
it doesn't hurt to check out where it all began.

826
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:27,379
You'll go in there?

827
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,819
There are no cameras inside, so I have no choice.

828
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,020
I must go inside and look.

829
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,298
How did you know there are no cameras in the OR?

830
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:36,219
We'd have seen them if there were any.

831
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,619
There's no camera you can't get into.

832
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,818
How will you get inside?

833
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:46,500
They won't let outsiders in.

834
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:47,900
That works just fine.

835
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:50,380
I wasn't thinking of ringing a bell.

836
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,579

838
00:50:04,259 --> 00:50:05,900
Let's head to the OR.

839
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,299
Did you not eat as told?

840
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,500
Oh, dear.

841
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,299
Are you all right?

842
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,738
Are you headed to the OR?

843
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:18,500
Yes, we are.

844
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:21,499
But we can handle it just fine.

845
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,699
I was on my way there.

846
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,100
I see...

847
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,500
Jeil Chakhan Hospital

848
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,060
You must be new here, doctor.

849
00:50:37,259 --> 00:50:39,860
You haven't seen me before? I saw you a few times.

850
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,460
You have?

851
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,500
I don't really remember.

852
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,939
Which department are you in?

853
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,100
I'm disappointed.

854
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,900
I'm upset. I won't tell.

855
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,139
Here we go.

00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:57,738

We'll take it from here. Thank you.

861
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:07,698
- Take care. - Bye.

00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:08,900

863
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,940
Oh, I remember.

00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:51,100
Mr. Kim, get out of there.

870
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:53,539
Did I set off this alarm?

871
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,539
I think there's a radio detector.

872
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,739
Get out right now.

873
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,460
What's going on?

874
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,259
Is it a camera?

875
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,500
Open the door.

876
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,940
Here you go.

877
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:09,619
Authorized Personnel Only

878
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:15,699
You two, stand guard outside and don't let anyone in.

Authorized Personnel Only

880
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,580
Gather around, everyone.

881
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,698
I told you all many times.

882
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:37,219
Who brought a camera in here?

883
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,019
What if you were a patient here?

884
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,100
Would you want someone to have a video of your surgery?

885
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,658
Step forward.

886
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:51,540
Who brought a camera in?

887
00:52:57,179 --> 00:53:00,500
The alarm shut down. I guess it was a sensor malfunction.

888
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,019
- Check their belongings. - Okay.

889
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,859
Show me what's in your pockets.

890
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,298
Check the lockers too.

891
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:09,380
- Okay. - Never mind.

892
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,980
I'll do that.

893
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:28,940
Cleaning Supplies

894
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,980
Darn it.

895
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,860
Why did the alarm go off again?

896
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:24,659
I guess the sensor really is broken.

897
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:28,380
Let's wrap this up and prepare for surgery.

898
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,980
Okay.

899
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,339
Go on inside and set things up in the OR.

900
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,940
Cleaning Supplies

901
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:00,339
It's all fine.

902
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,540
Why do they have a camera detector?

903
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:10,779
I bet they set it up because of me.

904
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,298
I pestered the detective...

905
00:55:15,299 --> 00:55:18,580
in charge of the case every single day.

906
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:24,100
He told me that words would get me nowhere.

907
00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:29,259
That I'd need at least a video to do something.

908
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:34,179
So I took a camera into the OR.

909
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,460
They caught me before I could do anything.

910
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,739
Forced entry and trespassing?

911
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,900
They took me to court and I got probation.

912
00:55:57,259 --> 00:56:01,139
Still, the sensor caught your camera from quite a distance.

913
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:03,739
High-end equipment like that...

914
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:07,500
is really, crazy expensive.

915
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:12,019
Don't you get a strong sense she really does not want anyone...

916
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,739
to film anything in there?

917
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,899
Incident? Accident? Ahn Young Sook

918
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,059
Medical Records

919
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,778
What is this?

920
00:56:19,779 --> 00:56:22,500
It's not English or Korean. I can't read a thing.

921
00:56:23,139 --> 00:56:25,020
Is this Han Su Ryeon's chart?

922
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,659
I doubt even she can read what she wrote.

923
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:32,380
She was operated on her left femur and pelvis.

924
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,619
Why are you looking at me like that?

925
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:39,618
Mr. Choi.

926
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:41,939
I heard you did well in school. Did you study medicine?

927
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,060
Gyeong Gu.

928
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,459
How did you read this?

929
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,939
Did you really study medicine?

930
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,299
I think you're weirder.

931
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:50,618
There's a shape of a person.

932
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:51,899
There's an X right here.

933
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,619
That has to be the problem area.

934
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:55,900
- You're all so silly. - Of course, we are.

935
00:56:57,339 --> 00:56:58,980
Hey, I got it.

936
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:00,899
Did you find something?

937
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,219
Come and take a look at this.

938
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,539
This is Han Su Ryeon's medical bill.

939
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,579
Total charged: 54,069 dollars

940
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,059
My gosh. That's crazy expensive.

941
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,420
You can tell just how serious our client is, right?

942
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,219
All I can tell is that he paid a lot.

943
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:21,298
According to law, if there's an assailant,

944
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:23,699
insurance won't subsidize the medical bill.

945
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,859
As you know,

946
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,539
in our country, whether or not you have health insurance...

947
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,500
makes a huge difference in the bill.

948
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,139
If this were a mere accident where no one is responsible,

949
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,380
he could've made an insurance claim.

950
00:57:39,179 --> 00:57:42,060
But our client refused to do so.

951
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:44,259
At the expense of taking out a loan.

952
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,980
To him, there was something more important than money.

953
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,580
The truth.

954
00:57:56,179 --> 00:57:58,500
I think I have to get back in there.

955
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,100
The scene? The OR?

956
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,259
Yes, to check something.

957
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:05,499
You tried getting in there.

958
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,860
You had nowhere to hide.

959
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,219
I won't hide.

960
00:58:10,299 --> 00:58:11,339
Then what?

961
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,540
I'll just...

962
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,020
lie down.

963
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:20,218
We'll take you into surgery.

964
00:58:20,219 --> 00:58:21,980
Park Dong Sung

965
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,979
Did you not eat?

966
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:32,980
Yes.

967
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,420
Make it look like I have what Han Su Ryeon had.

968
00:58:37,819 --> 00:58:40,298
What if you get operated on by mistake?

969
00:58:40,299 --> 00:58:41,380
You'll get anaesthetized.

970
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,020
If that happens, you can figure it out for me.

971
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:50,299
See if it's an accident or an incident.

972
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,699
Deluxe

973
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,139
I'll be gentle. Don't worry.

974
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,540
- I'll be right behind you. - I'll be there waiting.

975
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,298
It's a lovely day.

976
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:17,940
I hope it goes by without any incidents...

977
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:31,739
Oh, dear.

978
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,298
- What... - Oh, my goodness.

979
00:59:38,299 --> 00:59:39,500
Oh, dear.

980
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,779
My gosh. Are you okay?

981
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,619
It's a super-wide angle lens with no blind spots.

982
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,060
The camera sensor will be up and running.

983
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,019
Turn it on three minutes after I go inside.

984
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,500
If the alarm goes off then, they'll think it's a malfunction.

985
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,339
You'll make them turn it off?

986
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,980
Our first try wasn't entirely in vain, then.

987
01:00:09,259 --> 01:00:12,259
Operation Room

988
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,540
Operation Room

989
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,420
No signal

990
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:45,659
Operating Room Status: Park Dong Sung, Awaiting surgery

991
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:56,699
Well, I'm sure nothing will go wrong.

992
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,460
No signal

993
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,339
No signal

994
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,179
Relax, sir.

995
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,980
This might smell odd.

996
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:53,020
No signal

997
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,980
Open your eyes, sir.

998
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,139
He's ready.

999
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:25,659
Didn't anyone check why he came in wearing glasses?

1000
01:02:26,299 --> 01:02:27,339
- Sorry. - Sorry.

1001
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,940
I don't care. I waited long enough.

1002
01:02:45,259 --> 01:02:46,779
Why did that go off now?

1003
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:01,659
I almost died.

1004
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:05,339
I told them to buy an expensive system.

1005
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,860
Let's begin, Dr. Gong.

1006
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:21,940
"Dr. Gong?"

1007
01:03:31,259 --> 01:03:34,619
Wait. Where did he come from?

1008
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:56,699
He's doing the operation?

1009
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:43,060
Taxi Driver 2

1010
01:04:43,219 --> 01:04:45,380
Dr. Gong. Don't you want to know...

1011
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,939
if the person who does the most operations...

1012
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:49,338
is Director Ahn...

1013
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:50,819
or Chief Gong Soo Ho?

1014
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:51,899
Have a drink.

1015
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,420
You can find surgery kits online to practice with.

1016
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,659
Why are this person's veins so ugly?

1017
01:04:57,739 --> 01:05:00,179
How can she be so calm after what she did...

1018
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,219
to a powerless old man?

1019
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:03,778
You know Han Su Ryeon, don't you?

1020
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,979
You saw him protest for over a year,

1021
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,579
and yet you kept quiet.

1022
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:08,979
When you knew everything.

1023
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,539
It was a side effect of the anaesthesia.

1024
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,658
It won't happen to me anyway.

1025
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,818
It's an unfortunate event that could happen to anyone.

1026
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:19,259
I want to make the sweet Director Ahn famous.

1027
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:20,618
Do you need a helping hand?

1028
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:22,138
I hope Director Ahn...

1029
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:23,178
Save me.

1030
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:24,298
Save me!

1031
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,819
Loves this special day of hers.

1032
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:28,779
Mr. Kim, do you hear me?

1033
01:05:28,819 --> 01:05:30,380
Go Eun?

1034
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:34,860
I told you. I'd take care of them in their own way.

1035
01:05:35,259 --> 01:05:37,100
I know Kim Do Gi the best.
