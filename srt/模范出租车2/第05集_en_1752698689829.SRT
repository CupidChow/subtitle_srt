Taxi Driver 2

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,699
All characters, organizations, and places are fictional.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,259
Some scenes of a criminal nature...

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,979
could make you feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,699
This episode features child actors.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,218
We put their safety and welfare first,

10
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,990
and filmed with guardians present.

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,819
We thank the child actors for doing so well despite the cold.

12
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,419
Go up that way.

13
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,978
- She's not here? - No. I don't see her.

14
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,619
Darn it. She's nimble for her size.

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,339
Have her mom report the kid missing.

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Okay.

17
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,179
My gosh.

18
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,140
Let's go.

19
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:01,140
Episode 5

20
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,579
Excuse me.

21
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,940
Do Gi. You live here?

22
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,470
I moved in downstairs.

23
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,380
I'd heard you lived in the area.

24
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,060
I'd have gotten something nicer if I'd known you were here.

25
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,739
Take this for now.

26
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,299
I'll treat you properly soon.

27
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,978
Do you need help moving stuff?

28
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,138
No.

29
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,630
I'll borrow a few boxes from work and that should be it.

30
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,019
Do Gi. Can I come by often?

31
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,579
Yes.

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Goodnight.

33
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:10,699
Let's see...

34
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,460
Staff Only

35
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,979
Staff Only

36
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:44,539
What's happening?

37
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,100
What's this?

38
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,579
There's something down here?

39
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,340
It looks like it'll go down but it doesn't.

40
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:23,660
Taxi Driver 2

41
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:36,660
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

42
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,299
We blocked off the elevator shaft.

43
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:41,979
Good job.

44
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,659
Can we only use this entrance from now on?

45
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,709
Yes. It'll be a hassle, but for now, let's not use the other entrance.

46
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,979
It's a real hassle.

47
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,459
Did Mr. On have to get curious and give us extra work?

48
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,900
He's still young. Let's be nice to him.

49
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,020
Okay.

50
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:00,149
He doesn't look like the type, but he causes trouble.

51
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,499
He does look like the type.

52
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,149
Are you jealous of his good looks?

53
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,299
I'm better-looking, excuse me.

54
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,619
I moved most of the bigger stuff.

55
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,019
Good. We should've moved them sooner.

56
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,580
It freed up so much space.

57
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:14,900
What about this?

58
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:19,660
Yes, that too.

59
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,059
- I'll move it. - I'll help.

60
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,900
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

61
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,830
- Let's call an expert. - We'll call an expert.

62
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:31,979
Let's move these.

63
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,900
Are you sure about it?

64
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,260
You loved them.

65
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,419
Cleaning is usually done...

66
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,900
without much thought.

67
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,059
If you consider this and that,

68
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,179
you can never throw out or change anything.

69
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,299
I ordered a large dining table.

70
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,539
Let's gather around to eat and party.

71
00:05:58,539 --> 00:05:59,619
Okay.

72
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:02,339
It would be nice if Go Eun would move in upstairs...

73
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,179
instead of living on her own.

74
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,499
She refused.

75
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:09,419
What about you? Would you like to move in?

76
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,260
I'll think about it.

77
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:34,780
Go Eun.

78
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,179
I can't seem to punch out. It must be broken.

79
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,299
It's broken?

80
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,460
Give me your card.

81
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,580
It really isn't working. It was this morning.

82
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,579
So, about that storage area.

83
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,859
It was working just fine this morning.

84
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,780
- Did you say something? - No.

85
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,260
Leave your card behind. I'll fill it in by hand.

86
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,299
Okay. I'll go home, then.

87
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,499
Bye.

88
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,580
Oh, Mr. On.

89
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,419
You moved, didn't you?

90
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,020
Yes.

91
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,660
Seoul

92
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,979
I'll tag along, Mr. Kim.

93
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,739
Didn't you say you'd go house-hunting?

94
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,139
Mr. On moved recently.

95
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,580
I asked for his help.

96
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,299
Are you dragging him along against his will?

97
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:42,900
I'm not.

98
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,059
I'm not, am I?

99
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,779
I did feel forced...

100
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,460
- until a while ago. - What?

101
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,660
I changed my mind now that Do Gi's driving.

102
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,379
I'll look thoroughly for you.

103
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,979
See? You're wrong.

104
00:07:58,859 --> 00:07:59,859
Let's go.

105
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,460
Dongmun Construction, THE EST

106
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:16,419
This place is a bit...

107
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,059
There's lots of storage space.

108
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,660
You could keep the place clean and organized.

109
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,100
Which direction does it face?

110
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,859
That faces south.

111
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,780
Warm in the winter and cool in the summer.

112
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:32,459
You look pretty young, but you know...

113
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,020
a lot about houses.

114
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,739
Will anything block the windows?

115
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,658
We designed the apartment...

116
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,019
so that the lower floors can get sunlight and a nice breeze.

117
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,310
That's nice.

118
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:49,139
Can I see the master bedroom?

119
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,340
It's this way.

120
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:56,659
I was tempted to subscribe for a place.

121
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,658
But the interest rate went up,

122
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:01,899
and I'm not sure I can pay it off with my salary.

123
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,898
Mr. Jang said he suggested you move in.

124
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,460
Why not take the second-floor room?

125
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:10,259
That would be a great arrangement for me.

126
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,550
But Mr. Jang will never get to rest.

127
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,499
He'll go grocery shopping just to feed me every day.

128
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,430
It's so obvious.

129
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,499
I agree.

130
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,460
I took a brief look.

131
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,859
It was a bit thorough to call it brief.

132
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:29,659
Okay.

133
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:31,618
But we're...

134
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,459
I'm aware your company focused on...

135
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,549
public service advertisements to find...

136
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,820
missing children or help the disadvantaged.

137
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,459
But your drivers sit behind a wheel all day...

138
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,190
and it's hard on their joints.

139
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,190
Think that you had one of these inside the car.

140
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:48,659
Wouldn't that be great?

141
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,259
- Mr. Jang. - Yes?

142
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:54,019
Car number eight needs an engine check to see if...

143
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:56,139
This!

144
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,460
Isn't this good for these?

145
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,619
See?

146
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:02,060
It's a well-known product.

147
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,018
- Is this a sample? - Yes.

148
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,099
Can I have one?

149
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,699
Yes, take all you want.

150
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,460
Really? All I want?

151
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,189
No, that's not what I meant.

152
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,060
Wait, sir! Come back!

153
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:19,940
Wait. Mr. Park.

154
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,820
Dongmun Construction

155
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:26,499
House hunting is fun, and you get freebies too.

156
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,430
You're good and thorough at checking places out.

157
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,739
I moved out pretty young and have looked at so many places.

158
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,190
When did you move out?

159
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:37,979
When you were 20?

160
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,430
When I was really young.

161
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,259
A teenager?

162
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,259
When I was really young.

163
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,139
I see.

164
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,778
The apartment below Mr. Kim's was really nice.

165
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,190
I asked about it...

166
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,139
and someone moved in just days ago.

167
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,540
The apartment below Do Gi's? Do you mean Unit 303?

168
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:04,739
How do you know?

169
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,540
No way.

170
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,899
The person who moved in beneath Mr. Kim...

171
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,659
Yes. It's me.

172
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,340
What? Mr. On!

173
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,258
- Swap with me. - I can't do that.

174
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:22,180
That's where I used to live.

175
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,858
Mr. Kim, you make a fair call.

176
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:27,498
How is that fair? I signed the contract first.

177
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,300
- Right, Do Gi? - But...

178
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:31,899
This isn't for me to get involved in.

179
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,259
Come on.

180
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,060
Sweet Mr. On, can you give in?

181
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
Then...

182
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,820
I'd rather be the not sweet Mr. On.

183
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,820
Can you not be like this?

184
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:46,699
I moved out for a bit but I was going to go back.

185
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,778
Sorry.

186
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,580
Seriously, that was my...

187
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,180
Sorry. Are you all okay?

188
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,700
I'm fine. What was that?

189
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:15,820
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

190
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,460
Are you in pain?

191
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,859
Wait, kid!

192
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,220
Kid.

193
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:38,779
Kid.

194
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,619
Kid. Come on out.

195
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,498
Kid.

196
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,019
Come back out.

197
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,019
Did I scare you?

198
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:16,499
Sorry. Were you hurt?

199
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,899
I have to go to So Mang.

200
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:36,619
Who's she?

201
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,739
She looked lost.

202
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,220
Why'd you bring her here and not to the police?

203
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,019
She didn't want to go to the police.

204
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,420
I did pass them her details, though.

205
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,180
We brought her here because Go Eun said we should,

206
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,820
- but did we do the right thing? - I'm glad she's here.

207
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:58,820
Hello.

208
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:01,979
Look at the sticker on the window.

209
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,420
We help keep kids safe

210
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,259
This is a safe place.

211
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,340
So you can relax.

212
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,540
We had that up there?

213
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,498
Do you know your mom or dad's number...

214
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:16,659
or your home address?

215
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:21,379
You can't ask her point blank like that.

216
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,899
This works better with kids.

217
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:27,139
I'll show you...

218
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,220
a magic trick.

219
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,979
This is a great trick.

220
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,499
It's clean on both sides, isn't it?

221
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,580
Watch carefully.

222
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:47,859
One,

223
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,499
two, three!

224
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:57,619
What's this?

225
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:00,939
- Ta-Da. - How did you do it?

226
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,699
- What are you doing with the kid? - Look.

227
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,739
It's magic.

228
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,060
Are you okay?

229
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,940
Are you hungry?

230
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,100
Shall we eat something? Do you like milk?

231
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,019
Drink this.

232
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,820
You don't like this? Shall I get you something else?

233
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,180
What do you like?

234
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,420
What happened?

235
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,619
I don't know why, but she was afraid of the police.

236
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,300
- She was afraid? - She lost her younger sister.

237
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,060
Her name is So Mang.

238
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,619
Hello?

239
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,180
Yes, we reported it.

240
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,859
She's with us.

241
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,659
Her name is Hwang Seo Yeon?

242
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,060
It's okay.

243
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:11,420
What's wrong?

244
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,699
She was eating some bread when she got spooked.

245
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,139
She won't come out.

246
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,940
Why are you holding that?

247
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,859
I was preparing for the next magic trick.

248
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,379
I think we should put it away.

249
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
This?

250
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,739
This does this.

251
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,340
Is your name Hwang Seo Yeon?

252
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,180
Yes.

253
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:50,859
Your mom called to say she's looking for you.

254
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,779
I have to go to So Mang.

255
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,580
I have to hug her.

256
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,739
Wouldn't she be with Mom?

257
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:05,100
Mom doesn't know So Mang.

258
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,340
Don't tell Uncle.

259
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:11,819
"Uncle?"

260
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,510
I don't want to go to Mom.

261
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,379
I have to find So Mang soon.

262
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,138
You don't have to go anywhere if you don't want to.

263
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,939
I won't ask you anything else.

264
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,379
You remember what this place is, right?

265
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:30,179
We help keep kids safe

266
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,859
I should check out Seo Yeon's home.

267
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,459
I agree.

268
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,060
It would be best for you to see for yourself.

269
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,939
- Right. I'll take off, then. - Okay.

270
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,699
Youngwon Apartment 118-508, Dongho-ro 8-Gil 22, Jung-Gu

271
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,419
Did you report Seo Yeon missing?

272
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,990
I did because you told me to.

273
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,540
Will it get me in trouble?

274
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:11,510
No, of course not.

275
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,619
Don't worry at all.

276
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:16,459
Our Mr. Kang told us to give you this.

277
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,899
Have it for dinner with your husband.

278
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,300
Okay.

279
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:22,540
We'll be on our way, then.

280
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:35,939
How'd they lose track of a kid? What a nuisance.

281
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,179
Oh, it's open.

282
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
Hello?

283
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:47,990
Go Eun, are you with the kid?

284
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,619
Yes, I'm with Seo Yeon.

285
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,580
Can you send me a photo of her side profile?

286
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,139
Why? What's this about?

287
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:57,990
I want to check something.

288
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,459
Hello, I'd like to ask you something.

289
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:23,269
I'm playing hide and seek and I can't find the kid.

290
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,899
Who's at the door?

291
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:26,699
Hello.

292
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,219
Have you seen this kid nearby?

293
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,699
No, I haven't.

294
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:35,060
I haven't either.

295
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:38,340
Why would you look for your kid here?

296
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Bye.

297
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,020
Seoul

298
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,939
What a headache. What should we do?

299
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,580
Her parents didn't recognize her?

300
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,509
If they didn't meet often,

301
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,540
they wouldn't recognize her side profile.

302
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,699
I think they had someone else report her missing.

303
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:13,780
"Someone else?"

304
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,939
Where's that person now?

305
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:18,510
Right in front of me.

306
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,379
We'll get yelled at, I'm sure.

307
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:32,379
Come on, hurry up.

308
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:33,990
Oh, gosh.

309
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,780
Mr. Im, hurry up!

310
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,658
Who set this out? It's a mess.

311
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,300
- That was me. - Look at all the dust.

312
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:49,989
Wipe it off.

313
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,619
Yes, like that.

314
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,580
Hello.

315
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,619
Take a look.

316
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:58,750
We have something perfect for you.

317
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:05,699
Consultations for newlyweds and the houseless

318
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,659
Buy your own house with the help of Mr. Kang!

319
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,539
House purchase consultation

320
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,139
Trust us to find the right property

321
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:27,139
Hello, welcome. Are you married?

322
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,020
- No. - Then you must pass.

323
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,780
Head to another booth.

324
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,179
Try elsewhere.

325
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,340
- Hello. - Are you house shopping?

326
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,059
Take a look.

327
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,459
- Stop by. - No, thanks.

328
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:45,059
I'm so sorry to bother you for nothing.

329
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,859
It's fine. We get confused too.

330
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,378
Then the Hwang Seo Yeon that was here...

331
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:52,579
No, the girl that was here was called Han Seo Hyun.

332
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,340
The missing girl's called Hwang Seo Yeon.

333
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,899
You're confused too, aren't you?

334
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,698
Han Seo Hyun...

335
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:00,218
was reunited with her mom and went home.

336
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,939
I hope that you locate Hwang Seo Yeon.

337
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
- Sure. - Right.

338
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:22,740
Mom? Dad? Seo Yeon, So Mang, Uncle?

339
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,740
She said the uncles took her.

340
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,020
Was she kidnapped?

341
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:29,899
Let me summarize.

342
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,458
Seo Yeon's looking for So Mang.

343
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:33,819
Where is So Mang, then?

344
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,858
Probably with her parents.

345
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,819
The parents didn't recognize Seo Yeon,

346
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,219
so I doubt they know who So Mang is either.

347
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,499
But they reported her missing.

348
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,698
People who don't know her made the call.

349
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:43,858
How can strangers report a girl missing?

350
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,378
They must know her, then.

351
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:46,939
- As in who? - Seo Yeon's parents.

352
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,060
But the parents didn't recognize Seo Yeon.

353
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,178
How can strangers report a girl missing?

354
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:54,059
Stop being a broken record. You're confusing me.

355
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,340
The summary has me dizzy. I don't get what's happening.

356
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:58,099
I don't get it either.

357
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,739
Who's looking after Seo Yeon at the moment?

358
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,419
Mr. Oh is babysitting.

359
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:04,580
Kim, what are your thoughts on this?

360
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:06,379
If you think about it,

361
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,740
Seo Yeon has only been speaking the truth.

362
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:12,379
We're the ones who didn't understand her.

363
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:16,099
Do you know your parents' phone number...

364
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,179
or your home address?

365
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,580
My mom doesn't know who So Mang is.

366
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,979
Don't you think this is a case for the cops?

367
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,939
If we contact them, they'll call the parents right away.

368
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,219
The parents who didn't even recognize Seo Yeon?

369
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:34,699
No can do.

370
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,658
Why don't we ask Seo Yeon for more details?

371
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:41,819
No. Until she opens up to us on her own accord,

372
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,740
we should refrain from questioning her.

373
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,300
Why?

374
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,099
The younger the children are,

375
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,339
they subconsciously change their answers...

376
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,178
to what would satisfy whoever asked the questions...

377
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,980
by sensing his or her behaviour and tone of voice.

378
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:55,179
Because they're scared.

379
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,779
We'll have to wait until she no longer...

380
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,859
sees us as a threat.

381
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,300
Mr. Oh

382
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,340
Yes, Mr. Oh.

383
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:10,500
What? The kid's gone?

384
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,899
I thought she was asleep and went to get some coffee.

385
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:20,260
I got back and she was gone.

386
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,099
- She isn't anywhere outside. - She's not in the building either.

387
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,459
Could she have left the lot?

388
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,060
No, she never left the building.

389
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,939
Where did you go?

390
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,980

00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,459
You must've heard everything we said.

395
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:03,699
Mister,

396
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:06,060
you trust me, don't you?

397
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:23,699
Please find So Mang.

00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:47,739
It's our first time...

406
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,740
beginning service without doing our homework.

407
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,780
Mr. Kim, where are we headed?

408
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,459
To find So Mang.

409
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:56,739
Do you know where she is?

410
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,300
Her location is a mystery to us.

411
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:01,219
How can we find her, then?

412
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,500
I don't know where she is,

413
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:05,939
but I know who we must talk to.

414
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:07,459
Who?

415
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:15,419
Old Bachelor's Fresh Fruits

416

Mr. Kang's Lecture on How to Buy a Home

418
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:35,340
It's blocking the sign.

419
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,379
Get the door.

420
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
The sun's too bright.

421
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,898
Special consultation for housing subscription

422
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,939
You're here, sir.

423
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,859
Let's move that to the left.

424
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,619
No, to my left.

425
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,099
No, it's this way.

426
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,859
Mr. Kang wanted you to have it.

427
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,059
The Mr. Kang who had the couple report Seo Yeon missing...

428
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,100
is him.

429
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:17,859
Kang Pil Seung

430
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,540
Mr. Kang's name is Kang Pil Seung.

431
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,379
Is that why his company is called Feel Consulting?

432
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,859
How one-dimensional.

433
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,938
What on earth is all this?

434
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,898
Ownership of Real Estate

435
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:37,939
No way.

436
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:41,980
High-end apartment units near subway stations?

437
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,819
He has three in Seoul.

438
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,138
I haven't come across anyone with this many units before.

439
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:47,698
Gosh, he even has a building in his name.

440
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,020
No way. He's super rich.

441
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,340
It was better the other way.

442
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:02,658
Are you looking for a home? Mr. Kang is here for you!

Kang Pil Seung shares his secret to buying your own house.

448
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:23,260
Is this man that famous?

449
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:25,858
The one who Mr. Kang chooses...

450
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,300
ends up with their own home.

451
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,938
But I hear that he only chooses...

452
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:32,619
a small number of people he likes.

453
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:34,579
He must be gifted.

454
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,138
- Exactly. - My gosh.

455
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:38,218
- Mr. Kang. - Please stand back.

456
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:40,179
You're being too harsh again. It's fine.

457
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,139
I came from Jeju Island to hear you speak.

458
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:45,658
Can I get your autograph?

459
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,540
I'm not sure I'm even worthy of you coming all this way.

460
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,138
Thank you so much.

461
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:53,340
It's an honour. Could we possibly shake hands?

462
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,300
Sure.

463
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,659
Thank you!

464
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,458
I hope you learn a lot today.

465
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,340
- Thank you so much. - Don't mention it.

466
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:06,418
You may now enter the auditorium.

467
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:07,580
- Sure. - This way, please.

468
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:10,300
Please maintain order...

469
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:12,780
and enter in two lines.

470
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,780
You can't block people when they're all up in my face.

471
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,060
- It's not like I'm blind. - I'm sorry.

472
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,580
Here.

473
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,060
Deal with them in advance.

474
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:27,540
I'll do better, sir.

475
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:28,740
You're all talk.

Kang Pil Seung shares his secret to buying your own house.

480
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,300
You must have a ticket to enter.

481
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,299
We were invited, but we forgot to bring our ticket.

482
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,339
I'm sorry, but I can't let you in unless I see it.

483
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,339
We came a long way to hear Mr. Kang speak.

484
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,780
Can't you just let us in?

485
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:55,499
Many claim that as well, so I'm sorry.

486
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,780
- But... - We know Mr. Kang though.

487
00:31:58,219 --> 00:31:59,339
Go on in.

488
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,739
Consultation for newlyweds...

489
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,820
and those without homes under their names

490
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:04,699
Go on in.

491
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,580
Can you stop drinking that?

492
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:16,540
One should drink it while it's fresh.

493
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:19,699
I looked into the couple who reported Seo Yeon missing.

494
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:22,579
They recently adopted Seo Yeon.

495
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,659
She was adopted?

496
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,458
Then why didn't the couple recognize her?

497
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:29,020
What does adoption have to do with a real estate consulting business?

498
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:30,500
There isn't a connection.

499
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:31,740
Normally, there wouldn't be.

500
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:33,580
But it's connected in this case.

501
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:39,979
Buy your own house with the help of Feel Consulting.

502
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,020
Wait.

503
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,419
Isn't that Seo Yeon?

504
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,260
It is. It's her.

505
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:49,060
And she might be So Mang.

506
00:32:49,699 --> 00:32:51,059
- What the... - What's going on?

507
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,139
Should we torture them into telling us the truth?

508
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Yes, Mr. Jang.

509
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,060
Just a second.

510
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:02,139
Go ahead.

511
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,619
I only say this out of concern,

512
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:07,820
but we must tread lightly on this case.

513
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,659
Whatever the truth is, there are children at stake.

514
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,219
That's right. There shouldn't be any torture.

515
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,780
We should talk it out since children are at stake.

516
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:20,139
Would talking to them work though?

517
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:22,619
And it's not like anyone can get a consultation with him.

518
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,980
What could be a good way?

519
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:26,859
Buy your own house with the help of Feel Consulting.

520
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,820
Go Eun.

521
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,699
Can you do me a favour?

522
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:34,340
Of course. What is it?

523
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:39,459
Can you...

524
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:41,619
marry me?

525
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,300
What?

526
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,580
What?

527
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,260
I guessed your size, and I did a pretty good job.

528
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,540
Thank you.

529
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,980
I tell you this from experience.

530
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,429
Your clothes must stay clean or others will pick on you.

531
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,060
Seo Yeon has new clothes on.

532
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,019
She came to mind, so I bought one.

533
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,909
A clothing store was going to be my first stop.

534
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,389
Thanks for looking out for her.

535
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:44,428
I'll head out for my service, then.

536
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,259
- Sure. Stay safe. - Got it.

537
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,619
Seo Yeon, you said you were going to hug So Mang once you see her.

538
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,020
Wouldn't she love it even more if you gave her a toy as well?

539
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,909
Now that you have pretty clothes on,

540
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,389
let's pick up a toy your sister might like.

541
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,059
Can I do that?

542
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,500
Of course, you can.

543
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,460
Come on. Let's go.

544
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,429
All right. Shall we?

545
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,869
Let's go.

546
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:48,909
Available only for a limited time

547
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,139
I hope I didn't make you wait.

548
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:23,739
I got ready as fast as I could though.

549
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,219
I like it.

550
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,139
What kind of wife would you like?

551
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,339
Why did they report Seo Yeon missing and not her parents?

552
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,299
What's their connection to Seo Yeon?

553
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,779
And where is So Mang? I'd like a wife...

554
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:41,339
who could lead me to those answers.

555
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:42,980
You're a tough one to please.

556
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,139
Let's give it a shot though.

557
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:47,139
Shall we?

558
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,659
Love, Birds

559
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:58,060
All right. This way.

560
00:36:58,179 --> 00:36:59,940
You won't be disappointed.

561
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,059
- Over here. - Why don't you take a look?

562
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,019
- Come this way. - I see.

563
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,818
- Hear us out. - We hear you.

564
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:08,218
- Are you married? - Of course.

565
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:10,619
Mr. Kang is the only solution!

566
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,060
How can I help you?

567
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,739
Isn't it obvious?

568
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:18,579
We're house hunting.

569
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,819
One for us to live in.

570
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
Mr. Im.

571
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,579
You should not be asking a couple in love...

572
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,059
why they are here.

573
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,739
That's pure nonsense.

574
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,908
- Get them a beverage. - Got it.

575
00:37:29,909 --> 00:37:31,818
Feel Consulting

576
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:33,429
- Please have a seat. - Sure.

577
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:35,259
Just a second.

578
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,429
Here.

579
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:41,659
You're a sweetheart.

580
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,580
- Thanks. - Have a seat.

581
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,218
We want to buy a house,

582
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:53,338
but we don't know anything about the market.

583
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,499
You came to the right place.

584
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,819
We specialize in those who are clueless.

585
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,869
What Mr. Im meant...

586
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,429
is that we can help you through the process...

587
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,869
from start to finish.

588
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,060
I see.

589
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,908
Will he be the one to teach us?

590
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:11,980
Sorry?

591
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:13,499
Mr. Kang is the only solution!

592
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,699
Are you saying you don't know who Mr. Kang is?

593
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:18,779
No way.

594
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:20,179
He's the number one tutor...

595
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,778
in the real estate consulting business.

596
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:23,819
Many follow him on social media.

597
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:28,908
My gosh. Sweetie, he must be famous.

598
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:30,499
We came to the right place.

599
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,659
We did!

600
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,178
So when did you two get married?

601
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,389
- Three years ago. - Last month.

602
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:40,739
- Sorry? - What?

603
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,659
We first got married three years ago,

604
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:48,940
but then again last month.

605
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:50,739
I see.

606
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:52,299
It's a second marriage.

607
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,178
Who cares if one was married before...

608
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:56,868
- or not? - Right.

609
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:59,619
We still qualify as newlyweds, right?

610
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:01,698
Of course, you're newlyweds.

611
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:02,980
It won't be a problem.

612
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:07,428
How are you doing financially?

613
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,779
Above 300,000 dollars or below?

614
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,259
- Above. - Below.

615
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:14,259
Sorry?

616
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:17,739
I received alimony in the divorce.

617
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,579
I see.

618
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,698
Money I may not have, but I have you.

619
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,869
You have me by your side.

620
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,980
Thanks.

621
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:31,540
I like how you both are transparent and honest.

622
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,500
Anyway, how would you like...

623
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:37,980
to attend one of Mr. Kang's lectures?

624
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:42,619
I'm giving you a special offer since you're newlyweds.

625
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,460
What?

626
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,868
A special offer?

627
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:55,389
That's right. A special offer.

628
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:00,618
It's in gold letters.

629
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:02,939
Golden Ticket

630
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,980
No way.

631
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:08,940
Feel Consulting

632
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:16,909
Special lecture on housing subscription

633
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:19,020
Thank you.

634
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,619
Welcome. Here's a survey form.

635
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,338
Write down everything truthfully,

636
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,818
especially the procurement plan for funding at the end.

637
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:30,020
If you don't,

638
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:32,619
a one-on-one consultation won't be available.

639
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:35,060
Let me fill that in for us.

640
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,258
Marital status, Children, Number of family members,

641
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:42,429
Total assets, Housing subscription savings

642
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,739
"Current housing option."

643
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:48,020
Which box should we tick?

644
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,100
Feel Consulting

645
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,940
Special lecture on housing subscription

646
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,500
Mr. Kang's Lecture on How to Buy a Home

647
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:11,869
Greetings.

648
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,139
Thank you.

649
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,659
I'm Kang Pil Seung, the CEO of Feel Consulting.

650
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,139
But in the field, I just go by "Mr. Kang."

651
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,779
I will ask you point-blank.

652
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:28,500
What must you do to buy your own house?

653
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,219
- Save up money. - Clearly.

654
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:31,500
No, this is orange juice.

655
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,940
The best way for an average person to buy their own house...

656
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:41,429
is through housing subscription.

657
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:44,819
So what must you do to be selected as a resident?

658
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,738
We should get an account as soon as possible.

659
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:49,059
That's right. Open an account ASAP,

660
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,388
be without a home for a long time,

661
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:51,818
be married for as short as possible,

662
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:53,869
and have many children. Am I right?

663
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:55,218
- Yes. - Yes.

664
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:56,259
All right.

665
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:59,779
Here are apartment units we all wish to have.

666
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:14,179
Let's say that you collected enough points,

667
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:15,659
and luck propelled you...

668
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,739
into being chosen as a resident in one of those apartment units.

669
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:23,619
Would you be happy or not?

670
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:24,738
Happy!

671
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:25,909
You silly man.

672
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:28,299
Thank you.

673
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,539
But would it truly be a dream come true?

674
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,939
Market Transaction Price for Apartments Along Han River

675
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,940
Here.

676
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:42,339
Here is the price for newly built apartments in this area.

677
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,218
Art Rieverium: 4.782 million to 4.833 million dollars

678
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:46,499
Kang Maeul: 3.22 million dollars to 3.3 million dollars

679
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,868
How many digits are there? One, two,

680
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,428
three, four, five,

681
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:50,909
- six. A million dollars? - Six?

682
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:52,460
Who here...

683
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:55,908
can come up with that much money right now?

684
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,339
Raise your hand if you can.

685
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Me. I can take out a loan.

686
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,618
A loan? Unfortunately,

687
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,940
because the price is over 900,000 dollars,

688
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,659
you are not allowed to take out a loan.

689
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:08,940
In other words,

690
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,869
to become a resident in one of those apartments,

691
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,939
you must have over...

692
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,869
a million dollars in cash.

693
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:18,429
That's the truth.

694
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,500
How is that possible...

695
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,060
for average people like yourselves?

696
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:26,580
Who will see that as a possibility, then?

697
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:30,389
Who exactly gets to live in those apartments?

698
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:31,819
That'll be...

699
00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:35,618
the children of rich parents...

700
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:37,459
who can be provided with millions of dollars in cash.

701
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,658
Those born with silver spoons in their mouths...

702
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,299
can buy those apartment units.

703
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:43,980
Children of rich parents who don't own a house?

704
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,939
They spent years not having one under their names...

705
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,338
which means they are eligible to participate...

706
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:48,699
in the housing subscription program.

707
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,778
The down payment, intermediate payment, and the rest.

708
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:52,060
Their parents will take care of the money.

709
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:53,900
But who will benefit from the house price going up?

710
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:56,779
The children born to rich parents.

711
00:43:57,779 --> 00:43:58,900
Can you sense it?

712
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,420
The possibility of people here...

713
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,540
being able to buy an apartment unit on the list...

714
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:05,419
is less than the possibility...

715
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,380
of a camel going through the eye of a needle.

716
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,779
In other words, since you weren't born into money,

717
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,100
you don't stand a chance.

718
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:21,259
This is my conclusion...

719
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,980
and the reality you must face.

720
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,060
No wonder why I couldn't buy my own house.

721
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,060
However, is there really no other way?

722
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:33,979
A long time ago,

723
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,540
I thought about this whenever I drove by the river.

724
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:38,778
"There are so many houses here."

725
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:41,540
"How come I don't have one? Why is it that I can't own a house?"

726
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,219
"I desperately want a house."

727
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,219
"Is there really no other way?"

728
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,379
I kept thinking and didn't stop.

729
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,540
Finally,

730
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,299
I found a way.

731
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:57,259
- What? - He found a way.

732
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,698
Are you curious about what I found out?

733
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,818
- Yes. - Yes.

734
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:04,178
Do you truly want to know?

735
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:05,940
- Yes. - Yes.

736
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,179
The possibility of a camel going through the eye of a needle

737
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,500
I'll tell you on your private consultations.

738
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:16,580
- Come on. - Gosh. That was crazy.

739
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,219
Private Consultation

740
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,339
- Let's give it up for him! - Nicely done.

741
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,259
Hey, where are you going?

742
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,698
To get my consultation.

743
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:32,259
Have you gone mad? You're not going anywhere. Close the door now.

744
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:34,259
I want a house like that.

745
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,980
I want it.

746
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:39,059
- Did you fill that out? - Yes.

747
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,100
Thank you.

748
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:44,019
Those of you who submitted the survey forms,

749
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,580
please wait. We will call your names.

750
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:48,178
It was a simple speech.

751
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,619
But I want to cancel my housing bank account.

752
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:52,540
He seriously looks capable of helping me buy a house.

753
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,060
The toy shop is at the end of this path.

754
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,500
But there is an amusement ride I want to try on our way there.

755
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:10,819
Can we go on that ride first?

756
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,619
Okay. Let's go.

757
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,619
Did you have fun?

758
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,779
Should we go over there and go on one more ride?

759
00:46:46,819 --> 00:46:48,460
Let's go.

760
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,019
Meeting Room 1

761
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,060
Come in.

762
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,219
Hello.

763
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:05,540
- Hello. - Hi.

764
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,539
Honey, sit here.

765
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,900
Goodness. Come on, sweetie.

770
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:32,860
You are so handsome in person.

771
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:35,979
You look great in the photo too.

772
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,138
Right. The kids look so cute.

773
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:39,059
- Right, honey? - Yes. They are so cute.

774
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,900
Are they your nieces? Or daughters?

775
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,299
Please refrain from asking personal questions.

776
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:46,900
- Don't be so harsh. - Okay.

777
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,020
Why do you ask?

778
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,540
Do you want a daughter like that?

779
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,420
Gosh. It's not something we can control.

780
00:47:58,619 --> 00:47:59,659
You can.

781
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,420
Are they matching outfits?

782
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:06,779
- Yes. - Yes. We bought them together.

783
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,900
They look good on you.

784
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,699
Your wife is a bookkeeper at a taxi agency.

785
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:13,819
And you are a taxi driver.

786
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,259
Not just any taxi. He drives a deluxe taxi.

787
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:18,699
I see.

788
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,059
The total amount of assets: Approximately 300,000 dollars

789
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,619
You had the housing subscription for a long time.

790
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:26,699
You haven't been married for long. But you have 300,000 dollars?

791
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:29,939
I guess being a bookkeeper pays well.

792
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,779
Or do you make a lot of money?

793
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,218
Anyway, if you were to get picked,

794
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:35,580
you won't have to worry about the down payment.

795
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,540
Yes.

796
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,860
I worked part-time jobs. To buy a house.

797
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:42,659
What kind of part-time jobs?

798
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,339
For my most recent part-time job, I performed on stage as a singer.

799
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,658
You're such a great singer.

800
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:53,860
Don't say that. Come on, sweetie.

801
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,420
You must feel reassured to have such a diligent wife.

802
00:48:58,339 --> 00:48:59,859
You don't need my help.

803
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,500
You'll be able to buy a house on your own.

804
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,980
Okay.

805
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,299
Thank you for coming in. You can leave now.

00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,219
Feel Consulting

807
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,859
Together, with Mr. Kang!

808
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,580
It didn't work out, right?

809
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,100
Right.

810
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,299
I must have filled out the form wrong.

811
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,980
It's okay.

812
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,020
Forms can be there at one moment and disappear at another.

813
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,619
CEO Kang Pil Seung

814
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:50,819
Information

815
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:53,179
What?

816
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:54,980
Come on.

817
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,540
Mr. Kang is the only solution!

Mr. Kang's Lecture on How to Buy a Home

820
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:03,739
Come on.

821
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,219
It's time to go in.

822
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,818
Darn it. The lights are out in this building too.

823
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,218
- Right. The lights are out. - Why does this keep happening?

824
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:11,219
This is upsetting.

825
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,980
- I wish it didn't happen. - Right?

826
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,139
Who are you?

827
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:17,979
Mr. Kim already went inside. What are you guys doing?

828
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,020
Already?

829
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:21,379
Nothing. We'll fix it right away.

830
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,139
- Please wait. - Please wait.

831
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,659
Buy your own house with the help of Mr. Kang!

835
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:54,380
Can you check if there's any file on Seo Yeon and So Mang?

836
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,060
I'll look for the survey forms.

837
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,939
These files aren't what we're looking for.

838
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,900
These are all related to real estate.

Survey Form for Housing Purchase with Feel Consulting

840
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,579
The total amount of assets: Under 100,000 dollars

841
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,339
These were the answers he was looking for.

842
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,338
What was he looking for?

843
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:31,459
The duration of the subscription: since May 2022

844
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,059
He was looking for couples with not a lot of money...

845
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,020
or couples that didn't qualify to apply for these apartments.

846
00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:39,779
Are these survey forms on their server?

847
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:42,619
No. They must not have uploaded the forms yet.

849
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,379
Do you know why you shouldn't put off...

850
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,219
until tomorrow what can be done today?

851
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,900
Why not?

852
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:00,779
Because you have to start over.

00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:34,738
- What? - You're here.

857
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:36,100
What's going on?

858
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,259
What happened?

859
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,540
What?

860
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:42,380
Survey Form for Housing Purchase with Feel Consulting

861
00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:43,980
They're all wet.

862
00:52:49,259 --> 00:52:50,460
You're here, sir.

863
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,339
What happened to the forms we collected?

864
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,698
Well, they are all wet.

865
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:57,900
Did you save them on the server?

866
00:52:58,139 --> 00:52:59,179
Not yet.

867
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,899
- Get a grip. - Yes, sir.

868
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,499
Why are you making me do the same thing twice?

869
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,338
I was going to save the forms...

870
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:13,540
He needs another lesson.

871
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:18,619
Start over.

872
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,819
Yes, sir. I'll do that, sir!

873
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:28,819
But I can't figure out their real game.

874
00:53:29,659 --> 00:53:32,539
- Their real game? - If we successfully buy a house,

875
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,059
what will they get in return?

876
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,940
I doubt they're going through all this trouble for the commission.

877
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:41,900
But there's another problem with Seo Yeon.

878
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:43,860
Another problem?

879
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,699
They're playing on the playground on a rainy day.

880
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,540
For some reason, I feel like they're still together.

881
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,299
The rain looks odd.

882
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,179
That's not rain.

883
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,219
Those are security bars.

884
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,500
Bars?

885
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,420
They're not playing on the playground.

886
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:07,900
She's watching the kids play,

887
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,060
locked up somewhere.

888
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,020
My mom

889
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,940
Please.

890
00:54:37,219 --> 00:54:41,259
It's so nice to see you again, Mr. Kang.

891
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,460
Your assets suddenly decreased significantly.

892
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:50,060
My husband lost a lot of money from cryptocurrency.

893
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,219
Darn Dodgecoin.

894
00:54:57,819 --> 00:55:00,060
Seeing your papers, I get the feeling...

895
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:02,380
that it will be hard for you two to buy a home.

896
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,460
Does that mean you're not going to help us?

897
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:08,060
I can't help everyone.

898
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,698
I only help those...

899
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:13,460
who fit perfectly with my principles.

900
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:15,500
I hate wasting time.

901
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:18,899
Your principles...

902
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,939
Desperation.

903
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,819
People who are truly desperate.

904
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,499
We are desperate.

905
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,659
I don't think so.

906
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:32,179
How desperate are you about buying a house?

907
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,979
Super desperate.

908
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,619
We are very desperate.

909
00:55:37,259 --> 00:55:39,619
All right. Let me say this again.

910
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,059
I don't want to waste my time on people who are not...

911
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,779
desperate enough.

912
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,179
So you can't lie to me.

913
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,859
You're right. Lying is awful!

914
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,860
- We don't lie. - No way. No lying.

915
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,100
- Ma'am. - Yes.

916
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:02,900
Can you do everything I ask of you?

917
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,420
Are you ready to do anything as long as you can own a house?

918
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:08,739
- Yes. - Yes.

919
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,460
Anything without hesitation?

920
00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:29,339
Please find So Mang.

921
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:34,940
I can do anything as long as I can own a house.

922
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:37,060
I will give you my heart if you ask me.

923
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,219
I desperately need your help.

924
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,100
Yes.

925
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:49,579
M5283

926
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,338
He's too young to be that skeptical.

927
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:53,259
Didn't he look like he was paranoid?

928
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:55,539
It felt like he was testing us.

929
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,779
Deluxe

930
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,339
Mr. Kang

931
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,339
Yes, Mr. Kang. Hello.

932
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,900
Pardon?

933
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:11,699
No. It's an honour.

934
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,699
Okay. Then I'll see you soon.

935
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:17,339
I'm hanging up now. Peace.

936
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:19,179
"Peace?"

937
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:22,020
It was probably a test.

938
00:57:22,819 --> 00:57:25,099
- Why? - What's the address...

939
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,259
we wrote down for our house?

940
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:29,380
We used Mr. Jang's home address. Why do you ask?

941
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,219
He's on his way...

942
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:33,460
to our house.

943
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,580
What? Now?

944
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:39,179
What do we do? We didn't prepare anything for this.

945
00:57:41,739 --> 00:57:43,819
Do you know how to decorate a house for newlyweds?

946
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:47,060
We don't have much time. Let's start collecting.

947
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,219
- Again? - Hurry up.

948
00:57:49,339 --> 00:57:51,219
No. I have to hurry up. Here we go. I'll step on it.

949
00:57:52,299 --> 00:57:54,339
Old Bachelor's Fresh Fruits

950
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,940
Mr. Kang!

951
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,258
We should have gotten here first and wait for you.

952
00:58:21,259 --> 00:58:22,379
Thank you for coming...

953
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,739
- to our humble house. - Thank you.

954
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,940
By the way, your house seems better than I expected.

955
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:29,139
Gosh, no way.

956
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,420
The whole house isn't for us.

957
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,020
We're only renting out one room in this big house.

958
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,179
I see.

959
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,020
- Please come in. - Yes, come in.

960
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,259
What?

961
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,619
I think it is her.

962
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,060
How can I help you?

963
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:03,139
Oh, hello.

964
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,420
Didn't a kid come in here? She's about this tall.

965
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,500
Hold on. The youngest person here is...

966
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,860
Hey, Youngest!

967
01:00:12,259 --> 01:00:14,179
Yes, I'm the youngest.

968
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:16,339
Did you want to see me?

969
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,139
I'm the second youngest.

970
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,139
Are you looking for me?

971
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:24,619
No. I must have been mistaken.

972
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,580
Have a good day then.

973
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,980
Seo Yeon.

974
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,779
Weren't you scared?

975
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:46,540
I wasn't scared.

976
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,179
I'll be safe here.

977
01:00:53,299 --> 01:00:54,900
That's right.

978
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,699
Gosh, what a good girl you are. Let's go.

979
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,258
Right. What about the house? Did you decorate the place?

980
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:04,339
Gosh. We did an amazing job.

981
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:08,659
I haven't heard from them, but I bet they're loving it.

982
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,020
Just the thought of that room makes me happy.

983
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:27,139
Come on in.

984
01:01:28,179 --> 01:01:29,940
- Excuse me. - Sure.

985
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,980
Gosh. The interior design here...

986
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,900
is unique.

987
01:01:46,139 --> 01:01:47,179
We are...

988
01:01:48,219 --> 01:01:49,500
quite affectionate.

989
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,139
Very.

990
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,580
Come on in.

991
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:10,940
Goodness. This place is making me dizzy.

992
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,020
Ta-Da!

993
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:17,860
I prepared a surprise event for you, honey.

994
01:02:19,259 --> 01:02:22,460
When did you prepare all this? Gosh, you're unstoppable.

995
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,380
- This way. - Okay.

996
01:02:49,339 --> 01:02:50,860
So this is the room you're renting?

997
01:02:51,259 --> 01:02:53,540
Yes. That's right.

998
01:02:55,659 --> 01:02:56,699
Let me take a look around.

999
01:03:04,259 --> 01:03:06,819
That's a single bed.

1000
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:12,139
For newlyweds, the smaller the bed is, the better.

1001
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,779
I see. There's only one pillow.

1002
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:20,219
His arm is my pillow.

1003
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:24,139
I use his arm.

1004
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:28,500
- Why don't you have some coffee? - Okay.

1005
01:03:38,179 --> 01:03:39,299
Hold on.

1006
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:56,020
You guys aren't married, are you?

1007
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:52,460
Taxi Driver 2

1008
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:55,860
Where on earth are these kids from?

1009
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,060
Get up!

1010
01:04:57,699 --> 01:04:59,900
- Are you ready to be a dad? - Pardon?

1011
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,779
A baby will be born here.

1012
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,659
This is how they've been taking the kids.

1013
01:05:08,139 --> 01:05:09,460
You guys need a beating.

1014
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,420
Where are the kids?

1015
01:05:12,739 --> 01:05:13,739
Where are they?

1016
01:05:14,779 --> 01:05:16,619
- The kids are gone. - Where are the kids?

1017
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,540
Be quiet. I told you to be quiet.

1018
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:22,699
You won't be able to take a step...

1019
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,900
outside here.

1020
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,060
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

1021
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,980
Don't come here. Follow Kang Pil Seung.

1022
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,259
The kids come first.

1023
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:36,420
As adults,

1024
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:38,940
we're very sorry.
