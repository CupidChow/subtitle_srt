1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,860
The final exam papers
[Episode 9]

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,820
were leaked at the Police University.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,000
The cradle of justice, the National Police University.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,600
KCS News focused on the corruption that took place at the school,

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,980
which mars that ideal.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,100
It has been less than a year since Professor Yu began at the Police University.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,410
He gave out the answers for his own class exam.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,010
According to the Asan police station, Mr. Yu initially denied all charges,

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,780
but eventually confessed during the investigation.

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,720
What are you saying suddenly?

11
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,240
I leaked the final exam.

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,440
You bastard, what are you doing?

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,200
You should have been the one to handcuff me.

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,260
Hey! Park Cheol Jin!

15
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,910
I wanted to make some money and ... here I am.

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,050
Hey, you punk!

17
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,360
You should have quit when you found the listening device!

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,220
Even though I acted like I lost my memory,

19
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,910
you wouldn't put on the brakes.

20
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,430
You bastard! Shut your mouth.

21
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,160
Senior Inspector Yu Dong Man. Mentor.

22
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,250
You can stop watching my back now.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,500
You crazy bastard.

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,180
Wait, what's going on right now?

25
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,930
Professor Yu Dong Man was crying.

26
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,690
How could Professor Yu Dong Man cry?

27
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,930
Isn't he also a human?

28
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,300
If your heart hurts and you're upset, you could cry.

29
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,040
Yeah, Kang Hui. It's almost time to go back.

30
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,190
Don't wait and go ahead.

31
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,740
I'll take Professor Yu— Oh.

32
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,200
Prof—

33
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,810
You did it on purpose, didn't you, so that I could write the article.

34
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,780
I'm Lim Byun Seok, reporter for KCS.

35
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,330
You're Professor Yu Dong Man, right?

36
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,050
A student from the Police University sent me a tip

37
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:14,460
that the answer key for a test was leaked, but the school was covering it up.

38
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,120
- Go away.
- Is it an illegal solicitation or something like that?

39
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,930
You trash reporter, can't you hear me?

40
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,740
- I said get lost.
- Come on, would you feel good if I called you jjapsae (like calling a police officer "pig")?

41
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,250
We're just checking facts from a position of providing the citizens with the truth.

42
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,590
The truth? Yeah right.

43
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,940
Do you guys even care about that?

44
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,530
A scolding from the cop who committed an act of corruption.

45
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,370
I can see the headline.

46
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,450
Corrupt police officer revealed. The current state of police officer training and corruption.

47
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,270
I will broadcast it very provocatively for you.

48
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,190
You know well that our country gets angry easily over an issue like this.

49
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,540
- Is that it?
- What?

50
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,300
A jjapsae that was like a gangster, casually committed false statements,

51
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,910
concealment, corruption, and abuse of power.

52
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,140
Is he the only one responsible for this corruption? What was covered up?

53
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,120
How much of what he said was false?

54
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,030
If you're going to start something,

55
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,160
make sure you do it thoroughly and get it right

56
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,410
if you're not a trash reporter

57
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,660
but a real reporter, punk.

58
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,910
Have you gone crazy because you want to be buried by the public?

59
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,450
Even if I did and in the end, if he doesn't come,

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,940
I should be buried too.

61
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,790
Hey, Reporter Im!

62
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,950
- Hurry up and leave.
- Ay—
- Stop!

63
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,930
We're not done with our investigation.

64
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,610
There's a ban on news reports. Leave.

65
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,400
- I'll just have some coffee before I go.
- What coffee? Just go!

66
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,890
We only have two.

67
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,600
So go home.

68
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,410
The report.

69
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,620
Let's write it.

70
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,110
Are you sure?

71
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,920
Admitting to the crime, right then when I was present.

72
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,850
After hearing that, would I write an article or not?

73
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,920
Of course, I would write it.

74
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,240
- What is it that you want to say?
- You knew, didn't you,

75
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,050
that if the news went out, Park Cheol Jin, the real criminal, would come forward.

76
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,330
I did hear that you two were partners.

77
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,330
Is that why?

78
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,650
Write an article, not a script, you punk.

79
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
You definitely said that!

80
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,170
"If that guy doesn't come, then I will be buried instead."

81
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,290
I should suffer. A police officer

82
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,580
couldn't catch his subordinate, who was standing right next to him making a mess.

83
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,540
That's why I waited for him to come and confess by himself.

84
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,580
And he did! So that's it.

85
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,910
So, you punk, keep your eye on this case.

86
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,380
Keep track of who is in charge of the investigation, how everything is going,

87
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,040
and what the hidden truth behind this case is.

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,810
Keep your eyes open and use your pen well.

89
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,970
If you're a real reporter,

90
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,780
and not a trash reporter, then I'll be a detective and not a jjapsae.

91
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,040
- But why do you keep speaking informally?
- You can do it too, you punk!

92
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,020
Yeah, Reporter Oh, it's me. Who's in charge of the investigation on the Police University answer key case?

93
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,470
Professor!

94
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,800
Let's go to school now.

95
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,130
Yes, Professor.

96
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,210
- Goodbye.
- Good work.

97
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,920
Deposit complete.

98
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,800
Park Cheol Jin's address. #301 Gyeongam Officetel,

99
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,780
21 Haengyeong-ro, Yangjin-myeon, Asan-si, is this correct?

100
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,180
Uhm, beyond the answer key...

101
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,050
I wanted to make a statement about the illegal gambling case as well.

102
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,910
I'd be thankful if you could reach out to the Seoul Metropolitan Team—

103
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,650
Your mother, Kim Yeong Su. Your younger sister, Park Na Hyeon.

104
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,290
It's correct?

105
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,340
- What the hell are you do—
- Shut your mouth.

106
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,150
It's an order from the higher ups.

107
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,280
You have to protect your family first.

108
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,640
Park Cheol Jin's address / Apartment 301 Kyungyam Officetel, Hengyoung-ro 21,Yangjinmyeon, Asan City

109
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,240
One. Two. Three.

110
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,630
Then, the exams are restarting from today, right?

111
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,220
Honestly, I was hoping the Investigation exam would be canceled.

112
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,720
I didn't study this weekend.

113
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,770
- You never study.
- You're right.

114
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,600
But do you think Professor Yu Dong Man is all right?

115
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,580
No sleep in days,

116
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,690
and not eating properly at all.

117
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm all right.

118
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,010
And a face like dry firewood!

119
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,640
I'm so upset.

120
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,270
Will Professor Yu be all right?

121
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,700
The administration office is a mess too. Professor Yu is probably worse.

122
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,150
Here. There was an unsavory incident a little while ago,

123
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,510
but the final exams should be completed as scheduled, right?

124
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,010
Professor Yu, is the Investigation exam today?

125
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,920
Yes. I'm planning on giving the exam today.

126
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,480
Also, the professors who finished their exams can finish grading them by this week.

127
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,340
It seems like some reporters are still holding out,

128
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,220
so please refrain from contacting the media as much as possible.

129
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,850
All right, then let's wrap up today's meeting.

130
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,970
I have been waiting for you to apologize,

131
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,160
but you're leaving today as well.

132
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,610
What? Did I say something wrong?

133
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,020
I mean, look at what happened to our school's status because we brought in the wrong person.

134
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,970
Oh, was it two people?

135
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,800
You're right. We don't even have the basics and came in causing trouble.

136
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,140
I apologize.

137
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,670
He looks fine after all.

138
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,020
Look at him, what did you do so well?

139
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,570
I don't think Professor Yu did anything wrong.

140
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,980
You don't know, do you? I heard the two of them were partners.

141
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,270
All right, all right. Why are the professors even acting like this?

142
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,130
To be honest, the professors need to take an exam before getting hired.

143
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,380
I didn't study this hard so that

144
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,910
I could learn from someone like Yu Dong Man.

145
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,440
- Doesn't that piss you off?
- Of course it pisses me off.

146
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,200
But who the hell reported it to the news?

147
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,370
Exactly, who was it?

148
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,610
Hey, does that matter?

149
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,190
What matters is that a human being like that gangster is still a professor.

150
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,520
I can't even write a petition for this.

151
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,460
I know.

152
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,610
Today is the final exam, and at the same time,

153
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,550
it's the last day of the first semester of Investigation.

154
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,790
I ...

155
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,030
Aren't you going to hand out the exam papers?

156
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:46,820
What, are you telling me, the professor who cheated, to shut up and hand over the exam papers?

157
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,900
Even if it sucks and you don't want to hear it, be patient.

158
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,740
If you don't like that, it's all right, you can leave the classroom right now.

159
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,390
Because I'll be petty and give you an F.

160
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,330
I'm sorry for the delay in the exam.

161
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,480
I'm also sorry for the reporters that are lined up in front of the school.

162
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,110
I'm sorry that I canceled class on you so many times during the semester.

163
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,710
I was thinking about saying something like that but forget it.

164
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,120
I'll just say one thing.

165
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,240
Don't hate your Investigation class because you hate your professor

166
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,310
because it'll be your loss. Got it?

167
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,130
The exam time is 70 minutes. Let's start.

168
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,260
11:02 am

169
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,280
First semester final exam for the 2021 first years.
Investigation exam questions

170
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,230
11:30 am

171
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,350
40. What is the most important thing in an investigation?

172
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,050
Perseverance

173
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,990
Passion

174
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,590
Fact

175
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,300
Evidence

176
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,360
Evidence

177
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,460
40. What is the most important thing in an investigation?

178
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,380
Did you solve the questions?

179
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,820
But what he said earlier, he meant don't hate the person even if you hate the crime, right?

180
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,940
He meant you can hate the person,

181
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,580
but don't hate Investigations class.

182
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,990
Hey, Professor Yu.

183
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,630
I'm going to go first.

184
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:13,760
I guess that Professor Yu's confession was really false.

185
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,970
Of course, it was false.

186
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,900
Who reported it to the news?

187
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,420
I'm sure it was one of the students.

188
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,820
I think why they did it is more important.

189
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,220
I'll head out first.

190
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,560
I'll head out first.

191
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,030
National Police University

192
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,020
It was you.

193
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,740
That's right. I reported it.

194
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,720
- Why?
- I think it's wrong.

195
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,820
An insider commits a crime in the presence of police and reserve officers,

196
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,070
and the elders are trying to keep it quiet.

197
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,660
Someone was not righteous, and the school wasn't fair.

198
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,660
I didn't learn to turn a blind eye to those things.

199
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,600
Is that so?

200
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,660
But what does it have to do with fairness or justice,

201
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,750
if the investigation of the case wasn't even finished?

202
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,720
If it was for me, don't do this again.

203
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,490
Why?

204
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,500
Because whatever I do, you won't change your mind?

205
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,100
No, because you're a good person.

206
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,390
As you said, you made the choice because it was fair and just,

207
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,140
so don't ever make a foolish choice again because of me.

208
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,560
And you're right. It won't change my mind.

209
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,500
If nothing I do will change your mind, then I'll just do what I want.

210
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,740
I can't give up even if you die.

211
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,800
From now, because of you, I think I'll keep making that foolish choice.

212
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,580
- Hey, Park Min Gyu.
- I'm not going to hide it anymore either.

213
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,790
Cheol Jin, that punk, said he won't meet anyone,

214
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,060
so don't waste your time either.

215
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,000
Who does he think he is?

216
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,650
Is the investigation still ongoing?

217
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,530
Hey, it's a case caused by a guy from our station, so they aren't even sharing it with us.

218
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,780
They aren't even showing us a single statement.

219
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,300
All right, I'm hanging up.

220
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,630
Professor, play a judo match with me.

221
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,750
Ah!

222
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,330
What the hell did you learn?

223
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,560
Talk to me, punk. Talk to me. Talk to me.

224
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,860
You're the one who should talk.

225
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,990
What happened? What's going to happen?

226
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,430
Are you not going to say anything?

227
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,290
I'm also by your side.

228
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,380
- Are you comforting me?
- I'm telling you because I don't think you know.

229
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,930
- What are you going to do now?
- Why do you keep asking?!

230
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,260
We have to catch the criminal because it doesn't end with Ahjussi Cheol Jin.

231
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,060
The burner phone that was used to contact Ahjussi Cheol Jin.

232
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,630
Why are you doing this?

233
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:09,180
I mean, why the hell did this investigation become so important to you?

234
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,070
If I hadn't hacked you back then,

235
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,330
you'd have caught all those illegal gamblers.

236
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:23,370
Then Kang Hui's mom wouldn't have been on trial for something she didn't do.

237
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,820
Whether you hacked it or not,

238
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,340
it is my fault as a police officer for letting go of the culprit.

239
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,370
It's Oh Kang Hui's mother's fault that she was deceived while trying to relieve her gambling debt

240
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,020
by selling her account.

241
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,270
You knew?

242
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,210
- Kang Hui's mom's trial?
- Would I have kept saying I would catch the culprit

243
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,790
without even knowing that?

244
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,790
The trial isn't over yet.

245
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,630
We just have to find the crucial evidence before that.

246
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,740
This punk thinks I'm some kind of idiot.

247
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Then from when do we start investigating again?

248
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,340
Professor.

249
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,480
Yu Dong Man
Police University

250
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,860
Kang Seon Ho

251
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,200
Police use this technique the most on site.

252
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,220
Learn this properly first and come.

253
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,400
You can't even flip me over. Who do you think you can catch?

254
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,050
Yu Dong Man
Police University

255
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,230
We have to catch the criminal because it doesn't end with Ahjussi Cheol Jin.

256
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,880
Put it down there.

257
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,660
Evidence No. 4

258
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,710
Evidence No. 7

259
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,680
We conducted a search warrant on your apartment,

260
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,660
All the burner phones and the fake bank accounts that you confessed to using for the crime

261
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,690
were confiscated as evidence.

262
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,470
Your accomplice, the taxi driver, also confessed that he did everything

263
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,380
as per your orders. You, Park Cheol Jin, will

264
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,940
be transferred to the detention center soon.

265
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,760
From now on, you'll continue ...

266
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,900
to not talk

267
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,420
or hear anything.

268
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,110
You know, right?

269
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,000
All the evidence of Cheol Jin's illegal gambling operation came out

270
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,430
and he will be transferred to the detention center soon.

271
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,720
If you kill someone,

272
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,410
how many years is the prison sentence?

273
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,540
It depends,

274
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,340
but I also don't know when it's accidental murder

275
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,330
out of jealously. Hey! Why is he touching her there?!

276
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,600
Hey! Would a gun be better or a knife?

277
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,590
I think

278
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,130
a gun would be better.

279
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,290
Shoot!

280
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,150
If you're an accomplice, we'll share the jail time, right?

281
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,090
Yesterday enemies and today accomplices?

282
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,510
Let's make it a win-win situation to defeat a bigger enemy.

283
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,040
She— She smiled!

284
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,240
Sunbae, don't smile for him.

285
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,410
Why is she smiling for him?!

286
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,190
Sunbae Myeong Jung is screwed now.

287
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,980
He became a public enemy number one

288
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,120
since Beom Tae and Jun Wuk are working together now.

289
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,860
- What about the work between you and the professor?
- What?

290
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,190
Didn't you call me out to tell me about that?

291
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,730
Right.

292
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,760
Shall we sit down for a while?

293
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,800
Park Cheol Jin won't be transferred today.

294
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,500
You can't meet him anyway, so just leave.

295
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,270
Then...

296
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,230
convey my words.

297
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,130
- Kang Hui—
- So

298
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,780
when did you find out that the case you are investigating with the professor is my mom's case?

299
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,430
Just recently.

300
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,480
I found out when we went to your mom's trial.

301
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,030
Seems like Professor already knew.

302
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,140
He said that since the trial isn't over yet,

303
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,650
we can just catch the culprit before then.

304
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,950
Professor was already doing the investigation so well.

305
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,600
But what about you?

306
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,640
Why are you doing this investigation with him?

307
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,920
I...

308
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,910
messed up once.

309
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,520
That is why Professor couldn't catch them.

310
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,000
At first, it was because of that.

311
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,010
But now I learned while doing this investigation that

312
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,500
I shouldn't give up even if I'm afraid

313
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,180
and that I shouldn't run away even if it's scary.

314
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,750
Even if the person close to me is the criminal,

315
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,620
I have to relentlessly identify the crime.

316
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,580
That's how you protect the person you care about

317
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,730
as a police officer.

318
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,910
I also want to become such a police officer.

319
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,240
I really want to become like that.

320
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,290
That is why I decided to

321
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,000
do this investigation till the end.

322
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,300
And that police officer is

323
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,730
Professor Yu Dong Man?

324
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,210
Yes, Lawyer.

325
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,620
I want to meet my mom.

326
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,000
It's been a long time since the brakes broke,

327
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,550
so take care of yourself, you criminal loser.

328
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,810
That's from your crazy mentor.

329
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,630
But what the hell does that mean?

330
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,980
It means he's going to see this through to the end.

331
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,340
The starting was with the illegal gambling site.

332
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,450
And then Kang Seon Ho hacked their accounts.

333
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,520
The site and the accounts are all gone.

334
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,290
Now we have no chance to get these guys.

335
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,170
- Everything we worked on for a whole year is gone!
- What is this?

336
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,190
You're suspended, jerk! Get out!

337
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,990
Then Cheol Jin was attacked while he was giving me information.

338
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,420
The ones that you are after from the gambling site,

339
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,750
they're at the National Police University—

340
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,310
There were two suspects when

341
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,460
Cheol Jin got hurt.

342
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,230
Go Deok Bae, Professor Gwon.

343
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,020
The alibi of professor Gwon was proven.

344
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,990
Park Cheol Jin getting caught at that time.

345
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,510
It means the unregistered phone called him, and Cheol Jin came here.

346
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,500
His phone and movements

347
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,900
are the same base station.

348
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,450
The same pattern keeps recurring.

349
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,150
A burner phone that gave instructions to Park Cheol Jin

350
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,920
and...

351
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,110
the wiretapping device in my office.

352
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,230
Within three kilometers.

353
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,610
There is one person who I couldn't confirm till now.

354
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,180
Go Deok Bae
Gwon Hyeok Pil

355
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,740
Go Deok Bae

356
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,050
Go Deok Bae.

357
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,220
Go Deok Bae

358
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,410
National Police University
We will be open when the semester starts. Gossi Beer is on vacation.

359
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,810
Damn it, why now?

360
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,500
Customer Go Deok Bae
This month's meter rate - 1,517,530 ₩

361
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,950
What?

362
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,950
Why is the electricity bill so expensive?

363
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,380
Driver's license preparation guide

364
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,430
National Police Unversity students are commissioned as inspectors immediately after graduation and put to work right away.

365
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:49,320
With that said, a driver's license is essential because you have to start driving right away.

366
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,810
- Understood?
- Yes!

367
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,120
Once I get my driver's license, vacation really starts, right?

368
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,180
Getting a driver's license, why did Sunbae Myeong Jung have to put this up?

369
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,580
I'm swamped to death.

370
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,030
What are you doing? Are you looking for me once again?

371
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,620
- Did you have a hard time sleeping?
- No.

372
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,020
Wait a moment, I'll go to the store and get you some necessities.

373
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,670
I'm said I'm fine. I slept well.

374
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,860
I'll go in first.

375
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,130
Contents of registration certificate for buildings

376
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,190
Owner : Go Deok Bae

377
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,040
Building Details
Cement block structure, cement tile roof, slab roof two-story building, B1, ground floor, and 2nd floor.

378
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,430
The first basement level?

379
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,220
Where on earth is this first basement?

380
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,940
It doesn't even seem to have any stairs or doors.

381
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,960
What are you doing?

382
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,360
You didn't see my text?

383
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,240
Gossi Beer is closed on vacation so today's work dinner party is at the jokbal (pig's feet/trotters) restaurant.

384
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,830
First, let's raise our glasses.

385
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:51,240
Well, there was an unpleasant incident,

386
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,670
but thanks to the professors,

387
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,710
who have ended the semester well.

388
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,750
Drink as much as you want.

389
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,020
I hope you have a relaxing time.

390
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,650
You worked hard!

391
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,880
You worked hard too!

392
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,910
Wow, their portions are big.

393
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,980
Please eat.

394
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,560
Although I haven't even eaten yet, I feel like I'm getting younger already.

395
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,330
Is this the strength of collagen?

396
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,250
Seeing that it's very chewy, I think the collagen is very strong.

397
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,790
What are you doing?

398
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,330
Can't you see Professor Yu here?

399
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,210
Drink up.

400
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:51,400
Ah! Why is he so petty and eating it all so quickly?

401
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,510
Mind your own business and eat up the collagen.

402
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,480
Can I say something?

403
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Of course!

404
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,910
Thank you for your hard work in dealing with the incident caused by the new professor.

405
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:17,030
On behalf of Park Cheol Jin,

406
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,190
I will apologize.

407
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,130
I apologize.

408
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,440
So you know.

409
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,630
Why are you apologizing instead of him?

410
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,400
If your brother causes trouble,

411
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,300
you have to apologize for him.

412
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,120
Drink this.

413
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,330
Plus, there isn't such a way in Korea.

414
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,580
It's not your fault.

415
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,900
The legs...

416
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,710
You can't even flip me over. Whom do you think you can catch?

417
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,040
So that b*tch asked me to wash her underwear.

418
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,000
She said she was the leader or something.

419
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,290
Do you know what happened to her underwear because I didn't get down on my knees?

420
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,160
I ripped it up into pieces, didn't I?

421
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:10,120
Mom, I asked you if you really didn't do it.

422
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:17,850
Hey, do you know how much she complained? You only get two pairs of underwear here.

423
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,710
Mom!

424
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,240
Anyway, so she tried to steal another pair of underwear.

425
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,130
Mom!

426
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,320
Why are you yelling at me b*tch?

427
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,740
What are you so serious about regarding me suddenly?

428
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,220
Do you believe me if I say that I didn't do it?

429
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,430
You don't believe what I say either, just like the attorney.

430
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,340
What are you saying! I'm your daughter.

431
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:55,930
You really don't run a gambling business or anything like that, do you?

432
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,650
No, I didn't. I said I didn't!

433
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,650
I said I didn't do it!

434
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:06,290
Hey, think about it. They change their website a dozen times a day.

435
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,060
Then they reopen it and then get rid of it again.

436
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,830
Do you think that is possible with my brain?

437
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,840
It's not you, right?

438
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,170
If it happens to be you,

439
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,360
then I really won't see you again.

440
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,510
Why? To do what?

441
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,830
Hey! Oh Kang Hui!

442
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,900
Even if you didn't see my welcoming ceremony, I will let you see my graduation ceremony.

443
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,370
Hey, Kang Seon Ho!

444
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,200
Why don't you answer the phone?

445
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,500
I was busy training here.

446
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,730
Why? What's going on?

447
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,550
- I have to do this investigation too.
- Huh?

448
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,420
I'll do it too. This investigation with you and Professor Yu.

449
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,620
Even if they say that my mom is a criminal,

450
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,080
I have to get to know it myself.

451
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,180
Kang Hui, I couldn't explain it to you but...

452
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,010
this investigation is really more dangerous than you think.

453
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,190
From the age of five when my mom first went to prison until now, my life has been in danger.

454
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,730
I'm not even afraid of that.

455
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,200
There is only one thing I am afraid of in my life.

456
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,050
It's me running away.

457
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,390
I won't run away so I will catch all those bastards,

458
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,910
and save my mom.

459
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,800
I'll talk to Professor Yu.

460
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:59,860
And, I like you too Kang Seon Ho.

461
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,760
I told you that I won't run away now.

462
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:16,560
♫ When I see you, time stops ♫

463

Go on with the talk you had earlier.

476
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,630
You said that you had been in a relationship even though you

477
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,910
aren't married even at this age.

478
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,130
Just tell me, alright?

479
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,490
Who was it? Was she pretty?

480
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,130
She was the ugliest in our station.

481
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,560
I wondered who would date her.

482
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,590
It was right in front of me.

483
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,530
I would have been pissed if she was pretty.

484
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,410
Why did she have to be ugly?

485
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,670
Why did you break up?

486
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,570
Did it change like in movies?

487
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,390
- An accident.
- Accident?

488
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,390
- Eun Ju!
- Calm down.

489
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:33,640
Eun Ju! Eun Ju!

490
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,760
She was chasing the culprits behind the illegal gambling website.

491
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,040
At the intersection, she slammed into a car that violated the traffic signal.

492
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,680
The ending is similar to mine.

493
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,460
It must have been hard. How did you hang in there?

494
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,160
Just with the

495
00:41:54,890 --> 00:42:01,850
resolution that I would finish the work that she couldn't.

496
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,410
How did you hang in there?

497
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,540
Me?

498
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,520
I changed because the world wouldn't change.

499
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,360
So? Are you trying to become a police officer again

500
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,880
instead of being a professor to finish what Eun Ju couldn't?

501
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:42,890
At first, it was because of that, and then it was because Cheol Jin got hurt.

502
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,690
Now,

503
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,750
I am also by your side now.

504
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,150
I'm doing it because I don't want another guy to get hurt.

505
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,840
Just be a professor.

506
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,760
- You scared me!
- You're just one of many cops in this world.

507
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,210
Just be a professor.

508
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,600
I also want to do so.

509
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,000
But wherever I go

510
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,450
people always get hurt or die if they are around me.

511
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:26,280
So, I want to be just a detective.

512
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,970
Professor Yu Dong Man

513
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,820
New Message

514
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,920
Kang Seon Ho – Sleep tight.

515
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,910
I sent it by mistake.
Good night.

516
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,950
I'll practice really hard and will definitely be helpful in your investigation.

517
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:07,090
Case Outline

518
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,350
Case Overview

519
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,400
Yu Dong Man

520
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,540
My eyes...

521
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,330
What's that?

522
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,320
I got the driver's license.

523
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,270
Stop it now.

524
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:02,960
Among us, only Seon Ho and Beom Tae didn't make it.

525
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,510
Who cares? You get three chances in life. Isn't that so, Beom Tae?

526
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:11,640
That's right. I took my college entrance exam three times too. Of course, I have to take the driver's license test three times as well.

527
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,980
Also, my dad said he would lend me his car if I get my license.

528
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,930
What? Daebak! Are you serious?

529
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,050
What is it? Made in Korea? Grey color?

530
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,100
Oh, that's right. Beom Tae, your family is a known rich family in Asan, right?

531
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,850
Wait a moment.

532
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,700
Is there any other Beom Tae in this school?

533
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,490
- No.
- It's not true.

534
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,050
What is this?

535
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,330
Kang Hui, did you wear perfume?

536
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:46,290
No.

537
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,570
It must be the smell of her shampoo.

538
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,800
Pathetic guy. You couldn't get even a driver's license.

539
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,150
I passed the technical and written exams, I just failed driving on the road.

540
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:07,130
Shut up and follow me.

541
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,560
Hey! This jerk! This is not a joke.
Driver training

542
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,550
Won't you go faster?

543
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,200
I am going. Why are you yelling?

544
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,330
We are on the shoulder of the road.

545
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:32,060
Turn on your signal, change lanes, and step on the accelerator, punk.

546
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,860
Don't you know it's illegal to go slower than the speed limit?

547
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,820
You're frustrating me.

548
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,630
♫ and let's run All Ready Go farther than anyone else ♫

549
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,130
What is that b*stard?!

550
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,280
Eh? What?

551
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,030
Yes, Hello. I'm on Dangjin-ro 12-gil right now.

552
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,400
I can see a vehicle that looks like they are drunk driving.

553
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,090
The car's plate number is...

554
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:03,300
Take the left side already!

555
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,560
♫ We're going to challenge ourselves every day. We're going to be burning. ♫

556
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,120
8773.

557
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:13,550
60 Ru. That Ru for license plates. 8773.

558
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,830
Since we'll arrive later,

559
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,710
send me the numbers surrounding you quickly.

560
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,990
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

561
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:22,470
You heard, right?

562
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,790
But could it be a drunk driver in the middle of the day?

563
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,890
- It looks like they are driving in the lane properly.
- You punk!

564
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,190
After seeing that person cause an accident ...

565
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,530
will you realize only after seeing an article about

566
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,670
the death of a family member from a drunk driver?

567
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:40,250
♫ Fly away high until the end ♫

568
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,690
♫ The hot sun isn't in that sky there ♫

569
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:48,180
♫ I found it (I found it) in my heart (in my heart) ♫

570
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,440
Do we keep going?

571
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,690
Focus on the car. Keep focused.

572
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,020
Good, good. You're doing fine.

573
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,690
Don't get nervous.

574
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:07,330
You are doing well.

575
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,270
What would you have done if we got into an accident?

576
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:28,620
Ah there is no way that would happen. I am there with you.

577
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:35,110
Ah this jerk. Look at your crooked eyes.

578
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,530
Thanks to you I think I will drive very well hereafter.

579
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,860
Ah that's good to hear.

580
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,500
There's at least one thing you can use that you learned from me.

581
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,820
It's just that everything you saw and learned while investigating with me is

582
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,190
backward and not the standard. I want you to forget about all that.

583
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,740
From now on, as a police university student,

584
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,230
just remember what you learn from your professors. Got it?

585
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,900
Ah, I don't want to.

586
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,150
I learned it through so much hard work. Why would I forget it!

587
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,630
I will remember everything and use it all.

588
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:11,360
Listen to me, you jerk.

589
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,080
Like a 20-year-old, go fall in love, travel, and fight a little bit.

590
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,180
Live your youth with some fun.

591
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,100
Life isn't all about investigating.

592
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,700
Ah, and practice judo really hard.

593
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,480
I am already doing it well.

594
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,130
And it's not just the investigation.

595
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,360
It's an investigation that I am doing with you.

596
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,370
You also taught me judo and driving so that I can follow you well, Professor.

597
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,590
I will work hard this vacation.

598
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,710
So, call me if you get any information. I'll come immediately.

599
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,580
Okay?

600
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,330
Okay. I got it.

601
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,900
You also spend your vacation well, with fun.

602
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,630
What is it?

603
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,100
- What's going on?
- What?

604
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,530
You've been smirking to yourself since earlier.

605
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,170
Bro, what's going on?

606
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:45,690
I'm just looking forward to the vacation.

607
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,710
It makes you happy just thinking about it, right?

608
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,260
It makes me so happy, right?

609
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,220
So, do you have plans?

610
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,220
Yeah.

611
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,240
- Studying investigations.
- St—

612
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,100
Studying...?

613
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,870
You should go to the hospital first during vacation.

614
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,950
Did you find out anything?

615
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,810
Yes. It's about the photo of the bill you sent to me.

616
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,820
There's something different about the electricity bill.

617
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:33,250
Well, it could be nothing, but something about it makes me a little uncomfortable.

618
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,520
What is it?

619
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:39,860
It would be much better to use contract power for general use if it was about the size of Gossi Beer,

620
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,690
but it was registered for a more expensive industrial purpose.

621
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:46,430
Why would he do that?

622
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,180
PC cafes or Bitcoin mining kids.

623
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,020
These guys, who have to pay outrageous electricity bills,

624
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,740
know how to use this trick well.

625
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,340
They want to reduce their electricity bill compared to the amount of electricity they really use.

626
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,520
Why?

627
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:54,890
The burner cell phone tower was captured, but the location keeps changing.

628
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,590
There is a program that figures out call patterns and frequency.

629
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:02,880
If we investigate using that, I think we'll be able to figure out the actual phone call locations.

630
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,940
Are you filming a James Bond movie?

631
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,660
It is used by the FBI, so we can code it too.

632
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,160
It will take a while though.

633
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,100
About two weeks.

634
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,990
It was you?

635
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:32,230
You were right under my nose!

636
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:39,320
Professor Go, you son of a b*tch.

637

You'll be forwarded to voicemail.

Why isn't he answering the phone?

640
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:09,190
Where are you? You should see my license in person.

641
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,100
Seon Ho! Before we leave, they want everyone to return the laptops.

642
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,380
Oh, that's right. Okay.

643
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,380
I need to transfer a file first.

Seon Ho.

654
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,670
What are you talking about?

655
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,620
I just came back from the club room,

656
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,060
and Professor Seo Sang Hak said that.

657
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,380
Letter of resignation

658
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:30,210
It's Yu Dong Man.

659
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:36,880
You asked me that question last time.

660
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,480
Are you going to be a professor or a detective?

661
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,610
You said I had to choose.

662
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,520
To be honest, I thought it wouldn't

663
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,570
be that bad to become a professor.

664
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:09,710
But I was actually learning from the students,

665
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,610
embarrassingly.

666
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,220
I thought it would be better to catch people

667
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,440
who were less than me than to teach those who are

668
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,330
better than me.

669
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:30,980
So, I'm going back to being a detective, instead of being a professor.

670
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,280
It can't be. It can't be.

671
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,290
You rude jerk.

672
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:17,000
Don't you know how to knock?

673
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:21,090
What? Now what? Why is your face like that?

674
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:55,010
Professor Seo Sang Hak, please take care

675
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,560
of our losers.

676
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,430
Professor ...

677
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:20,790
♫ I guess you see a different me ♫

678
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:27,840
♫ The one person who resembles me, that’s you ♫

679
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:34,820
♫ When you look at me, when you touch me ♫

680
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:43,140
♫ I feel the reason for opening my eyes every day
That reason is you ♫

681
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:49,160
♫ Even when I was pushed around and fell down ♫

682
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:56,420
♫ You helped me get back up ♫

683
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:04,600
♫ Not just for one moment
But you make me live for a long time ♫

684
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,720
Police University

685
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,650
I was trying to help solve your case, chasing after the ones involved in the illegal gambling site.

686
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,260
It got a little dangerous.

687
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:15,840
What kind of crazy bastard messed with my daughter?

688
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,290
Please tell him if you see him, that it will take a week to process a resignation.

689
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:23,780
Where else would he have gone? I'm sure he is wherever the culprit is.

690
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,830
- Okay. Let's go!
- Let's go!

691
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:28,090
Who is it? Isn't he from that room?

692
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,210
I saw his face, and it was him.

693
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,390
As soon as it's cleaned up, I'll go overseas.

694
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,420
I called because I have something to tell you.

695
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,980
The last location where it turned off was in Changrin-dong.

696
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,940
If we do it now, we can catch those illegal gambling jerks,

697
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,290
I'll head out there first.
