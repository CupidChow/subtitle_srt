00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,460
Episode 4

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,600
If you can't stop Yu Dong Man, know that it's over for you, too.

3
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,720
Incoming call: My one and only Mentor
Accept Call | Reject Call

4
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,470
What is it?

5
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,770
You rude jerk.

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,950
Hey, it's raining, do you want to go get samgyeopsal (3-layer pork belly)?

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,780
Mentor.

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,650
What? Why are calling me like that? What's wrong?

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,590
You aren't going to give up, right?

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,920
What? Hey, speak in a way that I can understand.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,170
You really aren't going to give up chasing those guys, right?

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,290
Hey, you bastard. How long have you known me?

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,220
Where are you? Did you drink?

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,200
Shall I pick you up?

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,090
The ones that you are after, from the gambling site,

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,090
they're at Police University—

17
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,700
Hey, Cheol Jin.

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,630
Cheol Jin. Park Cheol Jin!

19
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,530
Cheol Jin!

20
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,740
Emergency Center

21
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,040
Cheol Jin! Cheol Jin! Cheol Jin!

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,140
Park Cheol Jin? Cheol Jin!

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,560
- Call the anesthesiologist!
- Okay.

24
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,500
I have a very bad feeling about this case.

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,560
At that time, you said you would always watch my back.

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,180
It still hurts a lot when it rains.

27
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,000
Even now, I turn around, scared that someone is standing behind me.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,510
So, don't leave me alone.

29
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,770
I can't stop the bleeding.

30
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,730
Cheol Jin.

31
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,300
Cheol Jin.

32
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,610
Surgery Center
Authorized Personnel Only
Staff Only

33
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,950
You said you were the last person on the phone with him.

34
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,230
Did you hear anything?

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,250
Hey you, punk.

36
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,100
The illegal gambling site.

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,880
Those sons of bitches. I'm going to catch them.

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,440
I'll catch them no matter what!

39
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,640
Hey you, jerk, just calm down.

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,570
Eun Ju died because of those bastards.

41
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,010
Cheol Jin got hurt, so how am I supposed to calm down?! How can I?!

42
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,850
I need to catch those bastards.

43
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,880
I will catch them no matter what

44
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,950
and make them pay for this!

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,960
Dong Man!

46
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,210
We have

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,170
We have to protect everyone.

48
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,420
Black Net
hackeryoon

49
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,380
Bird has logged off.

50
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,390
He's not online.

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,830
Let's meet up, Hyung.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,650
Do not enter – Police line – Investigation in progress

53
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,920
- Professor.
- Kang Seon Ho.

54
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,340
Yes?

55
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,310
You told me you would do anything if I helped you?

56
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,730
Help me.

57
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,770
- What?
- Help me

58
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,590
catch those bastards.

59
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,370
- What are you saying—
- With your hacking skills, we can catch those guys!

60
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,490
Yoon.

61
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,700
Yoon?!

62
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,420
- Don't tell me...
- Yes.

63
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,570
I am

64
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,150
Bird.

65
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,410
What?!

66
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,230
Wait a minute! He said he was a college student and a computer science major.

67
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,360
If a hacker says he's a cop, he'll be thrown out.

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,090
At first, I also was

69
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,780
on the Black Net to get some information, but

70
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,060
I just happened to chat with you there.
- So you lied to me for a year?!

71
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,150
Hey, you punk, I didn't lie. I just missed the timing to tell you.

72
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,650
Since when did you know I was Yoon?

73
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,250
At the police station? Or here?

74
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,260
You don't have to believe me if you don't want to,

75
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,580
but I just found out.

76
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,510
Also, I was just as taken aback as you are by the fact that you are Yoon.

77
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,950
So I was just going to pretend that I didn't know,

78
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,800
but I was going to...

79
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,550
but Cheol Jin got hurt.

80
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,980
I think it was the guys from the gambling site you robbed.

81
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,210
If you can help me a little with hacking, then I think I can catch them in no time. So—

82
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,290
So, is that why you let me get into this school?

83
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,060
Hey you, punk!

84
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,220
If I help you, is that legal?

85
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,010
Once a criminal. The second time is easy.

86
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,860
You said you don't even feel bad the third time!

87
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,390
You said that to me!

88
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,580
So, I promised you that I would not break the rules again!

89
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,450
I promised you!

90
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,230
I'll pretend I didn't hear what we just talked about.

91
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,930
One, two, one, two.

92
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,520
Bro, if you're not going to drink that yogurt,

93
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,030
I can take care of it for you.

94
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,460
Yes, you should take lactobacillus (a probiotic).

95
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,330
Yes, lactobacillus is really important.

96
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,160
- I'm leaving first.
- What?

97
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:16,430
Our nice guy is very feisty today.

98
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,630
In Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil's class,

99
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,550
it was a bit awkward for Seon Ho.

100
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,610
Last night he didn't sleep at all.

101
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,150
It seemed like he was rummaging through books.

102
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,100
You look terrible.

103
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,550
Your face looks terrible.

104
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,140
To be honest, Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil went too far yesterday.

105
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,340
I mean, if you are that scary and ask a question, who's going to be able to answer properly?

106
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,970
I'm sure most of these guys in this class would have done the same as you.

107
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,190
So, you don't have to be discouraged.

108
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,190
Thank you.

109
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,590
But I never really thought about it.

110
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,260
Who the police are, what they protect.

111
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,800
What I think about it.

112
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,760
Then can't you start searching for that from now on?

113
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,210
We just entered school and only just started.

114
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,360
That's true. You're right.

115
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,410
We just are getting started.

116
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:34,190
By the way, what you said to me on the day the Cheongram training ended.

117
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,160
I did come to this school because of you.

118
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,050
For you.

119
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,450
Huh? What?

120
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,780
Attention!

121
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,400
Due to Professor Yu Dong Man's personal emergency, this class is unfortunately canceled.

122
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,170
Mr. Hyeon here will tell you about the curriculum that will take place over the next semester,

123
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,030
and the course books that you will need.

124
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,250
We will let you know when the make-up class has been rescheduled.

125
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,600
I won't be taking any questions.

126
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,870
The first orientation class was canceled?

127
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,720
It must have been a very urgent matter.

128
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,410
He notified me by phone.

129
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,550
He must submit a statement for the reason and a supplementary plan separately.

130
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,010
Could he be sick?

131
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,210
Even if you're sick, you should still teach your class.

132
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,630
Even if the students are sick, they still have to attend class.

133
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,010
Isn't he missing a qualification as a professor?

134
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,860
Shall we start the meeting for now?

135
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,900
It's a cerebral hemorrhage. The surgery went well, for now,

136
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,340
but we will have to wait and see in terms of him regaining consciousness.

137
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,460
He will regain conscious, right?

138
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,090
I can't guarantee it at this point.

139
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,040
Hey, Dong Man, you didn't eat, right?

140
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,310
- Please bring me back.
- Hey punk, it's out of my hands.

141
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,680
The paperwork is all done.

142
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,420
- Excuse me, Team Leader.
- What?

143
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,620
- Sir, do you trust me?
- Why are you doing this? It's scaring me.

144
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,640
I trust you, sir.

145
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,880
What else are you trying to say?

146
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,180
I think Cheol Jin caught the illegal gambling site connection we were chasing.

147
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,670
What?!

148
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,010
And? Keep talking.

149
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,110
I think I have to get back together with you to investigate this case.

150
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,520
I think that Cheol Jin got critical evidence.

151
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,630
Why? What did Cheol Jin say?

152
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,540
I think there is something going on at National Police University.

153
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,070
The guys involved in the illegal gambling site,

154
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,160
I think they are at National Police University.

155
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,740
- Are you the one who was injured and not Cheol Jin?
- Team Leader!

156
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,590
It was time to acknowledge that even bullshit spoken seriously can make a conversation, you ass!

157
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,990
It's real! That's what Cheol Jin said on the phone!

158
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,430
Damn it! You pathetic bastard!

159
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,860
Cheol Jin's unconscious!

160
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,030
This jerk, when are you going to grow up?! When are you going to grow up?!

161
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,790
How could you use a sick person...? You crazy bastard. And you're a mentor! Come on!

162
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,030
I'm telling you the truth! That's what Cheol Jin really said.

163
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,150
- Don't follow me!
-That's what Cheol Jin said!

164
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,190
You seriously...

165
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,060
Tea Ceremony Club
Multi-scented

166
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,380
I heard the best part of campus is the clubs.

167
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,000
- Have you guys decided where you're joining?
- Here!

168
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,990
The forensic investigation research club, with Professor Seo Sang Hak, Sci-Re Lab SCIence REsearch).

169
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,450
Others say that there are a lot of administration professors,

170
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,970
but in fact, it is the only club that solves homework on

171
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,360
- fingerprints, blood, and DNA.
- No!

172
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,840
I heard there's a goddess in the dance club.

173
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,390
A goddess!

174
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,150
Really? Where can I sign up for the dance club?

175
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,950
That's right.

176
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,870
If you want to meet a goddess, join the judo club.

177
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,250
Oh, you scared me.

178
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,170
If you come to the judo club, I'm there. Me.

179
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,690
Oh, I see.

180
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,270
What is this? What is this? You can see he has the face for judo club.

181
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,690
What's our baby's name? Seon Ho? Kang Seon Ho.

182
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,310
I'm going to join the student council. You too, right?

183
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,740
Huh? Yes, the sunbaes told me to join. I also thought it would be interesting.

184
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,590
I heard there are only two spots left.

185
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,990
Are you rivals now?

186
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,100
Hey, we can both get in. Here it is, let's hurry.

187
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,470
- What's your phone number?
- Phone number. Phone number.

188
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,360
Seon Ho.

189
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,070
If you want to win her love, join the judo club.

190
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,660
Ah, Professor...

191
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,970
The strong get the beauty. You know that, right?

192
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,650
Why are you doing this?

193
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,560
I remember you said you wanted to improve your stamina during the interview!

194
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,450
Your actions can't be different from your words.

195
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,600
Quickly write down his name.

196
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,790
I will think about it a little more. I'm sorry.

197
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,400
Did you write it down?

198
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,830
What were you doing not writing it down?

199
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,760
Student Council Room

200
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,220
- He's tall and has good grades.
- Oh, really?

201
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,340
Applications? You can leave them there.

202
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,920
Oh, you know, it's based on grades, right? Fighting!

203
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,720
Do you think you'll make it?

204
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,910
Student Council Application Form

205
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,190
Our police officers use guns to protect people,

206
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,350
not to kill people.

207
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,580
I think it would be very delightful if you learn accurate and safe shooting skills

208
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,970
by engraving "Life-long student" in your heart, not "One shot kill."
(TN: In Korean the two phrases differ by one syllable

209
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,090
Please demonstrate.

210
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,680
Take deep breaths.

211
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,890
Exhale from the top, slowly placing your arm with the gun in the line of sight.

212
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,460
When you get to the vertical line, you hold your breath,

213
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,060
adjust the height of the gunsight and the bead

214
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,070
and focus!

215
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,420
Shoot.

216
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,060

218
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,280
Miranda Rule

219
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,260
This is a book about the Miranda Rule principles,

220
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,090
and I thought it would be good to take a look.

221
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,830
Thanks.

222
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,200
But don't look at all of it.

223
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,600
Look at this chapter.

224
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,840
Kang Hui's hand touched mine.

225
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,790
This was Miranda's first offense.

226
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,030
Kang Hui's hand.

227
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,630
Kang Hui's hand.
- The judge said ...

228
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,460
Are you listening?

229
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,560
Hey! Kang Seon Ho!

230
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,200
Are you not going to focus?

231
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,110
I'm sorry. Can you explain it one more time?

232
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,830
Read here.

233
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,960
According to the rule, without the warning, the suspect's statement cannot be used as evidence.

234
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,940
More on the next page, but you need to read it yourself.

235
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,930
- You have to memorize this.
- Oh, okay.

236
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,960
Earlier, it seemed like Oh Kang Hui and Kang Seon Ho have something going on, right?

237
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,330
In any case, birds of a feather flock together, (like attracts like), right?

238
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,990
Can't you see that I'm studying?

239
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,630
Oh. I'm sorry.

240
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,390
There's no more consideration or concession to Jo Jun Wuk!

241
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,900
Come on, you don't have to do that between friends.

242
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,700
There are no friends when it comes to love!

243
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,110
No, there's no fair play.

244
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,800
It's a war from now on.

245
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,770
I can do it! I can do it!

246
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,690
Wow, you're really going to be this childish?

247
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,140
If you're done eating, let's talk for a minute.

248
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,210
Do you like Kang Hui?

249
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,610
Yes. You do, too, right?

250
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,200
Since when?

251
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,980
Before I got into this school.

252
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,780
What about you?

253
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,370
Much earlier than you.

254
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,550
Witness, please come in.

255
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,340
2 years ago

256
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,370
Th-That wench.

257
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,950
Witness Stand

258
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,930
I don't remember exactly, but I do remember people were walking around midnight.

259
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,150
Witness, then have you ever seen

260
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,800
the defendant, your mother,

261
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,570
remodel the storage room and operating a gambling room?

262
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,690
Yes.

263
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,710
Every night. Also, it was night after night.

264
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,040
Even on the exam days and before the judo competitions!

265
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,930
That woman, that man, and over there, too.

266
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,950
Oh, that uncle over there.

267
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,090
Your Honor. For the people who remodeled a normal residence

268
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,740
and turned it into an illegal gambling site, including my mother,

269
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,600
I ask you to give them the highest punishment this court allows.

270
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,670
Please, I am begging you.

271
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,380
Then Kang Seon Ho, I guess we can't even be friends.

272
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,780
Okay, Park Min Gyu.

273
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,760
- There won't be fair play.
- There won't be any.

274
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,530
- Really?
- Holy...

275
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,950
Isn't it really something?

276
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,580
What the heck? Why so quiet suddenly? Were you talking about me?

277
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,500
Cleanliness is a must in the living quarters.

278
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,510
Begin inspection!

279
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,370
Evening roll call! Two people in total, two people are present. There are no issues.

280
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,520
Do it again.

281
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,220
Do it over!

282
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,350
Something amazing happened.

283
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,870
Do it over!

284
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,160
Unbelievable.

285
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,680
Seon Ho. Seon Ho.

286
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:01,960
A total surprise. Have you heard about Oh Kang Hui?

287
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,430
Kang Hui's mother has four prior convictions. All for illegal gambling.

288
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:11,490
- What?
- I heard she got arrested in front of the school on our interview day.

289
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,250
My goodness...

290
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,860
They handcuffed her.

291
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,370
Kids have been talking about it since last night.

292
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,700
They are saying how can the daughter of a criminal become a police officer?

293
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,720
How can you say something like—

294
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,500
Oh my god.

295
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,990
I think Kang Hui heard it all.

296
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,040
No can do.

297
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Just this week. I am in a desperate situation.

298
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,760
What about the written excuse for last week's absence and the makeup lessons? Did you bring them, Professor?

299
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,770
Administrator.

300
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,650
I'll come back later.

301
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,960
I'll bring the written excuse along with this week's lesson plan.

302
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,970
Professor Yu.

303
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,820
Are you going to cancel the class again?

304
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,660
I have a very urgent matter.

305
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,170
What's more urgent than for an instructor to teach students?

306
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,100
I'm ashamed to say,

307
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,580
but I really have an urgent matter.

308
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,820
Then you should just leave.

309
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,970
It seems you have no professional ethics. Don't ruin it for the other instructors.

310
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,410
You should just resign and leave.

311
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,390
I understand everthing you are saying.

312
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:44,540
But who are you to tell me to resign?

313
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,300
This is the last piece of advice I am giving pathetic you out of courtesy.

314
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,880
Leave this school quietly.

315
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,680
Did you just drop the honorifics?

316
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,620
What are you two doing while the students are watching?

317
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,730
Here. Drink it.

318
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,690
I thought you had sorted your feelings out.

319
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,920
Dealing with the academy and the students...

320
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,270
I thought you felt differently now.

321
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,320
The field officers coming into the academy

322
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,010
usually have a hard time adjusting in the beginning.

323
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,390
But still, you shouldn't be like this.

324
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,280
My partner is hurt, and he's unconscious.

325
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,930
This week is the golden time for us to catch at least their tail.

326
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:53,920
I know I shouldn't be like this, but I am asking. Just once, I am asking for your leniency.

327
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,800
I understand.

328
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,880
But don't you think you ought to make a choice now?

329
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,870
Whether to teach or to be a detective.

330
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,630
You are sleeping too long.

331
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,020
No, keep sleeping.

332
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:58,410
I'll work day and night to catch the bastard who did this to you.

333
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,060
You just sleep comfortably.

334
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,590
To be honest, I was getting used to the school.

335
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,900
It was fun watching those idiots.

336
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,110
My heart felt warm thinking I was like that once, too.

337
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,130
But I did promise I'd keep you safe.

338
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,470
So, I came to you again.

339
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,060
So what I am saying is...

340
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,650
Don't sleep too long.

341
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,540
What the hell am I saying to a sleeping person?

342
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,470
Get lost! Oh Kang Hui!
Criminal Investigation
It's embarrassing to be from the same university!!

343
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,900
The daughter of a felon!!!
Leave school!
You inherited the blood of a criminal!

344
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,520
They're driving me crazy.

345
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,720
This is so crazy, f***ed up!

346
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,010
Who the hell...?

347
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,750
What the heck?

348
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,120
Get lost! Oh Kang Hui!
Criminal Investigation
It's embarrassing to be from the same university!!
The daughter of a felon!!!

349
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,210
Leave school!
You inherited the blood of a criminal!
Oh Kang Hui

350
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,830
Vicious criminal's daughter

351
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,240
Why is it still dirty after being erased?

352
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,490
♫ Time stops ♫

353
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:51,760
♫ I can't do anything ♫

354
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,670
Hey, punk!

355
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,860
A few days ago Cheol Jin got hurt.

356
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,150
I think I was out of my mind for a while.

357
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,850
It's up to me to catch those bastards.

358
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,930
What I am saying is

359
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,510
forget about what I said then.

360
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,270
See ya.

361
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,910
Isn't that really crazy? She pretended to be the world's most noble person.

362
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,220
She's really not taking any time off from school?

363
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,860
She is brazenly riding it out. That's what she saw and learned.

364
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,520
Do you think she'll let her mom slide when she becomes a police officer?

365
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,530
I won't let her slide. If you commit a crime, then you should wear the handcuffs, even if that is my mother.

366
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,310
And if you got something to say, then say it face to face.

367
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,100
Don't do it behind my back like the rats.

368
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,940
Hey, watch your mouth.

369
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,120
It was you guys who didn't watch your mouths.

370
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,350
What could you have learned from your gambling mother?

371
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,160
Let's go.

372
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,530
Leadership Room

373
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,590
Baek Hui, I think you have to check the notice board.

374
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,580
Why, what's wrong?

375
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,690
Look at this. Isn't this surprising?

376
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,300
- I know, right?
- What?

377
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,770
This is really crazy! Take a look.

378
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,290
- What?
- Look at this.

379
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,580
Kang Hui must be really upset.

380
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,320
- Hey, what to do, Seon Ho?
- What is it?

381
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,210
My daughter says she will die before me.

382
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,060
What?

383
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,830
Did you know that a freshman 'Oh Kang Hui' s mother has been convicted for gambling four times?

384
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,150
Children are said to be the mirror of their parents. If Oh Kang Hui, who was raised by such parents

385
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,790
becomes a police officer, I am worried that the citizen's trust in the police will be lowered.

386
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,420
Did you know that a freshman 'Oh Kang Hui' s mother has been convicted for gambling four times?

387
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,440
Let's stop seeing each other, please!

388
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,530
When was this uploaded?

389
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,900
Where is Kang Hui?

390
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,080
Cool yourself down.

391
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,350
Get lost!
It's embarrassing to be from the same school!!!

392
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,670
Leave school!

393
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,610
You find me uncomfortable, right?

394
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,410
No.

395
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah. I made a mistake during the Cheongram training.

396
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,700
If you do that, you take away the opportunity for me to solve the problem.

397
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,250
It's hard to get close to the person

398
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,460
who points out your mistake.

399
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,710
That is because of my mother.

400
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,650
Whenever exams were near, she would bring the answers and

401
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,630
make me memorize them.

402
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,100
Not how to get the solution, just memorize the answer.

403
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,950
Later, I get the answer whenever I see the question,

404
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,400
but I don't know why that is the answer.

405
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,450
Your mother is the problem in your house too.

406
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,650
Do you know that this is the first time

407
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,630
we've spoken this much after becoming roommates?

408
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,720
Even friendship is not visible in the battlefield.

409
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,770
Our school takes care of issues quickly.

410
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,480
Did you see it?

411
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,030
The shocking secret of freshman Oh!
This post has been deleted.

412
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,200
Criminal Investigation

413
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,650
GREAT
LOVE
Oh Kang Hui

414
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,490
Hey Kang Seon Ho!

415
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,410
But, how did you know?

416
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,590
The concept was just your style.

417
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,850
Why?

418
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,560
- Was it disgusting again?
- A bit.

419
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,420
And it was very childish.

420
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,630
It was moderately nice.

421
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,380
What about professor Gwon Hyeok Pil's question?

422
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,340
Did you get it now?

423
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,950
Not yet.

424
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,570
What you said

425
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,710
during class, "We are police,

426
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,790
so we should do anything possible to save everyone."

427
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,550
I felt guilty about it.

428
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,640
When I was in 11th grade,

429
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,420
my mom had a trial.

430
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,440
The prosecutor wanted me to stand as a witness.

431
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,250
So I testified

432
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,560
that my mom was guilty.

433
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,400
The people who did bad things with my mom,

434
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,390
bought lawyers.

435
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,320
But my mom didn't have money

436
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,090
and looked like she had to accept the entire blame.

437
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,500
Thats why I said that everyone did the crime.

438
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,160
That my mom did so too.

439
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,670
I did that to protect my mom,

440
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,600
but I wonder if I protected only my mother.

441
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:45,160
Let me ask you a favor. A jerk like me can't earn that much money even if I die and come back alive.

442
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,450
But you can do it.

443
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,140
Let them go this once.

444
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,060
Please.

445
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,430
Help me.

446
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,930
Cheol Jin got hurt a few days ago

447
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,230
so I must have gone crazy for a moment.

448
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,480
At that time,

449
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,690
that would have been your best decision.

450
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,260
And, I

451
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,860
don't think that is wrong.

452
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,080
We have to go and get ready for the evening roll call.

453
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,070
Can you go ahead. I have to drop by somewhere first.

454
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,940
Where?

455
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,440
Yes.

456
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,610
If I start now, I can be there in ten minutes, so please wait.

457
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:52,460
Do not enter - Police line - Investigation in progress

458
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,410
Kim Dong Wun Chunnam 90-Ja 1398 010-0043-9930

459
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,260
Yes.

460
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,170
Professor's Office

461
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,770
Professor, I have to tell you something—

462
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,600
Later.

463
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,590
- What are you doing?
- Not later.

464
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,690
I have to ask you right now.

465
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,780
Get off. Get off quickly.

466
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,150
I have something to ask you.

467
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,880
You were the one who didn't get off.

468
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,670
Professor.

469
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,610
I heard you met all the truck drivers here for a week.

470
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,460
This is a parking lot for trucks,

471
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,400
so I'm sure it was crazy.

472
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,440
And you met with all those drivers.

473
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,950
- This is it.
- Thank you.

474
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,440
I will return it as soon as I go through it.

475
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,420
It was pouring rain that night

476
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,630
so I don't know what it would have recorded.

477
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,290
Oh my goodness, they didn't

478
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,870
lay down pavement on this side,

479
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,380
so the ground is just all muddy.

480
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,840
The car becomes a mess when it rains. An absolute mess.

481
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,160
What are you doing?

482
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:26,910
20:57:14 (8:57 pm military time).

483
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,030
20:57:

484
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,850
34.

485
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,840
It's a dark gray sedan.

486
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,500
The number is four seven...

487
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,670
- What is the rest?
- Isn't it four

488
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,870
- one?
- Huh?

489
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,160
It's me. I'll send you a file now,

490
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,310
Analyze the video, and get the car model and license plate number. Okay?

491
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,050
Where are we going again?

492
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,100
Aren't we going to school?

493
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,970
Where did he go?

494
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,050
It's almost time for the evening roll call.

495
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,040
What is all this?

496
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,320
Miranda rule

497
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,400
Miranda?

498
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,680
Don't you know I will get punished if I get caught going out without permission?

499
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,400
If you're going to be like this, why follow me? I'm busy.

500
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,210
Local Government Office

501
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,370
Are we going to the police station now?

502
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,850
Yes.

503
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,180
Why?

504
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,420
Something smells fishy.

505
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,620
I'm telling you something smells fishy.

506
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,740
If you're going to go up, go up. What are you doing?

507
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,100
Quiet down.

508
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,780
Oh! Detective Lee, you gained some weight.

509
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,150
Seems like you stay at the desk instead of going on site.

510
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,230
Let's go.

511
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,040
Oh! Detective Kim, I noticed in the parking lot that you changed your car.

512
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,740
Don't take any bribes. I'm watching everything.

513
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,610
I got it on a 5-year installment plan. Don't say reckless things.

514
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,700
It's a joke, a joke. Go.

515
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,600
Director!

516
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,450
Inspector Yu.

517
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,100
Thank you for last time when you tried to reassign me to my position.

518
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,750
Team Leader Choi isn't usually the type to do such things.

519
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,300
Yes.

520
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,540
It wasn't a request from him.

521
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,790
It's because I thought it was a waste.

522
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,660
I didn't want a competent person like you stuck at the school.

523
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,410
Oh, I see.

524
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,940
What are you doing here?

525
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,450
My teammate got hurt so I came by to grab his stuff.

526
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,820
Ah, Park Cheol Jin?

527
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,800
Yes.

528
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,270
The culprit was caught.

529
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,200
They're in the midst of interrogating.

530
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,530
Caught you say?

531
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:41,230
Oh! That's it! I confused it with the previous Seongsu-dong case.

532
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,310
God. You shouldn't get confused with this.

533
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,890
Right? Good night!

534
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,040
Yes. Good job.

535
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,000
Hey, let's go too.

536
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,540
What?

537
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,630
Chief Han.

538
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,670
What exactly is going on? Why did we come here?

539
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,790
Did you not notice it?

540
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,060
That expression he made when I said we caught the culprit!

541
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,740
You know it right when they are caught.

542
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,610
The facial expression in that moment can't lie.

543
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,250
I only have a hunch with no evidence.

544
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,370
So what do you plan to do?

545
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,590
There's nothing left but to wait for Cheol Jin to wake up.

546
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,020
But, what did you want to ask?

547
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,740
Later. I'll save it for later.

548
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,580
But is Cheol Jin okay?

549
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:54,300
I was truly desperate when I was gathering money for my father's medical fees.

550
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,840
Professor Yu must feel the same way right now.

551
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,490
Please wake up soon.

552
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,140
Hey, you said you had something you wanted ask. Are you just going to leave?

553
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,900
The answer. I've already received it.

554
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,610
What?

555
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:48,620
Professor, why did you do that to that criminal at the emergency room?

556
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,340
What do you mean?

557
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:55,620
"Criminals should also be protected and have rights." Is that what you believe?

558
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,100
What's so important about such things. Just do as you see fit.

559
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,060
Why complicate things and break them down?

560
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:07,020
There's nothing like that in my dictionary. We protect them and catch them. Okay?

561
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,380
To do that you'll have to work out.

562
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,700
A guy who is weak like you, what will you protect and catch?

563
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,840
Hey.

564
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,340
Do you guys want to obtain love?

565
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,420
- Of course!
- Of course!

566
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,240
Leave the Judo Club application form here.

567
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,970
Is this the time to be caring for your looks?

568
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,260
The list of applicants is so empty.

569
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,670
At my age, wrinkles are scarier than an empty list of applicants.

570
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,380
Even if you don't see them now, they show up later on.

571
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,220
I was fooled by you when I was a freshman, so what am I still doing here?

572
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,030
Tricked? What do you mean you were tricked?

573
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,770
You said the club was where the best looking guys from the campus would be.

574
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,560
There needs to be men here for that to happen.

575
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,750
I really hate you, Professor. What if our club is disbanded?

576
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,200
This is really driving me crazy...

577
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,620
I came to apply for the freshman class of Judo club.

578
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
Men are here.

579
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,080
Nice to meet you.

580
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,510
The entry test for new members is a falling technique class.

581
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,770
A test...?

582
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,820
♫ We know the path our heart's chose ♫

583
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,800
♫ A place that's far and rough ♫

584
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,260
As long as you joined the judo club, and as long as you learn from Choi Hui Su,

585
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,330
I will raise you to one of the best at the National Police University!

586
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,930
♫ We have never learned nor do we want to know. ♫

587
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,170
♫ Yeah, we're taking a deep breath with a tough look ♫

588
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,690
It might be better to just die.

589
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,620
Then she's mine.

590
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:11,740
Professor! I'd like to go one more round.

591
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,890
♫ We are faster than fast ♫

592
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:19,720
He doesn't know it yet, but I joined the public relations club, too.

593
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,650
- Okay!
- Noona Eon Ju is in the public relations club.

594
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,950
I guess we can be in two clubs.

595
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,560
No, I will try it again.

596
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,010
- I won.
- It's okay, ma'am.

597
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,500
No Beom tae is no match for me.

598
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,390
Look at him!

599
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,290
Oh right,

600
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,760
It hurts...

601
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,470
- I sent you the photos you asked for through messenger.
- No, I'm alright ma'am.

602
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,710
I'm okay!

603
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,470
Jun Wuk.

604
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,590
You are an insider, right?

605
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,870
Can you call me Taching (self-proclaiming)? Bro?

606
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:52,690
Oh, yes, Taching.

607
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:58,480
Can you collect all the pictures that the students tagged "National Police University" from Monday night, and send them to me?

608
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,850
Okay.

609
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,190
Thank you.

610
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,430
The article was posted on the bulletin board at 9:30 on Monday night.

611
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:11,200
The Wi-Fi location they used was the lobby of the dorm.

612
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,550
What?

613
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,630
Hey, have you heard?

614
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:41,350
I heard they caught the culprit who uploaded the video of Oh Kang Hui and her mom.

615
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,110
What!?

616
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,760
So it was you.

617
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,000
Such a fuss.

618
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,220
Everyone listen.

619
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,150
My daughter says she will die before me.

620
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,360
Why did you do it?

621
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,870
Then I will take this and go to the Administrator.

622
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:24,680
It was so that I could join the student council.

623
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,160
There are only two seats.

624
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,370
It's based on grades, so Oh Kang Hui has to give up in order for me to get in. What else am I going to do?

625
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,090
You did it just for something like that?

626
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,250
Something like that? Do you not know that if you get into the student council it will be much comfortable when you become a police officer?

627
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,860
If you're becoming a police officer just to be comfortable,

628
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,190
then just quit now, you shameless bastard.

629
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,310
You're not going to tell anyone, right?

630
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:51,090
You go to the student council and tell them that you won't be a part of it.

631
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,590
Or else, I'll make so that you're too embarrassed to continue attending this school.

632
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:00,350
But... how did you know it was me?

633
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,530
From your facial expression.

634
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:09,540
You look just like someone caught red-handed. You can't hide the expression that comes out at that moment.

635
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,760
Her grades are very good, but

636
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,580
we will have to reject her because she has quite a reputation.

637
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,880
Of course. We don't want to spoil the student council's reputation.

638
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,380
She must never come in.

639
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,230
She came in.

640
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,630
Please give me my papers.

641
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,520
Here. No.

642
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,090
What's the reason?

643
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,480
I won't apply for student council.

644
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,200
So there won't be a rejection, either,

645
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,050
with petty and crappy reasons.

646
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,560
Please give me my application.

647
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,220
Here.

648
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,210
Professor Yu Dong Man

649
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,130
I'm sending you the video analysis.

650
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,480
384 Na 4178

651
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,770
Yes.

652
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,400
Yeah?

653
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,580
He's conscious?

654
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,540
What about his status?

655
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,410
Heard you joined the judo team.

656
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:43,620
Yes. I need to work on my stamina.

657
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,810
Did you get in the student council?

658
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,580
No. I applied for the marketing team.

659
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:54,060
Who'd be better suited than an issue maker like me?

660
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,020
I guess the school will be full of freshman next year.

661
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,180
That is if you market it.

662
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,550
I'll show you the most competitive rate ever.

663
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,350
Now, we have Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil's class.

664
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:12,580
That's all for today's class.

665
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,990
May I answer the question

666
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:23,490
that you asked mein the last class?

667
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,260
It should be an answer that wouldn't waste my time.

668
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,580
I read a book in the library.

669
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:44,090
It was about the Miranda of the 'Miranda Rule"

670
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:47,020
which we all know well.

671
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:54,700
Ernest Miranda, a serial rapist. He confessed while being investigated for rape,

672
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,570
but the court claimed Miranda's confession was invalid

673
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:01,010
because he had not been notified of his right to appoint a lawyer or remain silent,

674
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:05,130
and he was eventually released on parole.

675
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,370
Although that ruling

676
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:11,560
has consequently established a clear principle that "justice can only be achieved through due process,"

677
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,110
it is also true that it remains at the center of controversy to this day.

678
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,370
I didn't really want to agree with that ruling either.

679
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:26,780
The rights of a criminal who kidnapped and raped an eighteen-year-old are not important.

680
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:31,510
But when we follow the rules,

681
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:34,720
when we acknowledge their rights,

682
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:41,740
won't we be able to protect the people that we actually have to protect from criminals like Miranda?

683
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,800
So my answer to your question is the same as the one I told you in the last class.

684
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,520
I think we have to protect

685
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,890
both citizens and criminals.

686
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:59,060
But by following the rules, legally

687
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:04,700
because we are police and we represent the law.

688
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,970
The ruling did not exist to protect Miranda.

689
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:40,360
It's not that the police officer was disciplined because

690
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,750
the killer, who died in the police car accident, was not innocent.

691
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:49,630
We aren't deciding with our emotions, we let it be decided by the law.

692
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,430
Understanding the world through the eyes of the law,

693
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,690
the legal mind,

694
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:01,520
is what you have to learn from my constitutional law class.

695
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,710
Kang Seon Ho,

696
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,920
good job.

697
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,340
Hangang Hospital

698
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:51,430
I didn't know a banana was this tasty.

699
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,310
Cheol Jin!

700
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,870
You!

701
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:04,280
Be gentle! My head! My head!

702
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,510
Hey! Are you all right?

703
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,250
You made me worry so much.

704
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,000
That's why you should have treated me better.

705
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,690
This guy survived.

706
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,720
- He survived, Team leader.
- Dong Man.

707
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:23,160
You remember the faces of the guys who made you like this, right?

708
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,050
What?

709
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:28,180
- Dong Man—
- Okay, maybe you were too shocked.

710
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,250
Hey, then do you remember calling me?

711
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:35,180
That something is there at Police University.

712
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,710
What?

713
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,360
Huh?

714
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,930
What?

715
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,360
Huh?

716
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,170
What's wrong with him?

717
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,930
It's dissociative amnesia.

718
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:54,190
It can be considered a mental shock, but it seems that some part of his brain has been completely deleted.

719
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:57,870
We have to give him time and wait.

720
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,370
We have to observe his progress for now.

721
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,490
Wha— What are you saying?

722
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,360
You want me to believe that?

723
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,760
You also saw that he is totally normal.

724
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,950
Huh?

725
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:13,220
Doctor, do it again, MRI or whatever!

726
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,620
Hey! They say it can happen temporarily if you have a traumatic head injury.

727
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,250
There is no way.

728
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,060
That shouldn't be it.

729
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,740
We can't catch them if Cheol Jin doesn't remember.

730
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,420
Yu Dong Man

731
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,160
384 Na 4178

732
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,010
I'm sending you the video analysis results.

733
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,590
384 Na 4178

734
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,490
384 Na 4178

735
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:10,630
384 Na 4178

736
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,600
384 Na 4178

737
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,750
4178. Oh!

738
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:17,980
Wait a moment. Wait a minute.

739
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,470
Wait a minute! Excuse me!

740
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,060
Professor.

741
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,410
- Excuse me.
- Professor!

742
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,890
Stop there.

743
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:26,460
Wait a minute. Hey!

744
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,110
Professor!

745
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,670
You stop there. Hey!

746
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,980
I told you to stop!

747
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,590
- Hey!
- Professor.

748
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,260
- Professor.
- Stop there!

749
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,360
It's a dark gray sedan.

750
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,430
The car becomes such a mess.

751
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:58,030
This is the last piece of advice I am giving pathetic you out of courtesy.

752
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:01,170
Leave this school quietly.

753
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,430
Wait a minute!

754
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:06,940
Hey! Hey! Ah!

755
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,840
What are you doing?

756
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,980
You asking me for my help,

757
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,320
is it still valid?

758
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,890
What, punk?

759
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,900
To catch those bastards,

760
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,750
you asked me to help you. Is it still valid?

761
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:42,090
I think I can protect the people who are hurt

762
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:46,600
and catch the bad guys.

763
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,400
The people... The people whom I have to protect,

764
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,400
can I find the method to

765
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,260
protect them properly as Police University student Kang Seon Ho working together

766
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:03,580
with you, Professor, instead of Hacker Yoon?

767
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:12,160
Police University

768
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:16,940
♫ Fly away towards tomorrow now, ♫

769
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:20,550
♫ fly away high to the end. ♫

770
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,850
♫ The hot sun is not in the sky. ♫

771
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:25,620
♫ I found it (I found it) ♫

772
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,580
♫ in my heart (in my heart) ♫

773
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:31,610
♫ Challenging ourselves every day, we're gonna burn it up. ♫

774
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:35,620
♫ There's nothing we can't get through together. ♫

775
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,620
♫ We're not stopping. ♫

776
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:40,270
Police University
♫ Never stop. Shout it out. ♫

777
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:43,250
These are the documents I found by following all the guys who engaged in illegal gambling.

778
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,610
I'll come back in a month.

779
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,900
These are the footprints of the culprit. Size 285.

780
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,240
But hands are faster than the eyes.

781
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,250
I saw it all.

782
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,810
From when did you see?
- From when you slipped it into your pocket.

783
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:58,120
You are like a mudfish. Let's go. I will definitely catch them.

784
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,860
What is that? You look like you've seen a puppy.

785
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,790
They say it's the end if they start looking cute.

786
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:05,550
Hey, don't smile so easily.

787
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:11,450
If a student engages in physical contact to demonstrate sex appeal, the student will be expelled.

788
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:14,400
Oh Kang Hui, you are expelled.
