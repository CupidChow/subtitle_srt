00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,650
Police University 
Episode 5

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,050
Stop right there! That punk...

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,300
Professor!

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,490
I told you to stop!

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,570
The ones that you are after, from the gambling site,

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,200
they're at National Police University—

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,750
Cheol Jin.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,710
It was pouring rain that night

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,730
so I don't know what it would have recorded.
- Thank you.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,450
It's a dark gray sedan. The license number

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,060
Isn't it 41?

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,550
- 4178
- The car becomes such a mess. An absolute mess.

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,010
This is the last piece of advice I'm giving pathetic you out of courtesy.

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,620
Get out of this school quietly.

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,270
Wait a minute!

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,790
Damn it.

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,960
What are you doing?

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,050
You asking me for my help,

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,370
is it still valid?

20
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,970
What, punk?

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,720
To catch those bastards, you asked me to help you.

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,640
Is it still valid?

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,990
Police University

24
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,050
If I'm next to you, Professor,

25
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,200
I think I can protect the people who are hurt

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,430
and catch the bad guys.

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,270
The people... The people whom I have to protect,

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,310
can I find the method to protect them properly

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,990
as Police University student Kang Seon Ho working together

30
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,010
with you, Professor, instead of Hacker Yoon?

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,390
You won't regret it?

32
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,720
What will happen in the future,

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,200
whom you'll come to meet,

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,770
I don't know what danger we'll encounter.

35
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,440
I might not even be able to protect you.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,780
Will it really be all right?

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,740
- Yes.
- Punk, why are you answering "yes" without even thinking?

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,500
I trust you.

39
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,470
Not you, Professor, but Bird Hyung.

40
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,680
That Hyung is a bit obnoxious but he doesn't do anything embarrassing.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,490
You sure know how to talk.

42
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,260
Then are we working together?

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,790
Well, for that then,

44
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,930
let's try it together!

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,240
- Then what should I start with?
- First, right now...

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,600
Yes?

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,740
- Go inside and sleep, Punk.
- What?

48
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,150
You punk, wandering around in the middle of the night...

49
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,000
If you have something to say, come do it during the day.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,210
Are you acting up like this without knowing this is all grounds for disciplinary action?

51
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,930
Yes, I'm sorry.

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,330
Then...

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,100
Hey, Kang Seon Ho.

54
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,830
Thanks.

55
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,240
One, two. One.

56
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,860
Everyone in their positions.

57
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,000
- Stop in place.
- One, two.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,410
- Everyone, stop!
- Yes!

59
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,140
Why is he running again?

60
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,470
- Wh-Wh-What are you doing?
- He's running.

61
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,990
Let's go eat.

62
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,030
Where are you going?

63
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,540
What is it? That face, like you've seen a puppy.

64
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,090
Who did? I did? When?

65
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,910
Just now.

66
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,970
While watching Kang Seon Ho.

67
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,330
What are you saying?

68
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,620
You're in big trouble.

69
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,030
They say it's game over if they look cute to you.

70
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,670
Hey, it's not like that. What is she saying?

71
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,440
What? They say that I'm going on dates every weekend?

72
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,170
You're not, right?

73
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:47,860
Are you crazy? I can still clearly hear the sound of his breathing.

74
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,580
Why is the sound of a dead person's breathing so clear?

75
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,120
Breathe the breath of a living person.

76
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,170
Oh, Professor Yu.

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,560
You're not hurt?

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,590
Look at that. I told you to come to the judo studio.

79
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,450
When we get to our age, our legs get weak.

80
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,670
I definitely was caught on something.

81
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,090
For men, our thighs are our lives.

82
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,290
Damn it.

83
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,430
The orientation is next week, right?

84
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,880
Yes. The marketing team is working on it.

85
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,330
The students will help with scheduling and all official documents.

86
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,110
Our judo club is going to put on a demonstration performance.

87
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,230
Oh, is that right? That's nice.

88
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,100
Professor Gwon, I hear your seminar on police function is this afternoon.

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,480
Yes, I'll have to leave by 1 p.m.

90
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,930
You'd better leave quickly if you're going all the way to Seoul. Should we finish the meeting now?

91
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,450
- Should we?
- You've worked hard.

92
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,690
Professor Yu still seems like a student when it comes to times like this.

93
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,010
They call that sort of thing not being able to act your age.

94
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,620
Why? It's cute.

95
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,670
Kang Hui.

96
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,670
Why did Min Jae Gyeong say such useless things...

97
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,410
Kang Hui.

98
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,470
Kang Hui.

99
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,700
Kang Hui.

100
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,440
Kang Hui.
Science of Investigation I

101
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,070
I'm crazy. Why are you like this Oh Kang Hui?

102
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,660
I must be crazy.

103
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,370
Kang Hui. Kang Hui. Kang Hui.

104
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,870
Hey!

105
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,660
You—

106
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,270
Don't you show you're teeth so easily.

107
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,150
My teeth?

108
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,410
Hey, I'm glad to run into you since we don't have time.

109
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,860
Follow me.

110
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,990
What is it?

111
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,430
Why do we have to check the black box in Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil's car?

112
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,940
There's no time.

113
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,510
I'll explain when we get back. Just hold him for 10 minutes

114
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,750
You're not trying to break onto his car, right? That's illeg—

115
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,640
What are you talking about "break into"?

116
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,670
I'm saying I'm going to look at the black box in the car.

117
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,790
So without the car owner's permission—

118
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,150
I'm going to tell him later. Later.

119
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,880
I'm going to look at the black box first.

120
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,680
- Still...
- Just what is the problem?

121
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,630
The door to a room is unlocked.

122
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,880
You opened the door and went inside. Is that a crime?

123
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,840
It's the crime of trespassing.

124
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,800
So while I was inside, I turned on the TV.

125
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,550
Is that a crime?

126
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,590
- To say watching the TV is a crime is a bit—
- See, it's the same thing!

127
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,500
But I think the car door will be locked.

128
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,380
Professor, I don't know very well yet about investigating,

129
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,110
but I think obstinately breaking the law while investigating is a bit wrong.

130
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,160
Isn't it most important to follow procedure as stipulated by the law while investigating?

131
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,050
- If that's difficult, accept help in the investigation.
- You're wrong.

132
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,080
What's most important when investigating is catching the criminal.

133
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,500
You were half right. You should follow the principles of the law,

134
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,480
but my investigative principle right now is only one.

135
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,270
Catching even one more criminal who stubbornly sets up and breaks the law

136
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,970
and throwing them in jail.

137
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,690
Still, this—

138
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,160
If you want to find further issues with this investigative method, speak after gaining more experience in the field.

139
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,470
There's no time. Are you going or not?

140
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,130
I don't know the right answer,

141
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,140
but I'll hope that your method is right, Professor.

142
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,800
- I'm going crazy here.
- Yes, this is Gwon Hyeok Pil.

143
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:14,240
If you want to keep criticizing my investigation methods, do it once you've been working out in the field a while.

144
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,290
Yes, I'm leaving now.

145
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,950
Yes, just ten minutes.

146
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,680
Professor.

147
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,970
I have something to ask you.

148
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,360
I can't answer you now so ask me later.

149
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm very, very curious about something.

150
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,330
I couldn't even sleep properly last night. Can't you give me a little bit of your time?

151
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,360
- What is it?
- What?

152
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,870
So that is...

153
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,660
Ah, I was reading a book related to constitutional law,

154
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,740
and I was wondering what a polygraph test was.

155
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,310
That wouldn't be constitutional law but criminal investigation.

156
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,850
Ah, right. It's criminal investigation.

157
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,940
So what I'm actually curious about is...

158
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,080
Article 329 of the Criminal Code,

159
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,670
says that the crime of theft is established by extorting other people's wealth against their will.

160
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,950
How is that different from the crime of embezzlement?

161
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,560
Lies.

162
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,200
Even if one's expression lies, the body cannot.

163
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Cognitive load that occurs when you speak.

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,190
- What is it?
- Pardon?

165
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,540
The movement of their eyes at that moment.

166
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,810
Touching one's nose when one is anxious.

167
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,260
They unknowingly make a fist to protect themselves.

168
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:03,240
Is wasting my time your specialty?

169
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,490
I-I'm sorry.

170
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,200
It should be open. No, it must be open.

171
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,660
Isn't it the most important to follow the procedure as stipulated by the law while investigating?

172
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,020
Ah, why did this jerk say all the right words?

173
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,080
I don't know! I don't know! I don't know!

174
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,350
Go in quickly before I change my mind.

175
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,940
I'll just close my eyes this once.

176
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,100
There's a chill in the air. I feel a dagger piercing my heart.

177
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,910
But don't worry.

178
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,990
Hands are faster than the eyes.

179
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,930
This car was your car?

180
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,800
I liked this car a lot so I was looking at it.

181
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,760
I saw it all.

182
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,090
- From when?
- From when you put it in.

183
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,270
Ah! Is that so?

184
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,530
Parking for professors

185
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,560
What are you doing? What are you, as a professor, doing with a student?

186
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,170
I know, right?

187
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,870
As a professor.

188
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,390
Anyway, where were you and what were you doing on March 2nd at 9 p.m.?

189
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,370
- What?
- I asked what you did last week on Tuesday night.

190
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,720
You drove past Jinseon-ro 39-gil.

191
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,420
There are no roads out there other than for freight trucks to park. Why were you there?

192
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,550
I don't think it's a hard question.

193
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,390
This seems like an investigation, not asking questions.

194
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,110
It would be nice if you would just answer what I asked you.

195
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,770
Why should I answer a question that's out of line?

196
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,120
Oh! The right to remain silent?

197
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,860
Okay.

198
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,160
Student Kang Seon Ho, what are you looking at? Go inside.

199
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,860
Yes, sorry.

200
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,880
I will talk to you after I'm back from the seminar.

201
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,300
Why? Are you going to run away like yesterday?

202
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,360
What?

203
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,470
I called you but you ran away.

204
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,320
Don't cross the line.

205
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,360
I already crossed it.

206
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,670
This guy! I tried to be patient!

207
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,330
Hey!

208
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,460
What are you doing? You call yourselves professors?

209
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,300
A student is watching, but you're shouting at each other?

210
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,760
Are you crazy? Are you really crazy?

211
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,120
- It's just that—
- This person...

212
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,230
Dammit.

213
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,500
I also have a temper but I control it because we are at school.

214
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,780
Or shall I also show you my temper?

215
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,730
Where are you going? We still haven't finished talking—

216
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,490
If you have something left to say, do it off-campus.

217
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,230
You can't let fighting be all that a student learns from you.

218
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,440
Ah, that startled me! That jerk!

219
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,510
Oh!

220
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:34,130
Hey! Does that bastard want to die?

221
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,190
Oh!

222
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,350
You can't do that one thing properly, punk?

223
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,480
You should have held onto the hem of his pants

224
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,520
or tripped him up! You should have done something!

225
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,640
You don't even know the basics for investigation.

226
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,360
That's right, I don't know.

227
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,730
I started school last week, and investigation classes all got canceled this week.

228
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,010
There was no time for me to learn the basics of investigation.

229
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,120
This punk, saying whatever he wants! What? You had no time to learn?

230
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,320
Hey, how can you say that as a Police University student?

231
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,330
Before speaking so bluntly to me,

232
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,100
study investigation first.

233
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,300
Huh, seriously!

234
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,860
Yeah, what?

235
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,360
Seoul Metropolitan Police Station

236
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,000
Hey, Punk! What do you think you're doing?

237
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,640
You ordered Sergeant Ju to get a prosecutor to issue a warrant?

238
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,380
This bastard! Have you gone nuts?!

239
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,790
What choice did I have?

240
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,030
We need to at least get a warrant to search Cheol Jin's phone records!

241
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,540
Exactly. Why would you do that?!

242
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,110
I understand how you feel,

243
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,460
but you're not on this team anymore and have no investigation rights! How many times do I have to tell you that?

244
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,700
Exactly! If you understand how I feel, let's catch them.

245
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,590
Let's catch those bastards.

246
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,300
Fine. By doing whatever you want,

247
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,830
will you only stop when Sergeant Ju gets hurt, too?

248
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,690
Do you think you're the only sunbae (mentor) to Cheol Jin and Eun Ju?

249
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,230
I get why you're acting up without thinking things through,

250
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:26,000
but if you keep putting my team members in awkward situations, I can't just stand by and watch.

251
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,830
For doing things haphazardly, I apologize.

252
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,140
Do you think you're the only sunbae to Cheol Jin and Eun Ju?

253
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:08,530
Kim Eun Ju
Police

254
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,900
Oh! Where are you going?

255
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,730
We got the IP address for the illegal gambling ring, so we're going out to investigate.

256
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,840
But why are you going?

257
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,830
Since they got on my radar from the start.

258
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,640
But it's dangerous.

259
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,210
Don't worry. I won't die before my wedding.

260
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,990
Oh, did you give the wedding invitation to Team Leader Choi?

261
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,380
Not yet. I'm going to give it to him at the group dinner tomorrow.

262
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,200
I see. Team Leader Choi will probably be shocked.

263
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,100
He will be shocked!

264
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,290
When he sees the name of the groom.

265
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,650
- Eun Ju!
- Hey, hold on.

266
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,320
Eun Ju!

267
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,270
Mentor.

268
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,760
- Mentor.
- Please calm down.

269
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,730
Eun Ju!!

270
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,270
Eun Ju!

271
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,840
Let me go!

272
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,410
Eun Ju!

273
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,800
Professor Yu Dong Man

274
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,690
Wedding Day

275
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,800
Yun Seok Dae and Bang Yong Sun's Eldest Son Yun Dong Man

276
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,290
Kim Do Ui and Hong Yun Hui's eldest daughter Kim Eun Ju

277
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,990
Hey. I told you to fall from shoulder to back.

278
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,040
Is Seon Ho here yet?

279
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,440
I heard the promotions unit and the student council have to get their movements coordinated.

280
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,070
I couldn't relay the message because he left his phone in the barracks.

281
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,000
Me! I'll go look for him.

282
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Again.

283
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,040
Yes, yes. You are right.

284
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,920
Of course, the students should learn on their own.

285
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,700
Investigation

286
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,420
Even so,

287
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,080
what did I do so wrong?

288
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,970
Got you.

289
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,130
Then shouldn't we go to the gym right now, Sunbae?

290
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,740
It's okay.

291
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,650
It's a demonstration for the college entrance information session, and anyway I'm going to practice tomorrow, as well.

292
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,150
But you are going to read all these books?

293
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,080
Are you a freshman or what?

294
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,220
I should study.

295
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,130
But, Sunbae.

296
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,740
Is there a way to obtain blackboxes

297
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,680
as legal evidence?

298
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,220
You would need a warrant, of course.

299
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,820
How about something faster?

300
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,860
Assisting in the investigation?

301
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,970
But you are already learning how to collect evidence as a freshman?

302
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,700
I thought I'd prepare.

303
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,340
You're so good.

304
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,490
Then, should I, who got all A's in investigation classes,

305
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,430
- teach you something?
- You got all A's?
- Yes.

306
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,880
Awesome!

307
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,810
For real?

308
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,180
- How did you do it?
- Want to know?

309
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,070
I really, really am not good at studying.

310
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,810
Oh, I see.

311
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,410
If you teach me, I'd buy a yummy meal.

312
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,970
For sure I told him not to show his teeth.

313
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,890
If you ask, I will.

314
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,750
If you are going to teach me, I'll do my best to learn.

315
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,660
Then call me Noona instead of Sunbae.

316
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,390
Sunbaenim! Hello.

317
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,090
May I take Kang Seon Ho?

318
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,760
I need to talk to him about the orientation.

319
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,080
You should've called.

320
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,460
I'd come over right away.

321
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,310
Forget it. Now that I think about it, it wasn't that important.

322
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,270
About that investigation,

323
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,530
why not do the image training before you hit the books?

324
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,630
You can be the culprit and the victim.

325
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,410
Use your brain before learning from someone else.

326
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,380
Is your head for looks only?

327
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,320
What? You don't have time to learn?

328
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,530
Is that something a police academy student should say?

329
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,890
Use your brain before learning from someone else.

330
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,900
Is your head for looks only?

331
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,410
I mean, what the hell is going on with Professor Gwon Hyeon Pil?

332
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,750
Professor Yu Dong Man: If you aren't sleeping, then come over here.

333
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,470
If not sleeping, come on over.

334
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,650
You should come over if you need me.

335
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,390
Why should I?

336
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,340
- What's keeping you up?
- What was keeping you busy and kept you from eating?

337
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,640
I asked first.

338
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,020
The blackbox,

339
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,050
I was looking for a way to

340
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,580
- obtain it legally.
- And?

341
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,600
- First, we ask for a warrant—
- What if it gets denied?

342
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,680
Then...

343
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,600
get access to the data with consent—

344
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,130
What if the suspect can destroy it?

345
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,520
- The suspect?
- On the day of Cheol Jin's incident,

346
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,620
at the same time and on the same road,

347
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,490
a car was following him.

348
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,670
It was Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil's car.

349
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,600
That's why I wanted to see his blackbox.

350
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,430
But it could've been a coincidence that he was on that road.

351
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,280
Since it's by the school.

352
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,850
How would you know if it's a coincidence or if it was designed to look like a coincidence?

353
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,280
Investigation is something where you have to consider all possibilities

354
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,540
because we never know when or where a variable will pop out

355
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,480
and surprise us.

356
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,360
This is the information I gathered chasing the illegal gambling organization.

357
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,390
Each page contains the blood and sweat of the detectives,

358
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,260
and countless sleepless nights.

359
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,740
- I will be back in one month.
- Sit down, you punk.

360
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,000
I will explain it to you briefly, so listen carefully.

361
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,380
The cyber investigation team

362
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,720
detected that illegal gambling sites were created and were using cryptocurrency.

363
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,200
Afterward, through a joint investigation, our team found out

364
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,010
that this illegal gambling site

365
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,290
was being operated extensively both online and offline.

366
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,230
So, Cheol Jin and I,

367
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,020
started to do the legwork.

368
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,310
Legwork

369
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,680
"Legwork" refers to an investigative technique to collect information

370
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,520
necessary to solve a crime.

371
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,230
In addition to this, an investigation to discern the criminal's motive

372
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,230
and the location of the crime.

373
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,690
There are existing conventional methods including modus operandi investigation (M.O.).

374
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,180
There are also stolen goods investigations, identification investigations,

375
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,780
telecommunication investigations, and alibi investigations.

376
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,520
Let me give you an example.

377
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,420
What if the police heard information

378
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,870
that an illegal gambling site

379
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,790
was operating in cryptocurrency?

380
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,610
The police will start an investigation internally.

381
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,820
That's right. During the investigation,

382
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,650
the police, aware that the gambling site

383
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,880
also ran a private gambling house,

384
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,280
moved to capture the person who really manages that gambling group.

385
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,770
- This is?
- "Legwork" investigation.

386
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,750
Okay. And then,

387
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,720
they found out that the gambling house uses

388
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,100
game terminals that they created.

389
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,650
What if we attach a location tracker chip

390
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,400
to that game terminal,

391
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,970
and attack them when it's taken to the home base?

392
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,680
It maybe ....

393
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,240
- M.O. investigation?
- Maybe?

394
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,730
- Maybe?
- It is an M.O. investigation!

395
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,730
- Speak quietly, you punk. Quietly.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,720
But the device tracking failed due to an unexpected accident.

397
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,030
Instead,

398
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,190
we had secured a program

399
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,490
to track the main accounts of the cryptocurrency.

400
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,170
When they cashed in the coins,

401
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,250
all we had to do was track the flow of transactions, but –

402
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,290
But then I came in and hacked into it.

403
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,310
That's right!

404
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,210
I'm sorry.

405
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,530
Anyway, at that time,

406
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,390
they moved their main accounts,

407
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,290
the site was taken down, and Cheol Jin got hurt.

408
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,760
The investigation is back to square one.

409
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,530
But why did you think the criminal who attacked Ahjussi Cheol Jin

410
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,390
was in on the gambling site?

411
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,670
The ones that you are after, from the gambling site,

412
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,950
they're at the National Police University—

413
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,870
Hey— Cheol Jin.

414
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,900
It's a detective's intuition, you punk.

415
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:26,570
But can we really catch them?

416
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,000
Listen to me carefully.

417
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,710
No matter how good a detective is,

418
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,240
he can't control every situation and cannot predict coincidences.

419
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,500
Therefore for each case, it can take as little as a few months

420
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
or as long as several decades.

421
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,480
In the process, a police officer ...

422
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,070
Unfortunately, a police officer can be killed,

423
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,190
and the perpetrators can commit other crimes.

424
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,140
The police investigation fee for large cities

425
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,110
is 30,000 won per month. The investigation budget for a case is only 180,000 won.

426
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,300
This means the police don't have enough money to investigate,

427
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:14,200
and ridiculously we end up losing the suspects.

428
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,390
Nevertheless,

429
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,870
if our police don't give up,

430
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,710
if only we don't give up,

431
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,370
justice will surely come.

432
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,630
So, let's never give up

433
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,390
on any case.

434
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,120
Do you understand?

435
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,130
Yes, sir!

436
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,940
- What's wrong? What? What?
- What about Seon Ho?

437
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,450
You scared me. He said to go ahead first.

438
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,840
Okay.

439
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,100
Excuse me, Professor. I gave it some thought.

440
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,250
How about we create a minor fender-bender first, then we can check the black box?

441
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,530
This isn't illegal.

442
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,610
- I'm sorry.
- No.

443
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,340
What you're saying is right.

444
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,740
Because that is more of an undercover investigation.

445
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,540
- Right?
- The end justifies the means.

446
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,200
Let's go.

447
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,640
What brings you here?

448
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,560
The thing you wanted to get your hands on by putting on a show in the parking lot.

449
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,200
It seems like it was a misunderstanding.

450
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,670
There's a program that checks if the video has been manipulated or not, right?

451
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,680
Go check it out.

452
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,790
Where are you going?

453
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,630
Oh, Team Leader.

454
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,670
Oh, that's right. The book.

455
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,800
You're not being looked down on or anything,

456
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,450
because you didn't graduate from here, are you?

457
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,070
What are you saying? I'm Yu Dong Man.

458
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,510
Is Yu Dong Man's heart made of steel?

459
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,500
I know you get hurt by words, just like I do.

460
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,700
Seriously? What's wrong with you?

461
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,710
Are you sick?

462
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,570
I knew

463
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,090
that you and Eun Ju were planning on getting married.

464
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,130
But I thought I had to pretend I didn't know, so that you could move on.

465
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,730
So, I pretended to not know until right now.

466
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,870
If you're going to say things like that, then go. I don't want to hear it.

467
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,010
While chasing those criminal gamblers,

468
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,150
yes, Eun Ju died.

469
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,680
But that was an accident, you punk.

470
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:28,010
Dong Man, let's not make Eun Ju's death into a sad soap opera.

471
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,060
That's right, Eun Ju was in an accident two years ago.

472
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,150
But this time, Cheol Jin's incident isn't an accident.

473
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,740
But Team Leader,

474
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,060
just like you pretended to not know about Eun Ju and me all this time,

475
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,490
turn a blind eye just a little longer.

476
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,390
I have to catch those bastards,

477
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,580
so I can finish what Eun Ju started.

478
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,870
Please help me out.

479
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,710
You crazy jerk.

480
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,200
It's Cheol Jin's cell phone records.

481
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,410
There wasn't much. There was one strange number that came up,

482
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,390
but it was a burner phone.

483
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,670
If you go around digging for no reason and end up hurt like Cheol Jin,

484
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,750
I really won't let it go.

485
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,860
You really don't listen to me.

486
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,300
You punk, are you not even going to get me a coffee?

487
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,020
Illegal gambling, Police death case

488
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,590
Sergeant Kim Eun Ju died in a car accident while investigating illegal gambling sites.

489
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,700
The late Kim Eun Ju, who died in this accident, has worked at the Cyber Investigation Division of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency since February 2017.

490
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,290
How are you feeling?

491
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,910
I'm raring to go, of course. I'm dying to leave. It's killing me.

492
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,620
After hearing your voice, you sound like you're all better.

493
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,900
How come your voice sounds like you're dying?

494
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,780
Hang up, you punk.

495
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,960
It should rain.

496
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,370
The weather is too nice.

497
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,890
Professor.

498
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,980
Yes?

499
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,550
There wasn't anything unusual with the blackbox footage and the time wasn't manipulated either.

500
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,860
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

501
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,620
- All right.
- Professor.

502
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,490
Let's go together.

503
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,250
- Where?
- Aren't you going to the fishing spot?

504
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:53,810
We can watch the CCTV footage together, listen to the witness testimonies, and check the scene.

505
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,580
Are you not going to do roll call? I'm just going to go alone —

506
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,520
No. Let's go together.

507
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,980
You said that during an investigation you never know when or where a variable might pop out

508
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,460
and catch us by surprise.

509
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,260
But if there were two of us, wouldn't it be better?

510
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,720
Here, ma'am.

511
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,450
What is that?

512
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,350
Going out pass
Student: Kang Seon Ho, Reason: Personal reason, Approving Professor: Yu Dong Man, [signed] Yu

513
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,160
This ... look at this ...

514
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,830
Gwon Hyeok Pil

515
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,260
That's right, it's Professor Gwon.

516
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,870
He probably comes about three days a week.

517
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,430
Would it kill him not to go fishing so often?

518
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,130
It's not that.

519
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,610
People who come fishing that often usually have stories about losing money

520
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,260
or being heartbroken.

521
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,690
Since he comes often, he sometimes gives them legal advice.

522
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,120
That's filming right now, right?

523
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,760
Of course, it is.

524
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,490
For now, Professor Gwon's alibi checks out.

525
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,240
Cheol Jin and I got disconnected at 21:14. (9:14 pm)

526
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,530
21:06:04 (9:06:04 pm)

527
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,370
Sir, the road on the way in here,

528
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:36,690
is there another footpath besides the car road?

529
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,700
It's exactly 1300 meters from here to the crime scene.

530
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:47,550
If we get there in eight minutes, Professor Gwon's alibi won't be credible.

531
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,230
By the way, can I ask why you need to go this far

532
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,540
to check him out?

533
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,210
I mean, because he was on the same road at the same time,

534
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,730
I don't think there is enough reasonable doubt.

535
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,460
These are the criminal's footprints that were left at Cheol Jin's crime scene.

536
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,850
Because it rained that day I couldn't get it as evidence,

537
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,740
but I could guess the size—285.

538
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,550
The feet are quite big.

539
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,950
Is Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil's ... ?

540
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,380
285

541
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,230
Yes, it's 285.

542
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,440
Reasonable doubt, do you need more?

543
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,130
Let's go.

544
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,450
If he doesn't follow the procedure and takes a student out, it's a problem.

545
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:19,080
Yes, you're right. Our Professor Yu seems to be very talented

546
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,720
at making trouble.

547
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,650
Professor!

548
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,290
My goodness, you scared me.

549
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,800
Let's see.

550
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,470
A student and professor, where could they have gone in the middle of the night?

551
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:41,990
Somehow I feel like it's about romance.

552
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,510
- How many minutes?
- Eight minutes and five seconds.

553
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,130
See! We just have to go a little faster and it's possible.

554
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,190
That's right. I was right.

555
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,200
There is a possibility that he deliberately revealed himself on CCTV in advance

556
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,790
and moved on foot!

557
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:27,200
That sly bastard. I will catch him no matter what.

558
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,700
Professor.

559
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,000
If it is found that the suspect is unable to reach the crime scene in that given time,

560
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,750
the charges will disappear because they have an established alibi, right?

561
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,100
That's true,

562
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,100
but it's a fake alibi, not an established alibi.

563
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,220
What is it, you punk?

564
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,910
The rain.

565
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,320
- What?
- You said it rained on the day of the incident.

566
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,130
That day, it rained 15mm per hour.

567
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,240
The stone bridge we passed by seems to become submerged when it rains.

568
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,790
Well, no matter how you got across the submerged bridge,

569
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,420
you probably wouldn't have made it here in eight minutes.

570
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,470
You taught me that if the suspect has an alibi established,

571
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,710
they must be excluded from the list of suspects to be identified as a culprit.

572
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,770
So ...

573
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:34,850
Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil should be excluded from the list of suspects.

574
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:42,590
I think it's a relief to hear that

575
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,140
a professor from the National Police University isn't the criminal.

576
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,810
Am I pathetic?

577
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:15,540
Because I, the professor, missed something that you caught as a student?

578
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:19,570
No. I didn't know

579
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:24,310
that chasing someone, catching someone

580
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,950
is really difficult.

581
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:32,720
Emotions and reason play separately, so why would there be students and professors?

582
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,580
Then what's there?

583
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:42,680
It's just ... people.

584
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,230
For someone who doesn't even know how to investigate, talking about the law and the principle,

585
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,660
I'm sorry for saying things like that.

586
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,800
From now on, keep doing that.

587
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,560
Excuse me?

588
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,480
When I'm running blindly,

589
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,250
shouldn't you grab the brakes?

590
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,760
Do you think I'm always right?

591
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,690
I also can be wrong and make mistakes.

592
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,840
Like you said, I'm also a human being, you punk.

593
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,390
That's why a cop needs a partner,

594
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,860
and two is probably better than one.

595
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:44,750
Anyway, you just got lucky today,

596
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,760
so don't get full of yourself and act up. Got it?

597
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,580
Yes, sir.

598
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,500
Then, Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil is clear now, right?

599
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,260
What do you mean clear?

600
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,010
It's just that he's less likely to be the criminal.

601
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,680
- Professor.
- So

602
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,100
now I'm going to go ask him myself.

603
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:10,130
If he's really not it, then I will really apologize.

604
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:20,120
You punk, just think about investigating this from now on.

605
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,540
This is Cheol Jin's phone records.

606
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,710
Call History

607
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:29,310
As for the explanation, it will be after I come back from the bathroom.

608
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,190
Our professor must be really drunk.

609
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:40,730
Oh my! Oh my! Give it to me!

610
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,290
Ah, geez!

611
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,550
Just give it to me.

612
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,660
Geez, I just did that because I was sorry.

613
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,750
Yes, would you have done that on purpose?

614
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,590
Don't tell me ...

615
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,760
You didn't do that on purpose, did you?

616
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,220
Geez, my hand just slipped.

617
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,710
Was that an important document?

618
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,860
What should I do? Oh, the hair dryer!

619
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,860
I will bring a hair dryer out right away. Just wait a moment.

620
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,690
I can just print this out again, Owner!

621
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,980
National Police University

622
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,540
Then, the students attending the entrance exam presentation will be led by the student council first.

623
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,330
Okay.

624
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,610
- Oh, right! It's Cheongram Sports Festival soon, right?
- Yes.

625
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,570
Oh, I heard the team that wins the Cheongram Sports Festival will get a special leave.

626
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:53,950
Really? That's awesome.

627
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,180
Speaking of which, Kang Hui,

628
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,690
if you're okay with it, on the first day out, do you want to go with m—

629
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,820
Kang Hui! I'm sorry I'm late.

630
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,580
The book was due today, so I had to stop by the library.

631
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,420
Hey, since you're already late, you should have just walked. Why would you run?

632
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,100
- Drink this.
- Thanks.

633
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,030
Thank you.

634
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,190
Let me ask you one last question.

635
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,890
Did you really ... go fishing that day?

636
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,610
Were you really there the whole time?

637
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,180
Look here, Professor Yu.

638
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,510
I'm doing this because I also don't want to suspect you anymore.

639
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:40,320
Please answer me.

640
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,840
I was there the whole time. Is that good enough?

641
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,620
Then, at that time, did you see anyone on the road or—

642
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,650
I did see someone.

643
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,850
On the way to the fishing spot,

644
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:58,130
I saw someone throwing up on the side of the road.

645
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,290
He also stumbled as if he had been drinking.

646
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,480
- Why are you just now telling me about this—
- So,

647
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,030
shouldn't you have asked me about it first?

648
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,560
Before you tried to break into my car?

649
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:22,040
A hoobae police officer was attacked by an unidentified person near the school.

650
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,170
I thought anyone could have been the suspect,

651
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:29,220
and so I made a mistake about you, Professor Gwon.

652
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,320
I'm sorry. I was rude and crossed the line.

653
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,240
This won't happen again.

654
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,660
Is that all?

655
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,510
I'll accept your apology, but I'm still in a bad mood.

656
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,340
Let's do one round, and let it all go.

657
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,950
All right, I'm fine with that,

658
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,330
but your lower body looks really weak.

659
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,100
Do you fight with your mouth? Let's start.

660
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,800
It's a one round fight.

661
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,900
Ready, go!

662
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:25,650
Ah, my fingernails.

663
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,700
What happened? Are you all right?

664
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,890
The more I look at him, the cuter he gets.

665
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,170
- Hey, watch your feet. Your feet.
- Okay.

666
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,460
Are you done cleaning?

667
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,120
Yes, sir! We are almost done.

668
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,600
There's a rumor that students are wandering around after roll call,

669
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,990
and if they get caught it they'll get 30 penalty points. You know that, right?

670
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:12,170
If you go in and out of the opposite sex's dormitory for personal reasons,

671
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:16,300
you will be severely punished, so take extra caution.

672
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,120
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

673
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,730
I feel like I got wrinkles from the last few days of stress.

674
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,880
It's today, right?

675
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,510
Yes.

676
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:55,080
National Police University

677
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,300
Alright, are you all excited to be at the National Police University today?
2022 School Year National Police University Admissions Information Session
Q & A

678
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,790
I'm Kang Myeong Jung, a second-year student. It's nice to meet you.

679
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,950
Having good grades to get in is important,

680
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,830
but a strong sense of duty is just as important.

681
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:12,220
The police emblem you see here, shows an eagle soaring while holding a hibiscus.

682
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,720
Only then can you become a police officer.

683
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,390
You should all give it a try.

684
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,130
You will be expelled if you engage in an inappropriate relationship.

685
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:23,620
For the nation, justice, and our honor. That's our National Police University motto.

686
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,620
To my left, you can see the Coexistence Tower.

688
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:37,220

Professor!

699
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:15,330
Hey Jun Wuk! Professor is speaking.

700
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:19,370
The student council, judo team, promotions unit, you all worked hard.

701
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:22,940
But is the professor in charge of the promotions unit not here?

702
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,480
Oh! He's here.

703
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,630
I don't want to!

704
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:38,900
So, why did you leave your seat when we were choosing the club professor?

705
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,640
Please promote the National Police University well.

706
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,340
Um-chi-chi, um-chi-chi. Um-chi-chi, um-chi-chi.

707
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,490
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

708
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:50,610
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

709
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,700
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

710
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,740
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

711
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,530
Bunny, bunny. Bunny, bunny.

712
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,380
Han Min Guk

713
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,220
- I'm sorry.
- One shot!

714
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
One shot, one shot!

715
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,620
Nice.

716
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:11,210
I ... I ... I'm going to go to the bathroom.

717
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:17,180
The student council can't keep up with our judo club.

718
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,640
Exactly. The professor in charge himself can't keep up.

719
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,580
Get a hold of yourselves.

720
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,950
You are acting like professors with no shame.

721
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,410
- What's this? What's this? What's this? Drink up. Drink up.
- Thank you.

722
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,160
- Oh, wait a minute! I'll drink it for him.
- What's this?!

723
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,310
- Wow. A black rose!
- She's drinking it for him. What's going on?

724
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,370
Drink it for me.

725
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,840
Won't you pull yourself together?

726
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:40,910
♫ Tell me your wish ♫

727
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,550
Since I was a black rose (drank a penalty drink for him), I will tell you my wish.

728
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,650
Just tell me. I will grant you all of your wishes.

729
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,490
Then, practice judo with me every night.

730
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,690
Every night?! Oh ... wow ...

731
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,690
Shoes! (sounds similar to f*ck)

732
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,760
Why do you keep stepping on my shoes?! My feet are hurting like crazy!

733
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,530
Hey! You follow me!

734
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,820
Gossi Beer

735
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,030
What the hell are you doing?

736
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,830
Are you out of your mind or what?

737
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:18,850
I'm sorry. My feet hurt a lot.

738
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,730
But I'm really dizzy.

739
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,340
Hey, you only had three drinks!

740
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,130
Why don't you sober up?!

741
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:28,140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

742
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:33,670
Hey! Hey, Kang Seon Ho!

743
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,230
How old are you?

744
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,710
I was born in 1980.

745
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,600
Why do you want to know that?

746
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,370
Oh! We're the same age!

747
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:48,570
All three of us are born in 1980! Let's be friends. Let's be friends.

748
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:49,540
Hyeok Pil.

749
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,420
I have a lot of friends. I don't need more.

750
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,490
Then, the two of us will just be friends. Just the two of us.

751
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:59,270
This is a public place. Let's stop eating and leave now.

752
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:03,650
Come on, this is on the house, eat it before you go.

753
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:07,580
It's ttongjip (gizzards)! As expected, you're quick, Professor Go.

754
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,860
Professor? You are a Professor?

755
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:16,190
I taught her how to use a knife in real-life situations,

756
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:20,080
and from then on she called me Professor Go.

757
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,880
Real-life situations?

758
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,960
I have two stars.

759
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,310
I have two previous convictions.

760
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,170
It's been over ten years since I've wiped my hands clean from crime.

761
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:33,490
It's not like I am running a bar in front of the National Police University to commit crimes.

762
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,760
This bar owner, he's a funny guy.

763
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:47,030
But are there any other bars around here?

764
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:51,430
There are some, but his is the best one.

765
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:54,610
Should I call it the guest room of the National Police University?

766
00:54:54,610 --> 00:55:00,410
Bar owner, the guy that came here with me, the guy whose body is nice and his voice is like this,

767
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,060
Mentor, Mentor.

768
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,980
That guy, that detective, you know him, right?

769
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,720
I know him. He's the detective with the broad shoulders, isn't he?

770
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,900
Did he also drink here last Tuesday?

771
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,800
Tuesday?

772
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,850
Did he?

773
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,360
I can't even remember what happened yesterday.

774
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,980
I guess not. I mean, I don't either.

775
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,430
Yes, I guess so.

776
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:29,760
But are there any CCTVs here?

777
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,320
Since it's a business, you probably do, right?

778
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,010
- I'm cold, Kang Hui.
- Hey, be quiet.

779
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,590
Why isn't he answering his phone?

780
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,900
- Beom Tae.
- I'm cold. I'm really cold.

781
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,710
You're heavy. What do I do?

782
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,150
Kang Hui

783
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,320
Hey, hey, hey. Should I really not answer it?

784
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,990
You punk!

785
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:56,970
It's loyalty and friendship not to answer.

786
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,890
I know this best. But what time is it now?

787
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,150
It's 1 a.m.

788
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,770
What?! If they get caught outside ...

789
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,840
They'll get severely punished! Ah!

790
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,320
I can't walk.

791
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,410
Hey! Hey! Get up!

792
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:14,160
Hey!

793
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,600
National Police University

794
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,120
Hey! You need to walk quietly now.

795
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,120
If we get caught, we're going to get severely punished.

796
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,070
I caught you, you rats.

797
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:13,490
These rats are fun, aren't they?

798
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:23,080
- Rats!
- What's going on?

799
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,330
What is this?

800
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,040
Ah, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

801
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,860
Do you know that?

802
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,490
What is this?

803
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,730
I caught you, you rats.

804
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,290
I need to get rid of all these stairs. Woo-hoo!

805
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:52,650
Please.

806
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,180
Kang Hui—

807
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,080
Be quiet.

808
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,600
God!

809
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,690
Where did they go?

810
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,460
Conduct within the dormitory.

811
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,680

00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:39,280
and cannot go beyond the moral limits!

816
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,050
I can't breathe.

817
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,190
Be quiet!

818
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,070

he or she will be

821
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,730
expelled from school immediately! Expelled from school immediately.

822
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:58,190
Expelled from school immediately!

823
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,410
Expelled?

824
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,920
What should I do?

825
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,890
Oh Kang Hui ... !

826
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:05,150
Be quiet.

827
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,570
Oh Kang Hui!

828
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,080
Oh Kang Hui!

829
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,360
Oh ... Kang ... Hui!

830
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,640
Oh Kang Hui! Oh Kang Hui!

831
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,260

834
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:22,520
- Expelled! You are expelled!
- Oh ....

835
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,800
- Oh Kang Hui, you are expelled!
- Oh ...

836
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:42,490
♫ Truly, I wanna know, I wanna know what's on my mind ♫

837
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:47,370
♫ What is this feeling that I'm feeling all at once? ♫

838
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:50,050
♫ My heart keeps pounding, ♫

839
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,560
♫ you're dazzling like a shining star ♫

840
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:58,080
♫ When I see you, I'm filled with thoughts of you ♫

841
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:03,260

842
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,660
♫ We are going to dream the same dream again. Can you feel it? ♫

01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:37,020

♫ Well, if you want to know ♫

854
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,900
Police University
♫ Get Ready ♫

855
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,810
If it's her mom's trial, Kang Hui would definitely want to go.

856
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,800
You said that if you win the Cheongram Sports Festival, you'll get a special leave, right?

857
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,540
Who the hell are you?

858
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,480
I'll do anything you want, so let's do the Cheongram Sports Festival first.

859
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,800
What did you do to Kang Hui?

860
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,880
What will happen if a man and a woman are trapped in a warehouse.

861
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,350
What are you imagining, you jerk?!

862
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,220
You lunatic!

863
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,930
Of course, I should take responsibility.

864
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,310
I'm going to get the special leave and give it to Kang Hui.

865
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:14,430
If he's the suspect, he will definitely show up at the Cheongram Sports Festival.

866
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,720
I caught you. I caught you, punk!

867
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,790
♫ The place you and I are going to look toward is the same ♫

868
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,999
♫ Can you feel it? That's what I ♫
