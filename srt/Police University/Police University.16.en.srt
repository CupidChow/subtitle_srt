1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,510
Final Episode

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,660
Son!

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,070
Father.

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,420
In addition to this site, more than three hundred have been confirmed so far.

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,150
They all have the same logo, and the sites are all messed up.

6
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,360
I think a hacker did it.

7
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,690
Sunbae, are you listening?

8
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,690
- What time did it first occur?
- What?

9
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,470
When did the hacking attack start?

10
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,010
According to the cyber investigation team, it was around midnight last night.

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,960
"Introduction to Administrative Law"

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,300
"Introduction to Administrative Law"

13
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,880
Professor. Even if Professor Seo Sang Hak was wrong,

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,500
what the Zelkova Tree Support Association wanted to achieve

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,900
wasn't wrong, was it?

16
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,400
It seems that the saplings of the National Police University were zelkova trees.

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,680
I think he started it because he just wanted to protect the school.

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,820
His method was wrong,

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,400
even though the intention was right.

20
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,640
The method was wrong.

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,130
Even though the intention was right.

22
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,550
I'm sorry. I'm going to make one last mistake.

23
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,740
The foolish student who learned from his foolish professor.

24
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,160
This jerk...seriously.

25
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,930
He called me a foolish professor.

26
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,020
This makes me upset.

27
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,320
♫ Fly away ♫

28
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,770
♫ Facing tomorrow now ♫

29
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,770
An unprecedented hacking incident has occurred.

30
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,920
The target is over one thousand illegal gambling sites with servers in Korea,

31
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,430
and the moment you access the illegal gambling site, the screen freezes

32
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,070
with a tree logo.

33
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,870
This is the so-called "deface hacking" method that modifies

34
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,790
the screen appearance of a website.

35
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,750
Unlike other hackers who use this "deface" method to show off their abilities or

36
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,910
- to deliver political messages,
- That's how

37
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,180
- it was found that no messages other than the logo
- the Zelkova Tree Support Association is revealed to the world.

38
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,260
were found in this hacking attack.

39
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,520
Meanwhile, the majority of illegal gambling sites operating in Korea have been shut down

40
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,860
due to this hacking attack that lasted for a week.

41
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,940
An average of more than 100 sites per day have been closed.

42
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,580
As a result, the police announced

43
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,030
that they would carry out another large-scale special crackdown,

44
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,320
not only on closed sites but would also follow up on last year's online gambling sites.

45
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,500
Attention is focused on whether a small ball

46
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,140
launched by an anonymous hacker

47
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,070
can be the starting point of a successful investigation

48
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,170
into an illegal gambling site.

49
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,960
This is Im Hyeon Seok from KCS.

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,320
Is he Hong Gil Dong or what?

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,400
There are so many crazy people in the world.

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,880
I don't know who it is, but thanks to them, the illegal gambling site operators

53
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,040
- are upset.
- You're right.

54
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,920
Let's go. I heard there's a request for support.

55
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,650
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,660
Trustworthy police for a safe country.

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,830
Deposit 5,000,000 won / 7,000,000 won

58
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,580
Go to college!

59
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,990
Confessions alone can't prove you are guilty,

60
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,770
so there will probably be an investigation into the case you hacked at that time.

61
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,020
I understand.

62
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,660
If you had only pretended not to know about it, probably no one would have found out.

63
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,610
Didn't you consider that?

64
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,860
That's why I came.

65
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,600
It can't be made into something that never happened.

66
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,870
Team Leader.

67
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,500
- Are you going to class?
- My goodness...

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,300
Where the hell are you hiding when you pop out of nowhere?

69
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,460
All over the place.

70
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,700
About that illegal gambling site, that was Seon Ho, right?

71
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,710
Didn't you see the news?

72
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,670
They say it was an anonymous hacker.

73
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,040
It was just like Yu Dong Man Junior.

74
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,300
You must be lonely because Seon Ho left.

75
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,960
Lonely? Wh-Who said I was lonely? Who?

76
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,380
What you will learn in this class are

77
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,290
the crime victim protection measures and the victim rescue system.

78
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,600
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

79
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,900
I'm going to take notes here and give them to Seon Ho.

80
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,460
That's going to take forever.

81
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,060
Our Seon Ho...

82
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,780
Thank you for being willing to come despite the sudden request.

83
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,500
Since I am a graduate of the National Police University,

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,530
I have been thinking for a long time that I wanted to train my hoobaes (juniors) at my alma mater.

85
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,090
Can I start the class beginning next week?

86
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,570
Yes. I think you can start with the first-year public administration class.

87
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,710
All right.

88
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,320
Professor Choi Hui Su is here, right?

89
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,550
Yes, she's the judo professor. Why?

90
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,160
I have been a fan for a long time,

91
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,260
since she was a medalist.

92
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,700
- She's still beautiful, right?
- Are you not married yet?

93
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,010
I was busy studying.

94
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,610
Then I'll be able to see Professor Choi at my welcoming ceremony.

95
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,490
There will be no welcoming ceremony.

96
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,870
- The school budget is tight.
- Excuse me?

97
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,330
I have a lot of work so I'll be leaving.

98
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,030
A professor should be thinking about his students!

99
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,460
Foolish 41st class, pay attention now.

100
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,430
When you're first assigned a case and go to the scene,

101
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,210
you'll get really nervous.

102
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,300
Even if you learn with theory, practice, and do image training,

103
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,800
if a culprit jumps right in front of you, your mind goes blank

104
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,140
because your life is really on the line.

105
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,360
Sometimes you will be cursed at for no reason. Also,

106
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,710
there will be times when a colleague gets hurt right in front of you.

107
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,670
Cheol Jin!

108
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,740
Eun Ju!

109
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,880
There will be a time when you lose a colleague.

110
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,250
Eun Ju!

111
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,120
There may even be a time you put handcuffs on someone close you to.

112
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,850
I once respected you

113
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,820
as a superior.

114
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,440
But what I can assure you as a sunbae is that

115
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,380
as hard as it is, you'll be just as happy.

116
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,520
The process of getting closer to the truth.

117
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,450
The times when you had a precious colleague.

118
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,210
- 1st squad! Fighting!
- Fighting!

119
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,460
The times you were protecting someone.

120
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,990
He's different from you.

121
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,150
So save your bullshit for prison, you jerk.

122
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,340
Kang Hui.

123
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,300
I think our work is worth that much.

124
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,680
So, don't think of it as stable employment for being a civil servant,

125
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,820
but stand confidently and live with pride!

126
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,460
But when there's a moment that you can't stand it,

127
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,620
call me. I'll buy you soju.

128
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,490
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

129
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,410
That's all for today's investigation class.

130
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,580
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

131
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,310
Professor!

132
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,320
Counseling and Career Development Center

133
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,680
Professor Yu Dong Man!

134
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,190
Oh Kang Hui.

135
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,540
Hello.

136
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,900
Did you eat?

137
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,540
No, not yet.

138
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,640
Let's go. I'll buy.

139
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,410
I'd like the sandwich with sausage combo, please.

140
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,860
- All right.
- Hold on.

141
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,660
I had it.

142
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,170
The bill has been paid.

143
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,710
You asked me out to eat, so I should buy.

144
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,880
Thanks.

145
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,740
Next time, you're buying.

146
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,160
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

147
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,760
So, have you decided whether it's Beom Tae or Jun Wuk?

148
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:03,970
I don't know. Some days it's this guy and other days it's the other guy.

149
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,170
Hey. How have you not decided?

150
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,190
The person you think of before you go to sleep. The person you think of when the sun rises and sets.

151
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,960
The person you want to eat something good like this with. You can't think of one?

152
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,740
Yeah.

153
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,940
The person I want to eat with when I'm eating something good?

154
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,000
She has one.

155
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,910
Do you have someone you think of, seonbae?

156
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,680
I did have someone,

157
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,910
then I didn't, and now there's someone new.

158
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,850
Can you move on that quickly?

159
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,660
Yes. I'm a philanthropist.
 (She's joking that she loves all of mankind.)

160
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,790
What about you, Kang Hui?

161
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,710
Are you and Seon Ho over for good?

162
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,160
Come on, it's been a while since the girls got together, and is the only topic men?

163
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,990
Let's talk about something else.

164
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,370
You're right. Let's talk about something else.

165
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,090
So, what field do you want to go into when you graduate, Seonbae?

166
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,720
After I go through the rotations, I will probably apply for administration,

167
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,410
or if a position as a judo professor opens here, I want to apply.

168
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,860
- Judo professor?
- Yes.

169
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,740
I thought that school life was perfect for my aptitude.

170
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,720
What about you, Eon Ju? Now that you're going to be a third-year, it's time to start thinking a lot about it.

171
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,990
I want to go into major crimes investigation.

172
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,020
Major crimes...

173
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,800
Wow. I think you'll be really great.

174
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,680
You know it really suits you, right?

175
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,220
Jae Gyeong, are you still afraid of me?

176
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,290
Jae Gyeong, what field do you want to go into?

177
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,860
I want to go into the forensic investigation team.

178
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,730
My dream has been to go into forensics since I was admitted.

179
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,700
What about you, Kang Hui?

180
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:01,530
I just wanted to be a police officer. I didn't know where I wanted to go.

181
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,720
But I knew after listening to Professor Yu Dong Man's class today.

182
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,540
I want to be an investigator in violent crimes.

183
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,780
What the hell did Professor Yu teach you?

184
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,800
It's good.

185
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,000
Tonight in the auditorium. - Jo Jun Wuk

186
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
- You don't need to know.
- Who is it?

187
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,010
- It's someone you all know.
- I think I know who it is.

188
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,230
Already? It was that obvious?

189
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,010
Then starting next semester, you won't be here anymore, Professor Yu?

190
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,150
Our team leader said that there is a truckload of guys to catch.

191
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,180
But there's a truckload of students to teach.

192
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,120
A better professor than me can come and do that.

193
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,820
I'm going to catch guys worse than I am.

194
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,610
How is the new professor of public administration?

195
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,160
I don't like him at all.

196
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,450
There you go again, judging someone without knowing them.

197
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,360
Why? Why don't you like him?

198
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,850
Are you suspicious of anything?

199
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,380
Professor Yu, is investigations the only genre you know?

200
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,480
Exactly, there are melodramas, romantic comedies,

201
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,780
or crimes of passion. These are all good too.

202
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,100
What's wrong with you again? Forget it.

203
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,140
In this lifetime, I'm going to end this life just catching bad guys.

204
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,680
Hold on. Excuse me.

205
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,190
If you live like that, would life be fun?

206
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,590
- Then what about you?
- What?

207
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,190
Are you having fun living like this?

208
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,990
If I say it's not fun?

209
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,700
Then should I make it fun?

210
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,890
Melodrama or romantic comedy, try it with me.

211
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,620
So gross.

212
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,230
So?

213
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,100
Team Leader Choi saw it and uploaded it. It's almost taken care of.

214
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,750
How?

215
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,530
The money returned by Seon Ho will be confiscated by tying it with the proceeds of the illegal gambling group.

216
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,440
Hold on. Where did that punk get that kind of money?

217
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,660
Was it his younger brother or older brother?

218
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,200
Anyway, it looks like the guy he lives with must have had it.

219
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,640
And his father provided the remainder.

220
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,660
Anyway, all the gambling sites from then are closed.

221
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,460
There's no record of any cryptocurrency to real currency exchange.

222
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,390
All he had was his confession,

223
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,190
so he said he had to pay for the crime even though the investigation was over.

224
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,420
- So we asked him to use his head.
- His head?

225
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,330
Since he was a hacker, we decided to collect some data on how they run the program

226
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,100
and support creating a tracking program.

227
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,450
Electronics Repair

228
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,860
National Police University
Kang Seon Ho

229
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,650
- You haven't eaten yet, right? Have some of this.
- What is that?

230
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,070
It's nothing special. It's samgyetang (ginseng chicken soup).

231
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,780
My wife told me to bring this for Seon Ho.

232
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,370
You didn't have to. Thank you, we'll enjoy it.

233
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,560
But did Seon Ho really quit school?

234
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Then is he not going to be a police officer?

235
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,640
I'm not sure. He must be thinking about it.

236
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,030
But I will believe and support my son no matter what he does.

237
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:14,210
Oh my. You really look like his real father now.

238
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,300
What are you saying?

239
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,660
Are you saying that I was a fake father all this time?

240
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,980
Seon Ho is my son!

241
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,390
No... I didn't mean it like that.

242
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,010
Taek Il! This samgyetang is made from a native chicken!

243
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,660
These chicken legs are really big!

244
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,260
They're like eagles! Eagles!

245
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,030
- Hey, everything is ready, right?
- Huh?

246
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,280
Yes. Yes.

247
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,620
I'm the one confessing, why are you more nervous.

248
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,810
I know. Why am I so nervous?

249
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,030
What's the plan?

250
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,250
- You will go out and when you bring Seonbae in,
- Yes.

251
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,990
- Then I will turn on the music for you.
- Sounds good.

252
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,320
Then I will hide here like this,

253
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,860
and give this to you.

254
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,630
That's when you confess.

255
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,650
Okay.

256
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:19,060
Hey, Beom Tae, you liked her too. Are you sure you're okay?

257
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,580
You said you'd confess to her first.

258
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,980
And you're my friend.

259
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,700
If you get dumped, then it's my turn and you have to help me.

260
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,780
Hey, punk, why would I get dumped? Huh?

261
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll be back. I'll bring her in.

262
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,940
Okay. Fighting!

263
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,500
- Beom Tae!
- What?

264
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,010
I like you more than I thought.

265
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,650
I will love you more today than yesterday.

266
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,870
- Are you practicing your confession?
- Yes.

267
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,670
Should I lower my voice more?

268
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,440
Yes, lower.

269
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,720
- I think the cave (deep) voice would be good.
- Okay.

270
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,520
- Lower voice.
- I'll be back.

271
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,210
Fighting!

272
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,880
They're here. They're here.

273
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,590
Oh my.

274
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,520
I will love you more today than yesterday.

275
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,510
♫ Never so far again ♫

276
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:58,520
♫ Never so far again ♫

277
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,030
♫ Never again without the hand ♫

278
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,390
♫ That warms my heart ♫

279
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,850
Oh! Seonbae.

280
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,450
Jun Wuk is...

281
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,880
I mean...

282
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,120
I mean... Jun Wuk. Where did Jun Wuk...?

283
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,950
Jun Wuk told me to go.

284
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,060
He said you will be here.

285
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,630
What?

286
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,640
I like you more than I thought.

287
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,910
Jun Wuk said you have something to tell me.

288
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,930
No Beom Tae.

289
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,150
I like you.

290
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,180
What?

291
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,760
I said I like you...

292
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,500
Hey! I can't hear you.

293
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,280
I said I like you, Lee Eon Ju.

294
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,850
♫ I'm walking in the street ♫

295
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,360
♫ I follow the first steps ♫

296
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,040
♫ I'm searching for something ♫

297
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,640
♫ That we all dreamed of ♫

298
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,200
♫ I'll never be the same again ♫

299
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,490
♫ The most curious places ♫

300
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,140
Then let's try dating.

301
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,220
Friendship, is that it?

302
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,740
Conceding, that's what it is.

303
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,840
Conceding?

304
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,100
To be honest, my face is handsome and I'm cute.

305
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,440
I'm also charming.

306
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,900
I have it all,

307
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,190
but Beom Tae is more attractive the more you see him.

308
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,230
But Noona Eon Ju has known Beom Tae for a while now,

309
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:15,830
so I thought she'd recognize it now, Beom Tae's charms.

310
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,660
Hey, Jo Jun Wuk, are you crying?

311
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,690
I'm not.

312
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,960
Then you shouldn't have pretended.

313
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,060
You pretended to be cool and all, and you're crying? Are you crazy?

314
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,860
I mean, something went in my eye.

315
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,060
I'm okay.

316
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,150
My goodness, everyone except for me.

317
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,610
Melodrama or romantic comedy, try it with me.

318
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,820
I must be crazy. Choi Hui Su, what are you thinking right now?

319
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,710
Be mine.

320
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,180
Are you crazy?! Stop it! Don't imagine that!

321
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,880
- Darling ...
- This crazy—

322
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,610
It's because my body is weak. Let's go exercise.

323
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,680
Yes, let's exercise.

324
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,440
The professor must be having a hard time too.

325
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,660
It's hard.

326
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,830
Something came from the school.

327
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,420
National Police University

328
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,900
♫ You are with me, ♫

329
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,360
Let's go, Kang Hui.

330
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,800
♫ who want to have the same dream ♫

331
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:05,550
♫ as the person who fills the empty space ♫

332
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:12,360
♫ where there was no dream ♫

333
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:21,560
♫ If someone were to ask me, who is in my heart ♫

334
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,770
♫ I would say, it’s you ♫

335
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:34,110
♫ Stay with me Stay hold me in your mind ♫

336
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:41,910
♫ In the night, wanting to see you, speaking to myself, ♫

337
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:50,190
♫ I love you so much, more than myself, ♫

338
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:56,770
♫ You descended like a star ♫

339
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,390
Two years later

340
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,510
Is someone coming to pick you up? Family?

341
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,160
No. I told them not to come. It's not a good situation to be seen in.

342
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,790
Then no one is coming?

343
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,370
There aren't that many taxis here.

344
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,150
Well, I'm just going to walk alone.

345
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,640
I'll think about what I'm going to do from now on.

346
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,090
Mentor...

347
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,160
You should have come out faster, you jerk.

348
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,550
Hurry up and get in, punk. I have to go to the scene again.

349
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,320
Jungan Prison

350
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,130
Did you come empty-handed? You didn't bring tofu?

351
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,830
I brought tofu and something else.

352
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,280
You got a new car.

353
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,990
What is this?

354
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:45,430
Can't you tell it's real estate documents? Twenty million won deposit and 1.5 million won rest.
Commercial Lease Agreement

355
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:51,540
I put down the twenty million won and you pay the 1.5 million won every month from now on.

356
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,850
Mentor...

357
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,490
It's a commercial building in front of the school.

358
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,400
When I passed by it,

359
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,570
it seemed like a lot of people passed by, and it doesn't seem bad for doing a business.

360
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,690
So, get it together, and try to do it right, you punk.

361
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,620
If you're in front of the National Police University, then you won't do anything wrong.

362
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,530
You can keep an eye on the students growing up. I would really like that.

363
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,350
Don't you hate me?

364
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,870
Why are you asking a ridiculous question?

365
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,560
Hey. You committed a crime. You paid for your crime.

366
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,360
I'm sure you had enough time to reflect on yourself.

367
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,160
If you do something like that again, I'll kill you myself.

368
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,910
Why would I hate you?

369
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,790
Don't ever forget that I put twenty million won of my money down for a deposit and run the business.

370
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,100
I'm going to check in unexpectedly

371
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,100
to see what you are doing, if you're not causing trouble there, whether you're running the business well or not,

372
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,460
whether you're keeping good food hygiene.

373
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,620
But...

374
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,670
are they not going to lower the monthly rent? 1.5 million won is a lot.

375
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,300
Wow, this jerk.

376
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,660
You came out of prison as a scammer.

377
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,390
I'm sorry, Mentor.

378
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,850
And thank you for everything.

379
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,430
Shut up and eat your soondubu (soft tofu stew).

380
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,860
How can I eat with my mouth shut?

381
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,720
This tofu, tofu, it's all yours.

382
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,090
But what about the jerk, Kang Seon Ho?

383
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,720
I don't need the whole family to come to the college entrance ceremony.

384
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,260
Hey, there's just the three of us. We have to come!

385
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,200
Always making such a big deal!

386
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,470
Hey, I promised that I'd be there.

387
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,990
Crazy punk...

388
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,600
Don't get yourself in any trouble!

389
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,890
How could I not when I'm young and my blood is hot and I'm in my youth!

390
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,030
I'll show you! I'll get into trouble properly!

391
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,600
And get a girlfriend, too.

392
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,920
How are you still the same after getting discharged from military service?

393
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,970
Father, I'll drive.

394
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,510
You worked so hard to get his tuition together.

395
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,540
No, you're the one who worked so hard.

396
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,020
You two are so alike!

397
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,580
Let's go, we'll be late.

398
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,300
Hey, you look good. You do!

399
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,940
It's the first day, though!

400
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,630
I'm glad I didn't miss you. Congratulations on your first day of college!

401
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,800
Oh, thank you!

402
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,980
I'm so proud of you! How did you get into college right after getting discharged?

403
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,350
- It's nothing.
- We'll be late, let's go.

404
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,890
But you're going to be a sports major?

405
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:08,190
- Yes, Judo.
- Oh, Judo! That's amazing.

406
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,040
Police University

407
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,180
Oh no. Am I getting a wrinkle now that I'm in my third year?

408
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,520
You're pretty anyway. Let's hurry up and go.

409
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Hey, try some of this. It's really nice.

410
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,080
Really?

411
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,960
- It really is nice.
- Isn't it?
- Let me try some more.

412
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,890
Oh, but is the entrance ceremony over yet?

413
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:01,650
Since it's Cheongram Training, everyone should be gathered in the auditorium.

414
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,190
Stand up.

415
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,680
Sit down. Stand up!

416
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,650
Is that all you got?!

417
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,410
Listen to you. You sound great after all that practice every night.

418
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,010
Was it good? Do you want to go home?

419
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,900
Hold on.

420
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,060
Oh, Eon Ju. No, no. It's fine.

421
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,400
Let's go to the Cheongram Training.

422
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,510
Hey bro, Na Rae called me again last night.

423
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,460
Please take care of your own girlfriend! She calls me every time she can't get a hold of you for even ten minutes!

424
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,150
- Are you jealous?
- What?
- Then get yourself a girlfriend!

425
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,350
Let's go meet the 43rd class.

426
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:11,180
2023 Police University Cheongram Training Entrance Ceremony

427
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,980
Nice to meet you all.

428
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,720
I'm Chief Superintendent Gwon Hyeok Pil, I will be teaching your Cheongram education.
2023 National Police University Cheongram Education Entrance Ceremony

429
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,360
From this moment on, the candidates here will be divided into three squads

430
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,390
for mobile group training.

431
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,500
Each squad needs a squad leader.

432
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,890
Are there any candidates who want to be the squad leaders?

433
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,570
Park Jin Wu, a cadet at the National Police University. I will do my best.

434
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,600
Park Min Gyu, a cadet at the National Police University. I will do my best!

435
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,510
Good.

436
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,790
What about for the second squad?

437
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,950
Yun Ji Hye, a cadet at the National Police University. I'd like to apply.

438
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,360
Oh Kang Hui, a cadet at the National Police University. I'd like to apply.

439
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,120
Good. And for the last third squad?

440
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:19,740
Kang Seon Ho, a cadet at the National Police University.

441
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,780
I'm confident that I will do well this time.

442
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,270
♫ My heart keeps pounding, you're dazzling like a shining star ♫

443
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,810
♫ When I see you, I'm filled with the thoughts of you ♫

444
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,840
You'll have to do well this time.

445
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,970
♫ The place you and I are going to look toward is the same ♫

446
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,180
♫ We are going to dream the same dream again,
Can you feel it? ♫

447
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,440
♫  Can you feel it? ♫

448
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,670
♫ That's what I want to say only to you ♫

449
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:59,190
♫ That's what I still must hear only from you (Still me) ♫

450
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,680
♫ Love isn't a big deal ♫

451
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,850
♫ I'm going to take a step forward now feeling great
Get ready ♫

452
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,780
♫  Get ready ♫

453
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,770
For the first time since I entered this school, I searched through the statute.

454
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:20,080
It's impossible for re-admission after dropping out, but there seemed to be exceptions.
Drop-out Application

455
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,860
What is it you want to say?

456
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,180
I wanted to check.

457
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:30,280
I'm afraid I'll give him false hope again.

458
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,720
I'm afraid I'll mess things up with my emotions.

459
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,110
That's why I'm here.

460
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,320
Since you saw him too, Professor Gwon,

461
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,960
but if you say no, then it's a no.

462
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:50,780
Do you think that student Kang Seon Ho can become a good police officer, Professor Yu?

463
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,650
He is lacking. He is also slow-witted.

464
00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:00,830
But I think that he will at least be a better police officer than me.

465
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,170
That's why I don't want to close the opportunity

466
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,230
for that kid, who is still lacking,

467
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,290
the chance to learn from good superiors

468
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,870
and to pursue his dreams with his friends. That's all.

469
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,470
Is there really no other way?

470
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,350
There is one.

471
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,090
Pretending none of it happened.

472
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:45,130
Notice of Cancellation of Admission to the National Police University.

473
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,540
Notice of Cancellation of Admission to the National Police University.

474
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,570
The above person passed the general admission process for the 2021 school year,

475
00:38:54,570 --> 00:39:01,420
but we would like to cancel the acceptance due to the above reasons. September 21, 2021.

476
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,410
So that's what happened.

477
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,970
I thought it was over,

478
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,860
because you didn't answer our calls, Seon Ho.

479
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,730
Exactly.

480
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:26,860
Do you know how many times we visited you, you punk?

481
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,370
I'm sorry. I wanted to appear confidently

482
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,930
when I was qualified.

483
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,500
But it worked out really well. It's really good.

484
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,370
Are the trainers having fun with the cadets right now?

485
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,030
Let me join too.

486
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:10,120
You know we have ranks here, right? Even if we are friends, at school call us seonbae.

487
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,240
Yes, Sunbaenim.

488
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,660
Did you see Kang Hui?

489
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,480
Not yet.

490
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,290
Bro. Shouldn't you have gone to see Kang Hui first?

491
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,280
After completing Cheongram training, and if I get accepted, I was going to go to Kang Hui then.

492
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,320
All right.

493
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,620
Then let's finish the Cheongram training first. What's the next training course?

494
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,450
It's 'Panting' hill, right?

495
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,670
Hey. They still do that?

496
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,830
Student Kang Seon Ho, get up.

497
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,820
- Stand up.
- Get up!

498
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,310
Did you not hear us, Cadet?!

499
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,170
Stand up. Stand up quickly!

500
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,900
Sit. Sit. Sit.

501
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
- Quickly! Sit.
- Get up!

502
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,120
- What are you doing?
- Get up!

503
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,920
You scared me.

504
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,090
Youth. There are moments that cannot be captured in one word.

505
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,030
- Stop chasing me, Ahjussi!
- Stop there, you jerk!

506
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,290
Hey! Stop right there...

507
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:24,620
Hey. When I was young, punk!

508
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,090
I ran 100 meters in ten seconds, you jerk!

509
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,250
Then you would have become a track and field athlete instead of a detective.

510
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,880
What? I've heard that before...

511
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,200
Hey, is it a rule for people your age not to lose an argument?

512
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,870
This boomer knows all the national rules.

513
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,430
Boomer?!

514
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:48,920
I'm going to catch you today and end my police career! Come here, you punk!

515
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,650
Come here, you punk!

516
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,030
That punk keeps laughing, it's pissing me off!

517
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,310
You think it's funny calling me a boomer?! You punk!

518
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,080
The moment you never give up.

519
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,270
Someone's here. Oh my goodness, a customer is here.

520
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,010
Welcome!

521
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,510
You're so loud.

522
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,630
Come this way, please.

523
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:23,300
Are you here with a group?

524
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,520
Please give me some ice water.

525
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,410
Ice water. Yes, here you go.

526
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,990
Here you go.

527
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,440
What's good here?

528
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,730
Tofu kimchi is our popular dish.

529
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,840
Tofu kimchi?

530
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,140
Yes. My mentor advised me to live according to the law, so—

531
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,910
That's good.
- I was talking...

532
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:46,680
I'm so good at frying kimchi.

533
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,000
Excuse me?

534
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,450
Recruiting part-time. Let's work together.
Cheol Jin's Pub

535
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,130
You're looking for part-time work here?

536
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:59,010
But I take care of the kitchen, so I'm looking for a server.

537
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,490
- Bravo.
- Bravo?

538
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,690
That works out even better.

539
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,370
Let's see.

540
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,390
Where are you going?

541
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,550
The interior is a bit tacky, right?
Your one and only mentor. Yu Dong Man.

542
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,140
It is?

543
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,900
Remove this.

544
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,800
You can change things one by one.

545
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,060
Oh right! Can I get the four insurances here?

546
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,290
- Four insurances?
- You give an annual bonus too, right?

547
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,440
- What?
- And there will be severance pay.

548
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,400
Okay.

549
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,370
Let's keep the business clean.

550
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,570
My daughter is...

551
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,340
a cop.

552
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,970
So?

553
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:49,310
It may be scary, but the moments you start a new beginning.

554
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,430
What are you doing this time?

555
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,100
Yes...

556
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,040
I heard that the vegetables grown in our prison

557
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,320
go to a nearby orphanage.

558
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,310
My goodness.

559
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,810
Have you finished caring for the inmate?

560
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,680
Oh, yes. He got really healthy.

561
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,770
These days, that person works out with me every morning.

562
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:29,500
Being a model prisoner is good, but take care of yourself.

563
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,100
All right.

564
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,000
We're going to practice now at a nearby police station.

565
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,290
So I can't come as often as before.

566
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,030
Today is also my last day of leave.

567
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,630
Is it already that time?

568
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,520
You know that you have to be

569
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,590
really careful when you go to practice, right?

570
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,780
Of course, I know.

571
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,820
I have to protect myself in order to protect the citizens.

572
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,800
That's right.

573
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:06,100
The moment you make mistakes, have regrets, reflect on yourself,

574
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,340
and stand up again.

575
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,570
Also...

576
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:46,360
♫ Stay with me Stay hold me in your mind ♫

577
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:54,080
♫ In the night, wanting to see you, speaking to myself, ♫

578
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,130
♫ I love you so much, ♫

579
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,550
He was in a car crash.

580
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,050
He is a male in his twenties who lost consciousness at the scene.

581
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,000
Hurry inside.

582
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,030
Thank you. You did a great job.

583
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,700
No, I didn't do anything.

584
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:44,160
Thanks to your immediate action in the situation, the patient has survived a critical condition.

585
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,130
I'll get going, I'm running late.

586
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,290
Goodbye. Thank you so much.

587
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:51,090
♫ When I see you, time stops ♫

588
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:57,290

592
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,890
Why did you run here? I was going to wait until you came.

593
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:28,570
♫ asks how I feel ♫

594
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,740
I'm... not going anywhere now.

595
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:40,670
Even if I die, I'm not going anywhere, Kang Hui.

596
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,170
Even if you push me to go, even if you don't like me, even if you're sick and tired of me...

597
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,520
♫ We begin a beginning which has no end ♫

00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,550

If you go again,

603
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,670

00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:26,050
♫ Yes, I'll stay with you now ♫

613
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:31,260

♫ I like everything, I just like it ♫

♫ Because you will be my last love ♫

617
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,190
Are you doing well?

618
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,470
I feel like I'm dying.

619
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,890
Look at you sounding like you've been running to death for a year.

620
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,920
It was nice when I was in school.

621
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,700
The scene is ...

622
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,730
Professor, don't you want to go back to the school?

623
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,040
Are you crazy?!

624
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,830
Team Leader.

625
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,780
- What about the report?
- On your desk. I'm going to the scene.

626
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,770
Wait a moment. Here.

627
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,580
Catch all the bad guys today!

628
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,250
- Inspector Ju! Fighting!
- Fighting!

629
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,470
And don't get hurt!

630
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,270
Bird

631
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,530
Kang has logged on.

632
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,060
Kang: Hyung!

633
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,280
Kang: I got into the National Police University.

634
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,250
Kang: Hyung!
Kang: I got into the National Police University.

635
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,450
That dummy.

636
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,960
The 2025 New Police Inspector & Senior Inspector Appointment Ceremony

637
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:13,270
Father, I'm now a police officer.

638
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,190
You're a police officer. You're a police officer.

639
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,700
- Eon Ju!
- Oppa.

640
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,200
- It's was hard to get here, right?
- No.

641
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,750
Congratulations on graduating.

642
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,050
Thank you. My dad is here.

643
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,650
Father!

644
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,230
- Our Eon Ju.
- When did you get here?

645
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,620
You look pretty today.

646
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,650
Practically his daughter-in-law.

647
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,190
Here. Congratulations to you too, Jun Wuk.

648
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,120
Thank you, sir.

649
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,120
You have to date now too.

650
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,830
I will take care of it myself.

651
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,610
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

652
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:45,370
Then, Sunbae, are you in Mapo-gu?

653
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,220
I heard that's the hardest place.

654
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,930
That district. It's fun. But if it's fun,

655
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,400
why do I keep crying?

656
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,400
You too? Me too.

657
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,100
I'm always cleaning up drunk people's vomit.

658
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,300
Me too.

659
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,510
- Is it hard?
- Yes.

660
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,780
Has it been hard on you? You've been having a hard time.

661
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,440
Hold on.

662
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,690
It's been the toughest for me.

663
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,940
Don't do it. Stop.

664
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,730
What are you talking about?

665
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,170
- Let's go.
- I mean, it's hard for me.

666
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,030
So gross.

667
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,530
Our Mapo station is so hard–

668
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,550
That's enough. Go. Go.

669
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,710
Let's go.

670
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,100
Mom!

671
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,750
What flowers cost 35,000 won?

672
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:45,430
Why is the price so high? You can't even eat it.

673
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,950
You never bought flowers for me before.

674
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:49,880
What are you fussing about?

675
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,230
This is all about tactics.

676
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,110
Anyway, don't date a guy who buys you flowers.

677
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:01,850
Even if you couldn't make it to the entrance ceremony, you came to my graduation.

678
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,370
Of course, I should be here.

679
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,720
I should do my very best to come here.

680
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,790
You don't know how much I wanted to come.

681
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,120
What about your boyfriend?

682
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,680
Kang Hui.

683
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,620
I guess I should date a guy who buys me flowers. Mom, you shouldn't.

684
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,430
You don't know how to pick men.

685
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:41,460
Hello, ma'am.

686
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,720
Did you eat yet?

687
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,480
Just about.

688
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,030
Did you use your holiday leave to come here today?

689
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,690
No, half day.

690
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,020
Oh, half day.

691
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,240
Let's take a picture together, with Kang Hui, all of us.

692
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,810
No, I'm fine. You two stand together.

693
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,210
He said the three of us. Let's take one together.

694
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,580
Here.

695
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,220
Okay, I'm taking the picture.

696
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:14,190
One, two, three.

697
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,260
- It's really nice, it's so convenient.
- It's cool.

698
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,500
The two people I love are here together.

699
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,770
For those who are in the hall, please take a seat.

700
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,560
We will start

701
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,690
the appointment ceremony for the 2025 new police officer superintendents.

702
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,350
Salute to the school president.

703
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:23,230
Salute!

704
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,750
The 2025 New Police Inspector & Senior Inspector Appointment Ceremony

705
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,320
At ease!

706
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,890
The Commissioner of the National Police Agency

707
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:33,640
will present a letter of appointment.

708
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,700
Inspector Oh Kang Hui.

709
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,260
Salute!

710
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,170
Inspector No Beom Tae.

711
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,910
Salute!

712
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,400
Inspector Park Min Gyu.

713
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,470
Salute!

714
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:18,660
Inspector Jo Jun Wuk.

715
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,210
Salute!

716
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,020
Inspector Min Jae Gyeong.

717
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,020
Salute!

718
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,900
Lastly, we will end the ceremony by reciting the pledge to be police officers of civil rights.

719
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:42,690
A pledge to be police officers of human rights.

720
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:49,380
One. We will become police officers of civil rights who protect the freedom and rights of all people.

721
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:55,840
One. We will become fair police officers who enforce the law according to our conscience.

722
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:02,410
One. We will become warm police officers who protect the socially disadvantaged.

723
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:07,420
Turn around!

724
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,170
Salute to your seonbae police officers and your parents!

725
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:15,640
Salute!

726
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:53,020
The 2025 New Police Inspector & Senior Inspector Appointment Ceremony

727
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,210
Are you jealous?

728
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:02,090
Professor!

729
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,320
You said you were busy.

730
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,290
No matter how busy I am, shouldn't I watch those dummies graduate?

731
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,730
It would have been nice if you graduated with them.

732
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:22,180
No. I'm glad I'm doing it separately.

733
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,850
Don't I have to learn a lot more before I go and run in the field with you?

734
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:31,260
Oh my goodness, then how much longer do I need to wait for you?

735
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,800
Since I'm in my third year, so I'll graduate in two years,

736
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,320
and my military service for two years...

737
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,570
Hey! Do you want to come when I'm fifty?!

738
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:44,940
I'll hurry up and go. It looks like you are desperately waiting.

739
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,530
Professor.

740
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:55,860
I've always been curious.

741
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:00,510
What do people find interesting? What makes them feel so desperate?

742
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:03,710
What do they work so hard for?

743
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,710
One, two, three.

744
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:07,170
But this thought occurred to me.

745
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:12,490
I must have been that kind of person to someone while I was at the National Police University.

746
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:15,730
A person who is desperate works hard

747
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:18,970
and enjoys it.

748
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:24,570
I was able to know because I had my father, Kang Hui, my friends,

749
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:29,730
and you, Professor.

750
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,300
I'm that kind of person, too.

751
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,170
- Are you the one graduating?
- Professor.

752
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:45,620
My heart skipped a beat because of you.

753
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:50,570
I thought I was old. I thought my body and mind were all old now.

754
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,050
But I wasn't.

755
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:56,850
Because of you punk, I became a young man again.

756
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:04,000
I quit smoking but I can give up nicotine gum.

757
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:09,450
Seon Ho! Professor Yu!

758
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:11,910
Hurry up, get over here! So we can take a picture!

759
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:15,090
- Hurry!
- Professor, hurry!

760
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,000
Professor Gwon!

761
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:23,700
Professor Gwon, you're so angry these days.

762
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,670
Congratulations.

763
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,900
