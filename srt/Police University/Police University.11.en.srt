1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,520
Yes, I'm on my way so get the boat ready.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,120
Okay.

3
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,830
Caught you.

4
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,110
Are you surprised, asshole?

5
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,790
Professor. Are you all right?

6
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,580
This bastard, do you know who you're messing with?

7
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,520
♫  Yes, at the time  ♫

8
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,680
♫  when you are too exhausted  ♫

9
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,590
♫  When you are pointlessly lonely  ♫

10
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,140
♫  you can call my name  ♫

11
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,210
♫  Okay, when your heart is breaking  ♫

12
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,310
♫  Okay, when your heart is breaking  ♫

13
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,190
♫  When you sometimes cry  ♫

14
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,000
♫  you can come to me  ♫

15
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,480
♫  On a tough day in the distant future  ♫

16
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,110
♫  while you smile  ♫

17
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,980
Go Deok Bae, you are under arrest on charges of opening a gambling operation,

18
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,810
violating the Game Industry Promotion Act,

19
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,640
violating the Electronic Financial Transactions Act,

20
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,770
violating the Crime Proceeds Concealment Control Act,

21
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,550
violating the Telecommunications Business Act,

22
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,420
and for violating the Information and Communication Network Act.

23
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,060
You have the right to consult an attorney

24
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,720
and the right to remain silent.

25
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,380
You have the right to defend yourself,

26
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,830
and the right to request the court to review the legality of your arrest without a warrant.

27
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,310
But don't do it, jerk,

28
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,860
because you're dead meat now.

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,140
This jerk.

30
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,590
Let me go! I said let me go!

31
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,040
Stop right there! I've got you!

32
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,910
Seriously, you jerk!

33
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,160
Jerk!

34
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,540
Stop! Stop right there!

35
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,490
No! No! Don't go!

36
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,240
Get him! Get him!

37
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,010
I'll check over here.

38
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,380
Dong Man! Dong Man!

39
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,300
Why are you so late?!

40
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,680
We lost one of the culprits because we didn't have enough people!

41
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,500
Hey! Are you all right?

42
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,390
Why is that man here?

43
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,800
Do you think it's easy to get a warrant at this hour?

44
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,870
The chief got the warrant directly, punk.

45
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,980
What? Why?

46
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,990
- What do you mean why?
- Inspector Yu.

47
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,420
Good work.

48
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,140
Damn it.

49
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,440
From now on, Investigation Team 1 will take over

50
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,170
and finish it thoroughly.

51
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,820
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,110
All the suspects involved were found

53
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,080
and arrested, without any missing.

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,620
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,760
Thanks to Inspector Yu, you'll get a promotion.

56
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,190
Aish, what was that?

57
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,520
Aren't they on the same side?

58
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,230
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

59
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,080
You can give that to me.

60
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,880
Excuse me...

61
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,700
Oh, here you go.

62
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,350
Thank you.

63
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,370
Are you all right?

64
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,110
Yeah. Let's go.

65
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,290
I think this is my first time seeing a real-time arrest scene.

66
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,710
Me too.

67
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,480
But the culprit who ran away,

68
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,250
they'll be able to catch him right away, right?

69
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,640
Of course. There are CCTVs all over the place.

70
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,760
- But you're really not hurt anywhere, right?
- Yes.

71
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,260
Thanks to the professor.

72
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,200
I didn't get hurt either.

73
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,440
Guys, to celebrate our Kang's investigation team's

74
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,570
good ending of its first investigation,

75
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,170
shouldn't we go on a trip somewhere?

76
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,950
A trip? Where?

77
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,390
- The beach!
- The beach?!

78
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,970
How does the beach sound?

79
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,540
Should we go have fun somewhere before our vacation ends?

80
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,540
What do you think?

81
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,740
Well... the weather is hot too.

82
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,280
I think there's going to be a lot of traffic because it's vacation season.

83
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,200
True.

84
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,470
But if you guys want to go, then just go.

85
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,970
Get up, everyone.

86
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,450
You have to go home before the vacation ends.

87
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,300
♫ Fly away facing tomorrow now ♫

88
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,070
♫ Fly away high until the end ♫

89
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,520
♫ The hot sun isn't in that sky there ♫

90
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,160
♫ I found it (I found it) in my heart (in my heart) ♫

91
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,170
So, how do you feel?

92
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,180
What are you talking about?

93
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,700
The case you've been investigating for a long time has finally ended.

94
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,200
What about it, punk?

95
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,040
It's natural for the police to catch criminals.

96
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,700
What's there to be happy about?

97
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,850
Just say that you are happy.

98
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,520
What's there to be happy about?

99
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,070
Working in public affairs

100
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,660
means performing objectively as a public official.

101
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,880
It can't become a means of your own personal satisfaction.

102
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,290
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,530
But since you two are not public officials yet, and you're still students,

104
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,780
if you're happy, well, I guess that would be all right.

105
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,860
You weren't bad for it being your first time.

106
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,780
- The professor...
- ...told us that we did a good job.

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,800
I meant it wasn't bad.

108
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,320
Thank you for taking me home.

109
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,880
I'm the one that's thankful.

110
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,540
Thanks to you, I was able to drive speedily and feel so much better.

111
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,200
Oh! Me too. Especially when you drove around the corners,

112
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,460
it relieved all my stress.

113
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,490
What's this? Are you a mini Choi Hui Su?

114
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,690
Enjoy the rest of your vacation.

115
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,560
And have a lot of dates with Seon Ho.

116
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,220
Excuse me?

117
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,630
Hey, why are you so surprised?

118
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,390
Everyone knows that you're dating except Beom Tae.

119
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,230
Still, be careful driving home.

120
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,500
I want to see you for a long time.

121
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,000
I will see you when school starts, Professor.

122
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,790
Then are you going to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency right away?

123
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,100
Yes. I have to go and write a witness statement.

124
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,410
Oh, that one man earlier that got away at the scene.

125
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,710
I'm going to catch him soon,

126
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,660
but be careful just in case.

127
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,250
Well, you're going to be there for me.

128
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,190
I'm not scared at all if you're there for me.

129
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,120
Also, thank you for saving me earlier.

130
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,800
Punk, am I your bodyguard?

131
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,770
Don't ruin the mood. Seriously.

132
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,920
I'll see you at school when the semester starts, right?

133
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,950
Right?

134
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,110
Of course, you punk. Can't you see that I have nowhere else to go?

135
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,340
See you when school starts.

136
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,220
Hey, punk!

137
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,410
I wouldn't have been able to arrest that jerk without you.

138
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,850
It's all thanks to my partner.

139
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:19,190
And ... to be honest, catching the culprit today

140
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,620
makes me incredibly happy.

141
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,090
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

142
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,420
- You're here because of the gambling ring?
- Yeah, well.

143
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,270
Do you have good news?

144
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,100
Hold on.

145
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,560
Hyungnim! Hyungnim! As of today, I have decided to serve you, Inspector Yu.

146
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,350
After all, you are not jjapsae (derogatory, like 'pig) but a police officer,

147
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,340
and you are very loyal.

148
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,190
Forget it! Just write the article thoroughly, punk.

149
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,650
Don't just pick a good title and have no content. Got it?

150
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,470
Just leave it to me. You were the one that called me first, so I will repay you with an article.

151
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,400
But have you still not caught the culprit that got away at the scene?

152
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,360
His name is Jang Jae Gyu. He's thirty years old. Well, as you can see from before...

153
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,620
Five crimes before the fraud, attempted murder, and two assaults.

154
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,180
Wow, this jerk is a total mess.

155
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,910
It took a while to figure out where he lived.

156
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,990
The legwork started today.

157
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,360
Okay.

158
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,330
Oh, that's right. Sunbae. In the witness statement,

159
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,110
you wrote that you saw Go Deok Bae talking on the phone while he was coming out.

160
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,450
Yes, why?

161
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,880
The seized evidence came over from the investigation team,

162
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,620
but I couldn't find the cell phone even though I searched through everything.

163
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,330
What?

164
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,590
We're all finished, right?

165
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:07,810
Well, you confessed to everything since the evidence is sparse.

166
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,220
But I have something I really wanted to ask you, Go Deok Bae.

167
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,170
If you look at the flow of funds for the illegal gambling groups you operated,

168
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,560
you always, diligently,

169
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,360
went to the ATM every month for six years to withdraw cash.

170
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,460
That's also 80% of the profits.

171
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,380
There's no way all that money was kept somewhere safe without being used.

172
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,750
Where did you spend all that money you saved up?

173
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,750
Where else would I have used it? I used it somewhere good.

174
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,220
What did you do with your cell phone?

175
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,870
I clearly saw you talking on your cell phone,

176
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,540
so don't mess around and answer me straight away.

177
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,390
Where is it, you bastard?

178
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,250
What cell phone?

179
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,020
I don't know what you're talking about, Professor Yu Dong Man.

180
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,200
Even after a confession, are you going to pretend you don't know what I'm talking about?

181
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,870
There's something on that cell phone, isn't there?

182
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,400
Am I obligated to answer questions from someone who is not even the

183
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,630
investigator in charge, Team leader Choi Gil Yong?

184
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,570
Why are you so scared? It's obvious.

185
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
Statement Recording Room

186
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,630
Punk, he's not speaking with a dialect anymore!

187
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,330
- What do you want, punk?
- Hello, Professor!

188
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,120
Move your phone off of your ears and put the screen farther out.

189
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,690
From here, from here. Good.

190
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,020
What are you guys doing?

191
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,640
We came to the beach to celebrate Kang's Investigation team's first investigation!

192
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,610
Professor! Can you see it?

193
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,240
It's the Emerald Sea!

194
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,350
Stop looking at a boring building and look at the sea too.

195
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,250
Here.

196
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,480
Professor? What happened? Professor?

197
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,820
He hung up the phone.

198
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,050
But he stayed on longer than Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil. Professor Gwon lasted one second.

199
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,990
Hey, Beom Tae. Take a picture of me with the ocean in the background.

200
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,100
Again?! Hey! I took over a hundred pictures earlier!

201
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,620
- You need to take 1000 photos. Come on, hurry up.
- Seriously?!

202
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,490
Okay, okay. Stay right there. Wait. All right, nice. Smile.

203
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,260
Smile wide. Cheese.

204
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,910
Looks good. Wow, looks good.

205
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,760
The ocean is really nice.

206
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,030
You're right. I feel refreshed.

207
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,780
Shall we walk for a bit? It'll be another thirty minutes for the guys to take pictures.

208
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,660
Hey, I really took a lot of photos. There are so many, look.

209
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,230
Wow, it's so tiring.

210
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,030
- Hey, Beom Tae, let's go.
- Where?

211
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,130
- Let's go.
- Why? Why?
- Because.

212
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,010
What? Where are we going? Why?

213
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,470
Why?

214
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:17,400
♫ You are with me, who want to have the same dream ♫

215
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:25,450
♫ as the person who fills the empty space where there was no dream ♫

216
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,610
♫ and am looking at the same place ♫

217
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,900
- Then will your mother have a retrial?
- Yes.

218
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,860
The lawyer called me this morning.

219
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,280
Really? That's really a relief, Kang Hui.

220
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,990
It seems like you are happier about it.

221
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,100
I was worried that I might become a police officer for nothing

222
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,920
and have to arrest my mom.

223
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,000
I think it's a good thing I decided to be a police officer.

224
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,730
I'm saving my mom like this.

225
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,590
Oh, is it a flea market?

226
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:06,350
♫ I love you so much, so much more than myself ♫

227
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,570
It's pretty.

228
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,260
They're really nice.

229
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,960
It's nice. Try it on.

230
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,790
♫ Now, not in front of me, would you ♫

231
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:27,460
♫ come close, closer beside me now. ♫

232
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,460
Before your mother's trial starts, let's go visit her together.

233
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,770
- Visit?
- Yes.

234
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,660
I want to meet your mother in person and talk with her.

235
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,840
About what?

236
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,130
Tell her that we're dating?! Are you crazy?!

237
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,430
No. Tell her that she has an amazing daughter.

238
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,100
But is it still a secret from the guys that we are dating?

239
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,550
No. It's because my mom will nag and the guys should know.

240
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,060
Let's go and tell the guys.

241
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,580
Wh— Really?

242
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Of course, it's true, punk! You were the only one who didn't know. Just you.

243
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,090
How could they keep it a secret from just me?

244
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,100
So that's why we have to hurry up and leave.

245
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,650
Wait! Hey, but still,

246
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,960
how can we just leave them here?

247
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,590
There are all these buses. They'll figure it out on their own.

248
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,960
Just trust me.

249
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,160
What would you know, you're single.

250
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,170
Wh-What do you mean single?

251
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,830
Hey, hey! Have you ever had a girlfriend?

252
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,430
I did have one. When I studied abroad. Her name was Krystal.

253
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,740
Hey, really? You must have really had one.

254
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,090
She really loved me.

255
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,560
Hey, you really had one.

256
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,270
Of course, I did.

257
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,280
Where did you meet her?

258
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,090
When I was studying in LA, I had a house party.

259
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,680
- Wow.
- That's when I met her.

260
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,470
That's like a movie! How old was she?

261
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,830
- Twenty-one years old.
- Twenty-one?

262
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,830
- Was she pretty?
- The prettiest.

263
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,670
Where did they go to take pictures?

264
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,190
Jun Wuk is not answering either.

265
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,100
Dumb and Dumber... No way...

266
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,060
Have a good time.

267
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,200
By the way, they said there are no direct buses to Seoul.

268
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,100
Damn, these crazy punks.

269
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,110
One hundred percent there is something on that cell phone.

270
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,200
I will find it no matter what.

271
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,820
I'm sure it's somewhere here.

272
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,660
Save me!

273
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,370
What is this?

274
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,140
I like scallops too.

275
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,070
Please eat this.

276
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,600
It must have been difficult for you to come.

277
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,230
Of course, I should have come.

278
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,990
You don't have your wallets and the taxi fare was $200.

279
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,510
But someone doesn't look happy at all.

280
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,550
That's not true.

281
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,420
- Can we have one soju and one beer please?
- All right.

282
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,580
You must be craving alcohol. All right. Let's eat and get drunk.

283
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,890
I won't drink, since one of us has to drive.

284
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,220
It's all right. It's all right. There will be a substitute driver.

285
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,720
- A substitute driver?
- Or we can stay here for the night and then go.

286
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,250
Don't make me regret running all the way here, okay?

287
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,630
Is today the day when Seon Ho's energy explodes?

288
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,790
No, it's not.

289
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,290
I'm not jealous of you guys at all.

290
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,100
Even if I could turn back time,

291
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,880
I'm not going to go back to your age.

292
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,100
Hey... that's a lie.

293
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,110
Why not?

294
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,090
Because I'm tired of it.

295
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,880
I don't know what was so great back then and what was so upsetting.

296
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,670
Now that I know everything,

297
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,800
it wasn't anything special—both love and friendship.

298
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,290
Come on, that's really sad.

299
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:41,150
It's not sad but being comfortable.

300
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,920
Oh.

301
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,730
- Kang Seon Ho.
- Yes.

302
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,860
How did you first meet Yu Dong Man?

303
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,300
You already knew each other at your interview.

304
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,180
That's right. I was also curious about that.

305
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,820
At first, we had a conflict.

306
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,420
When he came to arrest me,

307
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,510
I thought my life was over just like that.

308
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,760
Arrest you? You?

309
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,360
Why? Professor Yu?

310
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,170
Choi Hui Su!

311
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,840
This place is so far!!

312
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,960
He's here! The substitute driver is here!

313
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,210
Inspector Yu!

314
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,990
He's fully drunk again.

315
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,880
Professor!

316
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,530
Sit. Sit. Come here. Come here.

317
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,300
I have to

318
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,430
find a very important piece of evidence for the investigation!

319
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,930
What kind of obstruction is this? Seriously?

320
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,930
The investigation is over.

321
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,600
What do you keep looking for?

322
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,240
Why did you drink so much?

323
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,700
The ocean breeze was nice, and it was nice to see young, fresh youth.

324
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,660
Grilled clams are good. The person I wanted to see also came.

325
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,510
Are you usually like this?

326
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,830
Like what?

327
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:21,750
Are you usually the type to be straightforward?

328
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,850
It depends on who it is.

329
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,930
So... do you not like it?

330
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,910
Just sleep. Don't talk nonsense.

331
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,320
Let's listen to exciting music.

332
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,350
Why are you doing this? Seriously.

333
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,580
I should sleep. Sleep, sleep.

334
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,480
Seriously?

335
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,590
Where are you trying to sleep?

336
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,700
- I'm tired.
- Hold on.

337
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,280
Go over th-there. Go there.

338
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,720
It's comfortable here.

339
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,580
Let me lean on you. I'm tired.

340
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,070
Professor Choi...

341
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,490
Such a sight!

342
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,720
Seriously...

343
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,120
- Seon Ho!
- Oh!

344
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,100
Bro! What's this?

345
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,940
- Hey, Beom Tae. His body is weird.
- Why?

346
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,810
He must have worked out really hard.

347
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,180
Let's see!

348
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,230
- Stop it. Stop it!
- Whoa!

349
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,650
- I worked out!
- Me too!

350
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,760
- There's nothing.
- Nothing?

351
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,550
Well, I wrote a long letter and it might be funny if I do this,

352
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,780
but I made a promise

353
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,000
to come back with the students.

354
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,610
I'm in a position where I have to keep that promise, so that's why.

355
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not laughing because it's really funny.

356
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,620
Well, it's funny. It's funny.

357
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,960
Anyway, I'm really grateful that you

358
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,110
rejected my resignation letter.

359
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,270
To be honest, after reading your letter,

360
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,790
I had a lot of thoughts.

361
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,470
The word "teacher" in Hanja means

362
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,220
first to be born.

363
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,920
We're just people who are born first and live our lives first.

364
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,440
So that the students can follow along well, we live well first.

365
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,480
Also, if we pave the way for our students first,

366
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,050
then that's all you need.

367
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:12,390
And I will cut off those who make the path of the students very thorny.

368
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:17,010
Oh. We have the same thought on that.

369
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:24,960
So, this should be the last time you do such

370
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,570
dangerous things with the students.

371
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,890
How did you know that?

372
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,320
I heard it from Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil.

373
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,070
He called before his arrest.

374
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,080
Hey! Hey! Hey!

375
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,570
You guys! Did you guys hear that?

376
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,230
The person who arrested Professor Go.

377
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,480
Rumor has it that it was one of our professors.

378
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,300
- And?
- And?

379
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,540
There must be more.

380
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,520
- The police?
- No, no. Other than them.

381
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,920
Anyone else?

382
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,620
There wasn't anyone else.

383
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,340
- We decided to keep it a secret, right?
- You stay put for a while.

384
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,170
Anyone? Anyone? Wasn't there anyone else?

385
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,310
- No one.
- No, there must be.

386
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,260
There is no one else.

387
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,510
- There is.
- Ah no one else.

388
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,170
Attention everyone!

389
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,560
I'm sure you're well aware that you get new roommates every semester.

390
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,020
Your new roommates have been assigned already.

391
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,030
Everyone take out your phones.

392
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,810
Everyone check the homepage and

393
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,230
move your luggage. Do it.

394
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,380
Wow! Hey! Beom Tae.

395
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,860
- We are in the same room.
- What?!

396
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,420
We are in the same room this semester too.

397
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,220
Let's get along well this semester too.

398
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,970
Wow, cool.

399
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,520
Seon Ho. Who's your roommate?

400
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,200
It will be fine.

401
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,500
Min Gyu's personality is pricky, but...

402
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,160
he...

403
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,090
he...

404
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,750
- he is handsome, right?
- Of course.

405
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Min Gyu is absolutely handsome. Right?

406
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,150
Handsome.

407
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,910
Can you leave? The room is small so it's uncomfortable.

408
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,490
Oh, yes. Let's go out.

409
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,260
See you later.

410
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,380
Hey Park Min Gyu.

411
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,700
We have to use the same room throughout this semester,

412
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,050
and we can't change our roommates, so

413
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,820
let's get along well. Huh?

414
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,000
- You're still making promises you can't keep.
- What?

415
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Just take care of Kang Hui.

416
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Well, I don't know how long she will be with you though.

417
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,380
That jerk, seriously!

418
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,960
300 Euros

419
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,020
300 Euros?

420
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,380
300 Euros

421
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,670
A luxury brand? So annoying!

422
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,640
What is annoying?

423
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,730
What is that?

424
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,640
It's nothing.

425
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,240
Have you tried asking the administrator for a new room assignment?

426
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,660
She said to move out of the residence hall.

427
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,330
You'll have to keep to yourself then.

428
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:01,900
Still, I'll try to get along with Min Kyu.

429
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,310
You're kind, Kang Seon Ho.

430
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,730
I like Seon Ho, you like Kang Hui, right?

431
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,780
Sunbae.

432
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,990
How about we form an alliance?

433
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,440
Alliance?

434
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,630
I will help you and you will help me.

435
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,870
If it still doesn't work out, I'll cleanly give up.

436
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,240
Is this some type of sympathy?

437
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,670
Hey, that's a little disappointing to hear.

438
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:50,100
Let's say two heads are better than one.

439
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,330
Then, Sunbae...

440
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,050
What is that?

441
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,660
It's nothing.

442
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,790
What is that?

443
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,080
My boyfriend gave me this as a gift.

444
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,730
I see.

445
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,870
Do you really think you made the right decision?

446
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,610
What?

447
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,610
Professors and students arrested Professor Go.

448
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,800
You knew very well that everyone could get hurt.

449
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:30,150
That is why I was against your return to the school,

450
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,900
Eeven though Professor Seo Sang Hak, Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil, and Professor Choi Hui Su

451
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,600
all turned a blind eye.

452
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,230
Wait a moment.

453
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,450
How did you know that the arrest was made with the students?

454
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,140
I heard from Professor Seo Sang Hak

455
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,950
that Professor Gwon called.

456
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,210
What brings you here unannounced?

457
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:11,300
Why did you tell Professor Seo Sang Hak before the round-up?

458
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,590
Why are you asking so abruptly?

459
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,640
Information is key in cybercrime.

460
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,160
I'm asking what's your reason for telling everyone about it!

461
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,130
It was a mission undertaken along with the students.

462
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,230
In case of unforseen events,

463
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,740
I thought it was natural to tell the faculty head.

464
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,670
What is the problem exactly?

465
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,170
What are you suspecting again?

466
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,670
Why is the word suspecting coming from here?

467
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,880
Isn't this something I can just ask?

468
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,760
Did you "just ask" right now?

469
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,240
According to me, you

470
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,740
see and hear what you want to.

471
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,670
I know that you worked this investigation for a long time,

472
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,150
but it's all over now.

473
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:08,360
Let it go now. I am just worried about you.

474
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,980
Tomorrow is the opening

475
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,730
so eat something delicious today and vent a little.

476
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,790
Huh?

477
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,530
Did you eat?

478
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,550
Thank you.

479
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,490
Why jjokbal (pig's feet/trotters)?

480
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,340
You ate pork well.

481
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,380
That's not what I meant. I asked, why are we eating jjokbal suddenly.

482
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,640
Ah. Someone said that

483
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,730
I should eat something delicious and vent (my feelings) a little.

484
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,790
And now that I think of it,

485
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:16,130
I have never fed you a proper meal.

486
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,900
Why? We ate a lot of delivered food when we were investigating at night.

487
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,500
Did we?

488
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,400
Yes, it's even more deliciously chewy to eat it here.

489
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,350
Why is your face like that?

490
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,600
What is it? Tell me quickly.

491
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,410
Professor.

492
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:50,660
- Why?
- This is really about my friend.

493
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,880
He bought a present for his girlfriend.

494
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,630
A cheap but very pretty one.

495
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,400
But, at the same time, a guy who likes his girlfriend also bought a gift.

496
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,470
But that was a brand-name item, it seems.

497
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,710
Then the girlfriend would obviously like the

498
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,130
brand-name item, right?

499
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,270
Are you dumb?

500
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:24,030
Even if it's cheap, if the one you like gives you a present, you will be happy and like it.

501
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,550
But no matter how great a brand-name item, if a person you don't like gives it to you you would only think,

502
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,160
"Why are they giving such things to me?"

503
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,740
And, don't meet a b*tch who says she doesn't like you because you got her a cheap gift.

504
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,280
Why are you calling her a b*tch?

505
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,070
Why is your face like that?

506
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,390
This is really about my friend.

507
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,030
My friend told his friend

508
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,480
something that should be kept a secret no matter what.

509
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,070
He very earnestly begged me saying that it was something

510
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,450
that absolutely could not be leaked.

511
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:08,890
What if they then right away told someone that info?

512
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,730
Why do you think he did that?

513
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:14,820
Why are you even asking? It's because he is a bad person.

514
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,540
Why would you keep such a person as your friend, professor?

515
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,600
Why is a secret a secret?

516
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,510
I would never let such a loose-lipped person be my friend.

517
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,670
Just eat a lot of this jjokbal.

518
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,480
Boss, one bottle of beer and one bottle of soju.

519
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,970
Stop drinking.

520
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,520
I don't care. I'm going to drink.

521
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,290
He's day drinking quite a bit.

522
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,460
Where are you going?

523
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,910
To do some (useless) digging.

524
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,510
There's something. I'll tell you if I find it. Go inside.

525
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,690
Okay. Bye.

526
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,460
Man.

527
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:08,310
Stand up straight, kid. We have money and a place to live.

528
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,250
What are you saying?! Seriously!

529
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,930
What do you mean what am I saying?

530
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,780
Do well.

531
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:32,240
Even if it's cheap, if the one you like gives you a present, you will be happy and like it.

532
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,490
Kang Hui.

533
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,340
Where are you now?

534
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,010
You weren't at the dorms?

535
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,940
I went to eat with professor Yu Dong Man.

536
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,480
It's pretty, right?

537
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,080
Huh?

538
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,270
I like it very much.

539
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,410
What's wrong?

540
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:29,460
Oh, n-nothing. Isn't it t-time for the roll call?

541
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,340
There's no one here. Let's go.

542
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,950
Okay.

543
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,650
It's not here either.

544
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,680
Where is it?

545
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,170
Wait a moment.

546
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,200
Go Deok Bae this b*stard.

547
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,380
This son of a gun.

548
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,740
Is this out of charge?

549
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,530
I know that you worked this investigation for a long time,

550
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,920
but it's all over now.

551
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,330
Team Leader

552
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,610
Yes, it's me. Are you at the station now?

553
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,480
Go Deok Bae, you are dead meat now.

554
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,520
Ah, wait a moment.

555
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,880
- I have something to ask.
- Professor Choi?

556
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,290
I came to meet the chief of investigations, Han Jeong Sik.

557
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:50,090
At the end of the hallway, to the right.

558
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,930
Thank you.

559
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,750
Aigoo, this jerk.

560
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,830
He said it was important evidence.

561
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,030
010-0777-4940

562
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,440
The website will be open at 9 p.m. today.

563
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,470
Then I can go to one place and professor Choi can go to the other.

564
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:11,170
I think they know we are hacking them.

565
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,780
There's no way it would have leaked.

566
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,670
The phone is turned off.

567
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,660
Please call again at another time.

568
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,920
Constitutional law class in the second semester...

569
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,190
I know. We're only halfway done.

570
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:57,310
I think it's going to be intense.

571
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,980
Savages! You don't even know the first thing about the law!

572
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,390
Be the bigger person. In Article 21 of the Constitution,

573
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,980
even those losers have the right to express themselves.

574
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,000
As preliminary law majors, we should hold back.

575
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,940
Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil ❤️

576
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,280
What exactly is that?

577
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,300
Jun Wuk, let's also go to class.

578
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,330
You don't even know.

579
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,010
Let's go. Let's go.

580
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:33,310
No. I saw it clearly.

581
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,580
You don't have class today, right?

582
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

583
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:00,520
You must have been busy. Should I not have asked you out today?

584
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,590
It's okay. Judo class starts tomorrow.

585
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:10,320
You said that Gossi Beer opened here after you came to the Police University, right?

586
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,440
It was around three years after I got transferred here.

587
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,700
Then you must have known Go Deok Bae for a long time.

588
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,630
Were you close?

589
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:24,770
What's there to be close for? He's just a manager of a bar and I was a customer.

590
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:28,640
Right. You don't know him well, right?

591
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,670
Of course, I don't know him well.

592
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,620
But why did you

593
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,240
go to the Seoul police station yesterday?

594
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,160
I thought I saw someone like you.

595
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,210
Is it common to find a person as pretty as me? Right, It was me.

596
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,680
I went to meet a friend.

597
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:57,620
I came to see the chief of investigations, Han Jeong Sik.

598
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,070
Was it two years ago?

599
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:09,850
A professor who used to work at the Police University transferred to that police station.

600
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:14,510
She's a female policewoman. She sent a wedding invitation saying she was getting married but I thought I wouldn't be able to go, so

601
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,940
I stopped by to drop off the congratulatory gift.

602
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,280
Aren't you getting in?

603
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,800
Yes, I am.

604
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,880
There is a phrase that states the crime can only be acknowledged

605
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,910
when there's a degree of proof without reasonable doubt.

606
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:49,560
The police rule states that the cause of death

607
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,860
and the details of death should be investigated until

608
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,160
reasonable doubts about the crime are excluded.

609
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,380
In these two phrases, reasonable doubt is being used differently.

610
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,990
"Reasonable suspicion." The suspicion that someone might be guilty.

611
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,640
And "reasonable doubt."

612
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,060
The doubt that someone might not be guilty.

613
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:15,140
You could say that the latter leads to the presumption of innocence.

614
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,740
According to the judicial precedent, our Supreme Court

615
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,600
uses the proof of suspicion under British-American law.

616
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,270
and uses under German law,

617
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:26,990
proof and probability for the court to reach the verdict with certainty.

618
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:31,380
Those are the standards used by the Supreme Court.

619
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,900
Kang Hui.

620
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:40,160
- If you are okay, see me for a moment.
- Hmmm.

621
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,130
I think I made a mistake

622
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,330
last time because

623
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,800
I was very angry, sorry.

624
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,310
It's okay. It's all in the past.

625
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,260
Ah, I heard they're going to give your mom a retrial.

626
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,590
Yes.

627
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,460
That is why,

628
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,410
if there's something you don't know while preparing, I want to help.

629
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:16,110
I can do that, right?

630
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,830
I would be grateful.

631
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,000
♫  I will remember ♫

632

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,150
Kang Hui. Kang Hui.

634
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,010
- Huh?
- Are you listening?

635
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,020
Sorry, what did you say?

636
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,990
I said I am grateful too.

637
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:10,420
I thought you wouldn't wear that.

638
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,100
- Huh?
- Huh?

639
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:20,550
The bracelet I gave you as a present, didn't Na Rae tell you?

♫ Even the image of you hugging me who was crying ♫

646
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,390
♫ remains. ♫

647
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:57,030
Kang Hui.

648
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,940
What are you doing?

649
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,390
That bracelet.

650
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,640
You should have told me that it wasn't you and that you didn't like it.

651
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,780
I thought you gave it to me.

652
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,630
How could you not tell me after seeing that?

653
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:14,150
Do you think I didn't tell you because I was happy about it?

654
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,570
I also didn't like it and felt bad.

655
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:18,910
But how can I always do as I feel?

656
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,520
You...

657
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,150
You liked it.

658
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:28,180
But, why would you hold back for things like this?

659
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,200
Are you really my boyfriend?

660
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,650
Ah, I don't know. Let's stop.

661
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,300
Okay, then. I'll do as I feel now.

662
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,460
Don't wear the bracelet that Park Min Gyu gave you.

663
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,920
And,

664
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,780
from now on wear only this.

665
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,920
This is...

666
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,690
You were looking at this at the beach.

667
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,420
♫ Truly, I wanna know, I wanna know what's on my mind ♫

668
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,020
It's not expensive or

669
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,320
anything good.

670
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,780
I get it so just put it on me already.

671
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,080
♫ you're dazzling like a shining star ♫

672
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:36,650
♫ When I see you, I'm filled with the thoughts of you.
 ♫

673
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:41,740
♫ The place you and I are going to look toward is the same ♫

674
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,070
♫ We are going to dream the same dream again. Can you feel it? ♫

675
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:50,580
♫ That's whatI want to say only to you
 ♫

676
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:55,960
♫ That's what I still must hear only from you (Still me)
 ♫

677
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,260
♫ Love isn't a big deal
 ♫

678
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,960
The red coral

679
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,030
blocks misfortune and brings happiness.

680
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:10,250
But, I will block all your misfortune.

681
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,470
So all you have to do is wait for happiness.

682
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,560
You selected a bracelet just like you.

683
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:23,540
I like it very much.

684
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:28,430
♫ Well, if you want to know, Get Ready ♫

685
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,200
It's prettier than Park Min Gyu's, right?

686
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,920
Of course, why did you even bother asking that?

687
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,870
Really?

688
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,020
It's not that cheap.

689
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,740
How much is it?

690
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,970
- I don't know.
- Hmmm. You don't need to know.

691
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,390
Mentor.

692
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,550
Are you okay?

693
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,920
Sorry.

694
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:32,150
It's okay if you know it.

695
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,840
But now I am at peace.

696
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,540
I don't have to lie anymore.

697
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,890
You ended everything, right?

698
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,280
Crazy jerk, what nonsense are you saying?

699
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,060
Your mother

700
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,280
cried a lot.

701
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,150
You committed a crime,

702
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,060
but it's okay if you reflect on your mistakes and pay for your crimes.

703
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,830
Don't stay away from your family.

704
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,660
I came to say that, you jerk.

705
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,240
You also don't come here anymore, Mentor.

706
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:33,130
I'll accept all the penalties for my crimes

707
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,640
and then we shall meet again.

708
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,820
Then,

709
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:42,090
I'll tell you why I did all these things.

710
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,520
And don't get hurt.

711
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,810
Cheol Jin.

712
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,860
Let me ask you just one thing.

713
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,540
Is Go Deok Bae

714
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,950
really the end?

715
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,980
Professor, are you in your room?

716
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,690
My roommate monitors me heavily.

717
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:33,820
That's why I'm telling you through chat instead of meeting you.

718
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,260
Anyway, you were right, Professor.

719
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:41,970
Just as you said, the important thing about a gift

720
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,800
is who gives it.

721
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,560
Stranger: You're finally here.

722
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,180
Yoon.

723
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,940
Stranger: Oh my. You aren't Yoon.

724
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:08,210
You are Kang Seon Ho, right?

725
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,010
Is Go Deok Bae

726
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,770
really the end?

727
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,930
Then and now,

728
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:31,710
there's only one thing I can tell you.

729
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:35,280
The culprit is in Police University.

730
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,490
I don't know anything other than that, Mentor.

731
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:44,800
So, this should be the last time

732
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,480
you do such dangerous things with the students.

733
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,690
It was something we did with the students.

734
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,740
In preparation of something unexpected happeneing,

735
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,350
I thought it was right for me to tell Professor of Public Administration.

736
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,700
Why did you come to the Seoul Police station yesterday?

737
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,040
She's a female lieutenant.

738
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,320
She sent a wedding invite, but I don't think I can go that day,

739
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,890
so I stopped by to give the congratulatory money.

740
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:42,800
But how can a hacker end up in Police University?

741
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,450
What is this?

742
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,060
Open Folder

743
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,700
Who are you?

744
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,760
Protocol of Examination of a Suspect

745
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:53,630
Personal Statement

746
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:58,030
- Name? Age?
- Kang Seon Ho. Nineteen years old.

747
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:00,460
You are a high school student.

748
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,450
- Your address.
- Seoul,

749
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:06,120
37-1 Namyang-dong, Jongro-gu.

750
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,300
The officer who turned a blind eye to hacker Kang Seon Ho was

751
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,470
Yu Dong Man.

752
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:20,030
Yu Dong Man.

753
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,710
Stranger

754
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:23,920
Is it thanks to this person?

755
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,610
Who the hell are you?!

756
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,890
♫ When things don't go as they should, tell me ♫

757
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:51,270
♫ When you feel like you are falling, hold me ♫
♫ Hey yeah yeah yeah ♫

758
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,930
♫ When everyone leaves you, tell me. ♫

759
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:04,180
♫ I'll be there for you. Hold me. ♫
♫ Hey yeah yeah yeah ♫

760
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,000
Police University
~Preview~

761
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,890
Was it Kang Seon Ho?

762
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,680
That student seemed fun.

763
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,980
I guess you favor him.

764
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,300
I don't think the illegal gambling website case is over yet.

765
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,220
Answer me honestly. Is there something that I need to know?

766
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,920
Do just one thing that I order you to.

767
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,170
There won't be any problem, right? Everything will be fine, right?

768
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:32,470
Whether you will hold my hands and survive,

769
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,400
or you'll fall off the cliff with Yu Dong Man.

770
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,630
You decide, Kang Seon Ho.
