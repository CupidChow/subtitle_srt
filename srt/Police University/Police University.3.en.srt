1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,290
Episode 3

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,320
If chances are given to those who deserve it,

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,050
then I will try to win first place for the 3rd cadet squad in the last training session.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,770
If I can't deliver then as well, I'll leave on my own

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,320
without saying anything.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,680
So could you decide after the training is finished

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,490
whether or not I'm allowed to stay at this school?

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,490
What the heck did you say, you crazy bastard?

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,360
Are you okay?

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,790
Look at your sweat...

11
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,610
If I only hadn't suggested eating ramen...

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,320
- I am sorry, Bro.
- When you said not to eat,

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,300
we should have listened to you.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,120
You shouldn't have waited up for me.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,130
How could we after hearing that?

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,870
- Heard what?
- We didn't hear all of it but

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,110
the part where you said you'd make our squad come in first place.

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:21,480
- Seon Ho, you applied to other colleges besides here, right?
- Hey!

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,350
Why would Seon Ho go to a different college? You're so...

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,200
Does itmake sense

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,970
that we would suddenly be in first place?

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,670
List of Admissions

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,670
Father: Kang Dong Yeong (Deceased) Mother: Han Yeong Seon (Deceased)
Guardian: Yun Taek Il.

24
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,590
I was wondering why his ID was 'Yoon.'

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,820
You can't even repay him for raising you. You pathetic bastards.

26
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,390
One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four!

27
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,370
- One.
- Three.

28
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,970
- Two.
- Four.

29
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,910
- Three!
- One, two, three, four!

30
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,890
So far, seven voluntary withdrawals. Three expulsions.

31
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,140
The current number of people is sixty.

32
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,980
One week of the Cheongram training remains.

33
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,620
The top-ranking squad, up to now, is the 2nd squad.

34
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,140
Applause.

35
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,800
The 2nd squad, led by leader Oh Kang Hui, is exempt from the final exercise.

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,850
In the final exercise, the 1st squad, led by Park Min Gyu,

37
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,050
and the 3rd squad, led by Kang Seon Ho, will face off.

38
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,990
Then I'll announce the final training.

39
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,430
From over there... this way.

40
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,500
From over there—

41
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,130
Extremely Advanced Scientific Training!

42
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,610
- Think of it as paintball survival.
- Over here pew! Over there, pew!

43
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,530
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Don't let my enemies know about my death.

44
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,050
Dividing the squads into ally and enemy squads.

45
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,250
- One side is attacking.
- Attack!

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,070
The other side is practicing defense. It's basic military training.

47
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,940
- Cheongram training is a shortened version of the Army Corps Training program, and we do it, too.
- You're talking about over there?

48
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,570
I heard that Cheongram training produces the largest number of students who fail. No way.

49
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,830
But we're not going to fail, are we?

50
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,440
The squad's strategy, resourcefulness,

51
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,720
and planning are very important if we don't want to fail.

52
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,690
Seon Ho, we'll be okay, right?

53
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,530
Is it okay with you?

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,930
So, what are you going to do with Kang Seon Ho now?

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,950
I know. What do I do?

56
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,150
What are you thinking about? Are you really not coming back?

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,650
I know. How do I go back?

58
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,060
I mean, just forget it, and just like before, get help from Yoon.

59
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,640
What about Kang Seon Ho?

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,740
I saw who Kang Seon Ho was.

61
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,020
Wow... Seriously! What's wrong with you?

62
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,080
When it comes to nabbing criminals, you aren't picky about the details.

63
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,110
Leave. Get lost!

64
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,450
Then put all the illegal gambling sites down for now,

65
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:59,100
and just apologize to the team leader. If you do that, then I... well... will do it with you.

66
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,360
Leave! I said leave!

67
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,510
Get lost! I said get lost!

68
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,500
I will leave after I finish eating this.

69
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,110
Jeez.

70
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,600
But you're already having a strategy meeting?

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,470
Yes.

72
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,710
Like you said, I'm trying to do my best,

73
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,730
regardless of whether I'm good or not

74
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,840
because it's my last chance.

75
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,780
That's a good idea. Do whatever you want to do,

76
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,530
without any regrets.

77
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,690
This moment only comes once.

78
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,470
I'm going to do what I want, without any regrets.

79
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,850
Hey, Oh Kang Hui!

80
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,300
What? Why are you laughing?

81
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,580
You said something similar to someone I like.

82
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,100
Who?

83
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,570
What?

84
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,930
Who is the person you like?

85
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,190
Oh... that...

86
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,570
That is ...

87
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,210
No, forget it. What's the point of me knowing?

88
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,200
I just made assumptions by myself again.

89
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,840
I mean, I was just wondering. Your dream to be a cop or whatever was all a lie.

90
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,350
But you don't seem like that these days.

91
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,720
Among everyone who entered this school, you're working the hardest.

92
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:42,410
I will apologize for making that assumption when we are officially admitted to the university.

93
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,740
I will

94
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,920
also tell you who it is when I'm officially admitted into the school.

95
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,570
Hey, you can't go back on your word.

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,170
Then I guess I will have to start rooting for your squad.

97
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,800
Then I guess I will have to start rooting for your squad.

98
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,870
I can't leave this school!

99
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,580
I will definitely pass!

100
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,970
Hey, everyone!

101
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,740
Hey, everyone.

102
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,900
Hey, everyone! Attention!

103
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,090
All of you give me some ideas.

104
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,870
Usually, you can get something by throwing out ideas.

105
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,360
That is ...

106
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,930
All of a sudden?

107
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,460
I mean, just anything.

108
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,320
It could be anything. Whatever it may be.

109
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,550
Isn't that the job of the leader? If you're going to do this, why is there a leader?

110
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,470
Ah... Hey, Seon Ho is trying to show teamwork.

111
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,730
Teamwork! Teamwork! Yes!

112
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,230
I'm sure we'll lose anyway.

113
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,170
What kind of strategy meeting is this?

114
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,190
Hey. Hey. Seong Su, why are you being like this?

115
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,690
Let go of me.

116
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,880
Honestly, do you think we're going to beat Min Gyu's team?

117
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,130
They're the strongest team.

118
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,410
You tell me, am I wrong?

119
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,840
I wish someone would give me a tip at a time like this.

120
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,170
Why don't you go see Professor Yu Dong Man?

121
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,380
He's still a training instructor.

122
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,030
Besides, since you know each other,

123
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,120
wouldn't he give you any tips?

124
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,170
Let's meet up. It's because I have something to talk to you about.

125
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,680
Forget it. He's leaving anyway.

126
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,650
Just close you eyes
Team Leader

127
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,580
if you apologize just once.

128
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,310
Seriously?! Even if I apologize,

129
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,210
I'll have to have some kind of evidence to do it!

130
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,140
Ah! Seriously! It'll make me look bad.

131
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,530
What is it?

132
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,300
I am here to tell you something.

133
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,460
I told you that I would win first place,

134
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,980
but could you help me out a little?

135
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,130
What?!

136
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,190
I really want to go to this school.

137
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,420
I don't want to leave like this.

138
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,900
So, that's why I really want to come in, first place,

139
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,230
but can't you help me a little?

140
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,070
D-D-Don't come here.

141
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,870
Excuse me?

142
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,810
St-Stand there and tell me. Right there.

143
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,690
Like you said, so that I can live paying my father back.

144
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,750
So that I can hang in there with my own strength.

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,500
Please help me out a little, Professor.

146
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,460
I'm begging you.

147
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,000
- Professor...
- Hey! Hey!

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,810
I understand, so don't come any closer!

149
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,330
You just said you understand, right?

150
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,500
This nonsense really gives me a headache.

151
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,180
I can do anything if you'll help me!

152
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,690
I'll do anything you tell me to do.

153
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,040
What's the problem?

154
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,310
I'm not sure what to do to prepare for the last exercise.

155
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,840
I can't get a good feel for it.

156
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,520
What's the problem?

157
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,580
This is so frustrating.

158
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,880
There is only one destination and the route is obvious.

159
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,150
Does it make sense that you can't come up with a strategy for something so obvious?

160
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,080
After graduating from the academy,

161
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,620
is that something that the SWAT leader can say?

162
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,950
Wait. Are you really saying you'll help me?

163
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,610
No. It's not that.

164
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,050
Then I'll be back around lunchtime tomorrow!

165
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,410
See you tomorrow! Thank you!

166
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,790
Hey! Hey!

167
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,850
Thank you so much.

168
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,630
That crazy...

169
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,840
A bastard who can't even formulate a plan properly! Why is he even at the police academy?

170
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,310
Battle strategy

171
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,340
I don't know either.

172
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,650
Why is there so much?

173
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,850
Hey ace! Are preparations going well?

174
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,120
I'll just do what I always do.

175
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,460
You are saying that winning will be easy, right?

176
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,160
I mean that I'll just keep doing my best.

177
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,040
That's what would be respectful to my opponent.

178
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,840
He's cool.

179
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,660
- I can do it.
- Where do I go?
- You can just go over there.

180
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,900
Are you having trouble sleeping by any chance?

181
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,150
No.

182
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,720
Oh. Okay.

183
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,030
The advice I can give to your squad is...

184
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:37,190
But why should I be helping your squad?

185
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,730
Because I'm not the only one who has to succeed in this last exercise.

186
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,290
All of squad three has to pass.

187
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,310
Punk. Don't you have anything better to do than sell off your teammates?

188
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,410
I have to do what I have to do.

189
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,390
Because there is no next time for me.

190
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,700
Even if you go that far, it won't work, punk.

191
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,930
Is a team of idiots, a selling team?

192
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,370
What do you mean by that?

193
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,820
Before you make a strategy, figure out your team of idiots first.

194
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,450
There is no solution because losers are looking for a way to win.

195
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,760
Why? Are you disappointed because there isn't a specific trick?

196
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,690
No, I'm not.

197
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,120
Miracles. Reversals. If you want things like that, you should wake up.

198
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,890
Shouldn't you be reasonable?

199
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,520
There isn't a next time for you.

200
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,130
Miracles, reversals, dreams. Is it wrong to believe in them?

201
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,050
You don't have to talk so long just to say that we'll fail.

202
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,790
Whatever, whatever. He probably understood.

203
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,820
Why? You still don't understand?

204
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,550
What?

205
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,120
I was wondering how I would do it alone. Thanks!

206
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,320
- But are you having trouble sleeping?
- No.

207
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,290
I saw your light on last night.

208
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,620
Why were you looking at my room at night?

209
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,900
What a dangerous woman.

210
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,930
There are only two reasons I can't sleep.

211
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,360
When I'm stressed or lonely.

212
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,530
The solution to both problems is the same. Just do what your heart wants to do.

213
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:59,110
What's up with this lady?

214
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,860
Excuse me.

215
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,240
What a weird woman.

216
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,760
"Listen to my heart"?

217
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,140
Ugh. I don't know.

218
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,140
Let me just go to sleep.

219
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,390
Let me sleep!

220
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,230
Hyung, is something wrong?

221
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,250
I haven't been able to log in for a while because I had some things happening in my life.

222
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,120
I wanted to meet you, though.

223
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,910
Hyung. Hyung!

224
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,490
Bird
Yoon

225
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,250
It's no big deal. Already resolved.

226
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,870
What a surprise. I'm glad.

227
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,560
Oh, right! Hyung! I got into the National Police University.

228
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,730
Ah, this punk, how could he keep calling me Hyung.

229
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:10,100
But I don't think I can go to college. It's not easy to hang on.

230
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,080
Are you giving up as soon as you celebrate?

231
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,960
I'm not giving up, but someone told me to give up.

232
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,800
He said someone who can't win is only looking for a way to win.

233
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,350
Ah, this punk.

234
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,200
Who is it? Are you sure that's what he said?

235
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,560
Is that really all he said?

236
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,930
Before you make a strategy, figure out your team of idiots first.

237
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,400
There is no solution because losers are looking for a way to win.

238
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,730
You're the one who is skilled online, aren't you?

239
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,530
Why are you so scared? It's not like you.

240
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,960
I believe you will do well.

241
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,380
I believe you will do well.

242
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,560
- Hey, guys. We're going to have a strategy meeting later, so gather everyone together.
- Oh!
- Oh!

243
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,960
Squad leader! Then do you have a strategy now?

244
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,650
Kang Seon Ho.

245
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,090
Let's play fair tomorrow so no one gets hurt.

246
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,940
Of course.

247
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:03,370
But Park Min Gyu. If you do as you always do, you won't win tomorrow's match.

248
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,880
Are you guys filming a health tonic commercial?

249
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,190
Everybody come out, the final exercise is beginning.

250
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,530
What?

251
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,840
Hey! What do we do?

252
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,860
- Ah!
- Seon Ho.

253
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,200
The exercise was supposed to be tomorrow night.

254
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,030
What going on all of the sudden?

255
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,370
All right. 1st squad and 3rd squad come forward.

256
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,880
The first team to pull out the flag in the opponent's base camp wins.

257
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,830
The time limit is one hour.

258
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,480
Keep in mind that more important than winning

259
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,190
- is that no one gets hurt.
- Yes, sir!

260
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,160
- All right, idiots. Depart!
- Depart!

261
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,880
- 1st squad, move!
- 3rd squad, follow me!
- Good luck.

262
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,770
- Yes, sir!

263
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,010
Hurry up!

264
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,900
Position

265
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,080
Camera setup complete.

266
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,270
Korean National Police University

267
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,610
Flagman, go up.

268
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,590
Stake the flag.

269
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,400
Seon Ho! What's your strategy? Just tell us.

270
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,350
First punch? Or raid them?

271
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,570
No. We are...

272
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:16,599
- All right, everyone assemble!
- Assemble!

273
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,699
- Assemble!
- Assemble!

274
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:21,619
Let's do a cheer.

275
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,729
- We are going to charge, no matter what.
- Let's finish this!

276
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:27,419
- 1st squad, fighting!
- Fighting!

277
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,829
We ...

278
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,409
are surrendering.

279
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:34,249
Wh-wh-what? Surrender? Hey, hey, we can't surrender.

280
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,569
What bullshit is that?!

281
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:41,649
- Just as I said, our strategy is to give up pulling out the flag.
- That's our strategy?

282
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:43,429
We have no chance of winning a direct frontal attack.

283
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:48,269
So, we're going to block the 1st squad from pulling out our flag, so no one can take it.

284
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:51,959
So, if at least one person from our squad survives to the end,

285
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:56,069
then we can pull out their flag.

286
00:21:56,069 --> 00:22:02,649
That's true, but wouldn't there be people at Min Gyu's base camp protecting the flag?

287
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:06,279
No. Almost everyone will come down.

288
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:10,809
To them, we are so weak, that they won't even protect their flag.

289
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:19,349
But we're not weak. We've all come this far as well.

290
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:22,669
So, guys, let's not be afraid.

291
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:24,569
I believe in you.

292
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:29,659
- Yes! It's not over until the match is over! Don't be afraid!
- Of course!

293
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:31,589
- Of course!
- We can do it!

294
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:32,599
3rd squad!

295
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,829
- We can do it!
- Yes!

296
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:36,049
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

297
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:37,669
Crazy... Seriously...?

298
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:40,349
Everyone quietly mark their spots.

299
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:44,329
When the 1st squad enters the inner area, that's when we take care of them.

300
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:01,369
The 1st unit, ready.

301
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:03,609
The 3rd unit, ready.

302
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:10,429
Could you decide after the training is finished

303
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:15,169
whether or not I'm allowed to stay at this school?

304
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,699
We're ready.

305
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,319
What kind of squad leader is that?

306
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,909
Surrender?! He's crazy.

307
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:45,039
So, what are you going to do?

308
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,499
If I go first and pull out the flag, it's over.

309
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:51,789
You can't! If we take off and leave our spot wide open, the rest of the team will get ambushed.

310
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:56,859
You're not coming?

311
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:02,049
Seong Su! I don't think this is right. Don't go. Don't go.

312
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,819
Don't come to me with regret when you're eliminated later.

313
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,539
Cowards.

314
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:22,899
Halt! Hang on, it's too quiet. It's a bit strange.

315
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:25,459
Looks like these jerks are scared.

316
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:28,709
Hey! Let's hurry up and finish this. Let's go!

317
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,789
Five eliminated from the 1st squad.

318
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:05,949
Eight eliminated from the 1st squad. Five eliminated from the 3rd squad.

319
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:09,359
What's gotten into that foolish captain?

320
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:21,309
Seon Ho, I think our strategy is working, just like you said.

321
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:25,519
- Hey! It looks like we're going to win.
- Yes!

322
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,219
Hey!

323
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:30,039
What's going on?

324
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,359
- Hey, he's in our squad!
- You suddenly came in.

325
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,259
Hey! But why are you here?

326
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:37,739
Seong Su went over there by himself, saying he was going to pull the flag out himself.

327
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:40,349
I tried to stop him, but... I'm sorry.

328
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:44,929
- What?!
- What?!
- What? Right now?!

329
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:47,059
Hey! Then you should have at least stayed there to guard!

330
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:51,459
Are you saying no one is over there at that guarding point?

331
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:54,089
What do we do squad leader?!

332
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,559
Seon Ho, what should we do?

333
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:04,319
What do we do?!

334
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,519
For now, we need to protect our flag, so let's go back to our base camp. I will cover you.

335
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,719
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Okay.

336
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,589
- Charge!
- Charge!

337
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,299
Seon Ho, what do we do?

338
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,729
Seon Ho! Squad— Squad leader!

339
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:53,229
I will try to win first place for the 3rd cadet squad in the last training session.

340
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:57,019
If I can't deliver then as well, then I'll leave on my own,

341
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,289
without saying anything.

342
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:03,499
Keep in mind that more important than winning,

343
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:05,289
is that no one gets hurt.

344
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:07,169
Seon Ho!

345
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:16,879
Kyung Hun, you go, 10 o'clock. You go, 2 o'clock.

346
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,609
You guys,

347
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,959
for now, the most important thing is not to get hurt. We're going to guard from here now.
- Okay.

348
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,389
Jun Wuk, you take 11 o'clock.
- 11 o'clock.

349
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:30,739
- Beom Tae, you take 3 o'clock.
- Okay.

350
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:43,499
Beom Tae, paint cartridge, the cartridge.

351
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:50,919
Beom Tae!

352
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,469
You guys!

353
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:04,639
- Are you guys okay?
- Seon Ho, it hurts.

354
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,729
- You did really well. Leave it to me now.
- We're counting on you.

355
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:11,279
- Everyone, charge!
- Charge!

356
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:26,539
- Four eliminated from the 3rd squad.
- Six eliminated from the 1st squad.

357
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:52,929
One eliminated from the 1st squad.

358
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:07,759
What happened?

359
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:14,969
First squad, entire squad elimination. Third squad, victory.

360
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:16,379
Third squad won?

361
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:20,179
♫ Fly away towards tomorrow now, ♫

362
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:23,829
♫ fly away high to the end. ♫

363
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:27,109
♫ The hot sun is not in the sky. ♫

364
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:28,399
♫ I found it (I found it) ♫

365
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,509
Wait a moment.

366
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:32,609
Wait, who was it that shot the paintball at the end?

367
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:35,319
Aigoo, 3rd squad won, Seon Ho!

368
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:38,009
- Yay!
- We won!

369
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:49,229
Hey!

370
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,319
Won't you jerks shut your mouths?!

371
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:37,639
Emergency Operating Room

372
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:42,189
Don't worry.

373
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,189
Please take care of him well.

374
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,969
What happened to Seong Su?

375
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:06,439
We have to wait for the results after the surgery is over.

376
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:10,469
- Hey—
- I will...

377
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,869
drop out of school.

378
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,599
What you said was correct.

379
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,839
I wasn't even qualified, but I hung on,

380
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:28,149
and got above myself and acted up...

381
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:31,229
Without even knowing my place.

382
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:35,789
I'm sorry.

383
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,849
Sit down.

384
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:43,709
Sit down so that I can see your leg.

385
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:50,409
When the nurse was using it,

386
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:54,139
I made a request to borrow it.

387
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,959
This kind of wound I can treat myself.

388
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,689
Wait a second.

389
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:11,059
Hey, are you okay?

390
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,689
Yes, sir.

391
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:23,649
Was it five years ago?

392
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:27,149
When I was arresting a pervert in Incheon,

393
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:33,259
I left my junior who was hurt and ran away as if my eyes were blinded.

394
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:37,059
I still regret it every day.

395
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:43,659
If I had my head on straight back then, that junior wouldn't have been stabbed with a knife.

396
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:52,459
Hey, after listening to this, don't just run looking forward.

397
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:55,519
Look behind too sometimes.

398
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,419
It's okay to make mistakes at school.

399
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:03,209
You just need to learn and not repeat those mistakes when you work.

400
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,759
And in today's training, there were no losers or winners.

401
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:23,119
Ambulance Entrance

402
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:37,499
This jerk understood what I said.

403
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:42,819
What is that jerk doing?

404
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:45,379
That is cheating!

405
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:06,569
Yes, this is Yu Dong Man.

406
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:13,799
Emergency Center 24 hours

407
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:23,489
Come on out, you jerks!

408
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,589
I'll kill you all!

409
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:29,299
- Sir!
- Hey!

410
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,379
Please put it down,

411
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,669
- What the hell did I do wrong?
- Put it down.

412
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:34,829
Why should I?

413
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:36,569
I am warning you, put that down.

414
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:39,359
You wish! No! I don't want to!

415
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,599
- Hey!
- Please calm down, sir.

416
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,039
I am going to cut myself, I really am.

417
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,469
Don't come!

418
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,899
Go away you b*stards.

419
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:59,299
- Get away quickly.
- Hey!

420
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:01,769
Hey, do you want to die?

421
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:03,649
Sir, you can't do this.

422
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:06,519
What do you mean I can't? What are you?

423
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,249
What do you mean by what?

424
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,089
He is a police officer who protects the citizens.

425
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:14,279
Goodness, that's dangerous

426
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,659
Why are you holding a kid like that?

427
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:20,349
Come here.

428
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:25,359
Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

429
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,519
This needs treatment before he gets arrested.

430
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:36,029
- Sir.
- Hmm.

431
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:41,899
Behave yourself and get treated. When you sober up a bit, we'll get your statement.

432
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,779
Sir, you are bad.

433
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:47,449
You are bad, not the alcohol.

434
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:52,019
But no matter how bad of a person you are, you have to get treatment if you are hurt.

435
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:54,819
That is what we police do.

436
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:58,319
From now, you will get treated silently. Okay?

437
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:00,039
Okay.

438
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,639
But,

439
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:07,859
who are you?

440
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,529
- Me?
- Yes.

441
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:16,179
- Professor at Police University.
- Ah!

442
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:19,049
And you?

443
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:25,659
He is... a freshman at Police University.

444
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:36,299
- Well done.
- How did he get him to calm down?

445
00:37:42,649 --> 00:37:44,899
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

446
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:58,489
- Are you okay, are you okay?
- Aigoo.

447
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:01,549
Look at all your expressions.

448
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,769
Did you all get scared?

449
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:07,859
The last session of Cheongram training was not a competition between the squads,

450
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:11,869
it was for us to see how much you trust your teammates and help each other.

451
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:15,689
It was a mess though.

452
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:19,789
Don't you ever forget today's session.

453
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:26,389
That is how you guys will become police officers who will protect at least one of your teammates when you work.

454
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:32,799
Starting now, I will watch you all carefully to see how you guys change from this mess.

455
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:34,119
- What?
- What's he saying?

456
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,379
Wait, what's going on?

457
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:42,649
You guys have passed, you jerks.

458
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:46,559
What? What? Yay!

459
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:59,059
Quiet!

460
00:39:00,259 --> 00:39:03,129
Hey, hey, hey!

461
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,119
You all have worked hard.

462
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,849
- You will have night snacks today.
- Night snacks!

463
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,579
Seon Ho, I'm really glad.

464
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,879
You worked hard Jun Wuk.

465
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:26,059
- Me too. Me too. Me too.
- Oh, yes.

466
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:28,369
Seon Ho, what about Seong Su. What happened?

467
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:32,149
The surgery went well. He will get discharged soon and will return to school.

468
00:39:32,149 --> 00:39:33,599
That's good!

469
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,859
We passed.

470
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:57,479
If I officially pass, I'll tell you.

471
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,889
Then I guess I have to start rooting for you, too.

472
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:17,129
Do you like it?

473
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:25,179
Congrats on passing. Let's get along well in the future.

474
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:30,659
Sure. Congrats to you too.

475
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:33,449
Oh. There was a misunderstanding back then right?

476
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:36,609
I want to apologize. I'm sorry.

477
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:39,899
It wasn't a misunderstanding.

478
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:45,239
I did come to this school because of you.

479
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:49,619
For you.
♫ Can you feel it? ♫

480
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:55,849
♫ The feelings. That's what I want to say only to you. ♫

481
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:01,449
♫ That's what I still must hear only from you (Still me) ♫

482
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:05,109
♫ It's not that so-called love is a big thing ♫

483
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:08,389
Squad leader!
♫ I'm going to take a step forward now feeling great ♫

484
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:10,589
I'm going to head out first.

485
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:13,979
♫ Get ready ♫

486
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:21,249
Hold on, Seon Ho.

487
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:28,879
I'll do my best moving forward. Congrats on your win today.

488
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:33,449
And in today's training, there were no losers or winners.

489
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:38,519
There were no losers or winners in today's match.

490
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,609
Congrats on passing.

The 41st Admissions Ceremony of the National Police University

492
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,220
Why are you this cool?

493
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,940
Excuse me, do you know where No Beom Tae is?

494
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,460
Are you Beom Tae's dad?

495
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,410
Hello! I'm Beom Tae's best friend Jo Jun Wuk.

496
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,550
Beom Tae!

497
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,170
- Your father is here!
- Dad!

498
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,150
This is my dad.

499
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,530
Congrats.

500
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,290
Father!

501
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,650
You're here.

502
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,750
Hold on a second, Father.

503
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:39,480
It really suits you.

504
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,020
My son is really cool.

505
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,980
You've worked hard, Seon Ho.

506
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,580
You've worked hard, Father.

507
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,370
We will be starting shortly.

508
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,910
Guests, please take your seats,

509
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,620
and new students, please stay in your seats.

510
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,000
I'll go sit over there, so go ahead.

511
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,640
Sure. I'll see you later, Father.

512

The 41st Admissions Ceremony of the National Police University

513
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,310
Back then, you came here because of what happened, right?

514
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,920
No! Well, it's not exactly that.

515
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,520
It's not enough to say I wouldn't be able to say anything even if I had ten mouths.

516
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,220
I saw Seon Ho's personal records.

517
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,700
You've gone through a lot.

518
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:51,530
An immature person can make a mistake. And I know he's doing well right now. It's okay.

519
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:57,090
And moving forward, I'll watch over him so that he can become a good police officer.

520
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,840
So rest assured.

521
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,760
Thank you, Detective. I mean, Professor.

522
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,020
Thank you so much.

523
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:13,300
I sincerely welcome the new class.

524
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,350
I sincerely hope for and support you in becoming police officers,

525
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:22,350
who combine legal and academic skills,

526
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:28,500
with the upright character and leadership to empathize and communicate with the public in the field of public safety.

527
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,870
Salute to the president of the university.

528
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,060
Salute to the president of the university!

529
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,540
Salute!

530
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,140
Salute!

531
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,650
- At ease!
- At ease!

532
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,080
The freshman oath!

533
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,560
I swear!

534
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,280
I swear!

535
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,160
As I enter the National Police University,

536
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,970
As I enter the National Police University,

537
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:05,010
I swear that I will abide by the school rules, have honor and pride as a National Police University student,

538
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,560
and earnestly apply myself to my studies by fulfilling my

539
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,380
responsibilities and duties.
- responsibilities and duties.

540
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,980
March 5, 2021. National Police University student,

541
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,610
- Kang Seon Ho.
- Oh Kang Hui.

542
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,220
Turn around!

543
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,590
Turn around!

544
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,130
Salute to your parents.

545
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,120
Salute to your parents!

546
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,410
Salute!

The 41st Admissions Ceremony of the National Police University

548
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,010
Yes, Detective.

549
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,200
Team Leader!

550
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,320
Oh! Who called that jerk?

551
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,000
Detective Jo!

552
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,630
I heard you caught those illegal gamblers.

553
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,800
But...

554
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,230
Did you capture a cryptocurrency exchange? Did you track the account?

555
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,360
Hey... hey... hey jerk. Hey! Yu Dong Man!

556
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:43,140
Team Leader! I definitely said that we have to catch that jerk.

557
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,400
You're not Chief Inspector Yu Dong Man from the criminal team,

558
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,700
but a professor from National Police University

559
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,240
which means this investigation is none of your business.

560
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,260
Forget it. It's fine if I just look into it, right?

561
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,450
Why are you being like this?

562
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:03,610
Of all the gambling groups, why the hell are you doing this, spending all your money, time, career,

563
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:07,120
and everything on them?

564
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:14,640
What do you mean by reason? Isn't it the job of the police to catch criminals?

565
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,010
- Detective!
- Where are you?

566
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,540
I don't think they're going to tell me about the investigation anymore,

567
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,050
so you tell me.

568
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,170
If you come back, then it will all works out.

569
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,840
You punk! It's because I can't come back.

570
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,290
- You mean you'll stay at the school?
- Yes.

571
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,850
- Are you going to get help from Hacker Yoon?
- No.

572
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,070
Why?

573
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:43,910
You punk, I taught you to abide by the rules, not to break the rules.

574
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:48,280
If you make that punk illegally hack again to catch our criminal,

575
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,630
then I'm the one who taught you incorrectly, aren't I?

576
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,600
There's nothing to worry about.

577
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,270
The location is the only thing that has changed. What those jerks are doing hasn't changed at all.

578
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,830
I'll catch them myself, and I'll be able to come back.

579
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:06,500
So, all you have to do is keep me posted on the illegal gambling investigation. Okay?

580
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,520
Easier said than done.

581
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,140
This jerk. Seriously...

582
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,500
I'm cutting you some slack, even if you mess with me,

583
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,120
because during that case with the creep, I left you and ran.

584
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,410
So.

585
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:32,240
At that time, you said you would always watch my back.

586
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,230
A year will go by quickly, you punk.

587
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,850
It still hurts a lot when it rains.

588
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,730
Even now, I turn around, scared that someone is standing behind me.

589
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:48,890
So, don't leave me alone.

590
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:53,160
Seriously, why are being like this? Are you already drunk?

591
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,200
Forget it. If you aren't there, all that's left is to die.

592
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,420
The way he's talking is so obnoxious.

593
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,980
Oh. Right. Your instinct was right.

594
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,900
Yesterday, I got a phone cal...

595
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,290
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

596
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,820
Caller ID Restricted.
Did you send Yu Dong Man, the one who was after us, here? Are we all going to die now?
Take care of Yu Dong Man by today.

597
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,240
You're being a little weird these days.

598
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,100
Is something going on?

599
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,880
Here.

600
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,480
This man is a detective, so make sure you don't speed.

601
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,190
Go ahead!

602
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,680
Caller ID Restricted

603
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,400
Yes.

604
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,710
Yes.

605
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,800
If we rush it, we might get into trouble.

606
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,160
Let's watch it a bit more.

607
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,860
Police University

608
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:37,540
The first class orientation is all of this week, so please prepare thoroughly, Professors.

609
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,490
Okay, I understand.

610
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,740
The first class is yours right, Professor Kwon?

611
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,170
Be gentle. Be gentle. Don't scare off the students right away.

612
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,170
Then, shall we end our meeting now?

613
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:51,400
Excuse me.

614
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,330
Yes, speak Professor Yu Dong Man.

615
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:57,580
What should we prepare for the orientation?

616
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:02,440
You can prepare your plans to teach the classes for the whole year.

617
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,370
Excuse me.

618
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,640
Yes.

619
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,970
When is my class?

620
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,510
The class schedule must have been sent to all the professor's mails already.

621
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,320
Ah, I haven't seen it.

622
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,550
Then, I'll get going.

623
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,140
Our Detective Yu is finally becoming Professor Yu.

624
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,030
Good morning!

625
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,620
Do well.

626
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,530
What?

627
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:47,740
I said, do well. I'm going to watch over you for a year.

628
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,720
Okay.

629
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,410
You are funny.

630
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,610
I will be in charge of your constitutional law class for the year. I am professor Gwon Hyeok Pil.

631
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:06,230
If you're tardy twice, you get an F. If you're absent once, you get an F.

632
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,200
You will also get an F if you fail to turn in an assignment.

633
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,700
There will never be any grade corrections.

634
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,410
If you get two "F" grades, you will be expelled from Police University.

635
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,490
Today's first OT class in law,

636
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:24,170
let's talk about police and the citizens.

637
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,780
In 2018, a case of industrial union protests.

638
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:31,560
In 2018, there was an industrial union protest.

639
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,580
Does anyone know about this?

640
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,680
After a long standoff between the police and protestors, four protestors were injured and

641
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,510
all were arrested.

642
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:49,620
It was a case with heavy criticism, saying that the police were overly repressive

643
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,330
and abused power against innocent citizens.

644
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:55,120
It was a very famous case.

645
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,710
Anyone who can explain it further?

646
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,790
It was a surprise protest that was not agreed upon in advance,

647
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,230
and they refused to disband after the police ordered them to disperse three times.

648
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,640
The protestors' actions threatened public order,

649
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,250
so I think the police responded appropriately under the law.

650
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,430
Good. Any different opinion?

651
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:28,490
Kang Seon Ho tell us about it.

652
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,440
Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

653
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,380
This needs treatment before he gets arrested.

654
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:50,400
I think that it was more important to protect them rather than to suppress or arrest them.

655
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,990
The protestors are also citizens we must protect.

656
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:01,090
Is that so? Then taking this case as an example,

657
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:05,500
a police car carrying the arrested murderer was involved in a car accident.

658
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:11,110
The killer was in critical condition and eventually died.

659
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:15,950
The murderer's family filed for government compensation, saying that it was an accident during official duties,

660
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:21,000
and eventually a judge ordered the payment of compensation.

661
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,140
The right to prosecute the murderer came to an end.

662
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:30,970
In this case, the police officer who caused the accident gave up his uniform and was even punished.

663
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:36,190
Who do you think protected you, Kang Seon Ho?

664
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,710
The criminal? The police?

665
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:42,300
The victims' families, whose right to prosecute was over?

666
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,480
- That is—
- No.

667
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,250
Kang Seon Ho, answer me.

668
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,010
That is...

669
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:01,140
I think you answered that we have to protect everyone because we are police.

670
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,130
Did you enter this Police University without even thinking about it?

671
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,320
Or do you have no thoughts?

672
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,260
Answer.

673
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,090
I'm sorry. I'm not sure.

674
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:24,260
I won't allow it in my class from now on.

675
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,510
Not answering and

676
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,250
answering without supporting evidence.

677
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,220
Class over.

678
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,250
Seon Ho, are you okay?

679
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,690
This professor is too strict.

Yes, this is Yu Dong Man.

I am Chief Han Jeong Sik.

687
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,690
Why don't you cancel the orders to go to the National Police University

688
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,300
and go to Seocho station, instead?

689
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,730
They are asking to recruit someone strong there.

690
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:23,450
Why?

691
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,940
Chief Han Jeong Sik

692
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:28,920
Team leader Choi requested it of me.

693
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,670
Team leader Choi: There is no way we will call you back, so stop calling me.

694
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:36,220
There is definitely something going on.

695
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,580
There is... ah!

696
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,390
But what is it?

697
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:48,610
Professor Yu Dong Man

698
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,760
That rude jerk.

699
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,020
He said it hurts where he got stabbed when it rains.

700
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,220
Did you send Yu Dong Man, the one who was after us, here? Are we all going to die now?
Take care of Yu Dong Man by today.

701
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:02,460
If you can't stop Yu Dong Man, know that it will be your end.

Incoming Call: My One and Only Mentor

703
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,620
My One and Only Mentor

704
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,050
Why are you calling me?

705
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,410
You rude jerk.

706
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,950
Hey. It's raining, you want to have samgyeopsal (3-layer pork belly)?

707
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:25,930
What does rain have to do with samgyeopsal?

708
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,520
Why don't I care?

709
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,010
When life is a mess, you go to eat pork belly!

710
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,970
Mentor?

711
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:40,730
What? Why are calling me like that? What's wrong?

712
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,740
You aren't going to give up, right?

713
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:47,100
What? Hey! Speak in a way that I can understand.

714
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:53,030
- You really aren't going to give up chasing those guys, right?
- Ah!

715
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:56,030
Hey, you bastard. How long have you known me?

716
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,580
Where are you?

717
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,990
Did you drink? Shall I pick you up?

718
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,960
The ones that you are after, from the gambling site,

719
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,090
they're at the National Police University–

720
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,300
Hey– Cheol Jin.

721
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,230
Cheol Jin. Park Cheol Jin!

722
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,220
Cheol Jin!

723
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:38,410

724
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,400
Need to protect everyone.

I'll do it right away, sir.

- Kang Seon Ho.
- Yes?

733
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,940
You told me you would do anything if I helped you?

734
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,020
- Help me.
- What?

735
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:35,400
Help me catch those jerks.

736
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:37,760
What are you saying—

737
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,460
With your hacking skills, we can catch those guys.

♫ fly away high to the end. ♫

People hang out with people who are like them.

Kang Hui's mom has been convicted four times, it seems.

756
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,960
How can a criminal's daughter be a police officer?

The guys related to the online illegal gambling site,

they seem to be at Police University.

759

This is your last warning. Get out of this school quietly.

760

He will come back to his senses, right?

761

We can't guarantee it.

If I help you, will that be legal?

You f*cking b*stards.

764
