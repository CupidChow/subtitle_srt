Episode 6

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,010
Oh god!

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,040
Kang Hui!

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,910
Be quiet.

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,680
Oh!
Student ID Card Oh Kang Hui

00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,670
Kang Hui

7
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,910
Hey, hey, hey. Should I really not answer it?

8
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,560
You punk!

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,420
It's loyalty and friendship not to answer.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,420
I know this best.

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,510
But what time is it now?

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,900
- It's 1 a.m.
- What?!

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,590
- What?! If they get caught outside ...
- They'll get severely punished!

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,530
Ah! Damn it!

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,170
I can't breathe.

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,650
Dammit.

17
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,230
- Kang Hui!
- Be quiet!

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,380
Oh Kang Hui! Oh Kang Hui!

19
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,470
Oh ... Kang ... Hui!

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,620
Oh Kang Hui! Oh Kang Hui! Oh Kang Hui!

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,660
- Expelled from school immediately!
- Oh Kang Hui!

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,110
- Expelled from school immediately!
- Oh ... !

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,470
- Expelled! You are expelled!
- Oh ....

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,640
- Oh Kang Hui, you are expelled!
- Oh ...

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,300
♫ When I see you, time stops ♫

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:07,560
♫ I am helpless. ♫

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,700
♫ Everything in the world just stops ♫

28
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:22,330
♫ Love is a moving thing going to you. ♫

29
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:32,070
♫ If a person whom I don't even know ♫

30
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:39,270
♫ asks how I feel ♫

31
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:46,470
♫ Yes, I'll stay with you now ♫

33
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:06,250
♫ Because you will be my last love ♫

34
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,520
Hey! Hey, Kang Seon Ho! Please wake up!

35
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,330
Get a hold of yourself. What do I do?

36
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,530
Who's on duty? Where did they all go? My goodness.

37
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,370
This is so frustrating.

38
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,990
Officer Nam! Officer Nam!

39
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,600
Salute! Officer Nam Hyeon Tae reporting.

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,110
How many officers are on guard right now?

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,910
Do you have to count that?

42
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,380
- How many? Hurry up and tell me. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
- There are five guards.

43
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,570
Gather them all here. I think a rat came in.

44
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,390
What the hell is going on in the middle of the night?

45
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,220
Why not? Last year, I heard that a 3rd year

46
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,390
brought her boyfriend in

47
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,790
and got caught by the administrator and both of them were expelled.

48
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,730
What about Oh Kang Hui? Why isn't she coming out?

49
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,450
She ... She just went to the bathroom.

50
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,110
National Police University Dormitory

51
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,200
Beom Tae, you go first ...

52
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,010
Okay. You're going to go up first, right?

53
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,940
That's right. I will watch your back.

54
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,050
When you go first, I will watch your back.

55
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,580
Okay ...

56
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,800
Nice.

57
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,240
- I told you to go first!
- Be quiet!

58
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,650
You said you'd go first!

59
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,780
I told you to go first!

60
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,520
- We're screwed.
- We're screwed.

61
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,210
Those rats.

62
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,380
No matter what comes out of here, you can't miss a single one. Do you understand?

63
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,650
Yes, ma'am.

64
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,600
Excuse me, Administrator!

65
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,810
- What is it?
- I have something to tell you.

66
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,570
All right, tell me later.

67
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,150
Open it.

68
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,810
I think that roll call and inspection of the dormitory at this time of night is a violation of human rights!

69
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,710
If you really don't want to be violated, go back to your room immediately.

70
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,730
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and open it.

71
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,790
You need to treat the students with the right to self-determine as individuals—

72
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,100
Kang Hui, I really did my best.

73
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,130
Hurry up and open it!

74
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,370
Park Min Gyu ... how did you ...

75
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,960
Professor Choi.

76
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,670
- Administrator.
- What are you doing in here right now?!

77
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,030
I mean, can't you give me a room in the dormitory, as well?

78
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,580
I want to get some energy from the young people, too.

79
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,490
I want to feel the emotions of the young people.

80
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,920
If you're drunk, you should go to your own employee housing.

81
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,140
Every time. Every time. Every time.

82
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,860
Why the hell do you do this every time?

83
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,510
That's right! I have my own housing.

84
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,970
But there is no man there. I want to live in the dormitory, too!

85
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,260
But there is no room here.

86
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,180
Why is there never any—

87
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,660
Why are there never any rooms?

88
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,640
There's never even one room.

89
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,230
Are you out of your mind right now?

90
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,100
Let go of me!

91
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,010
Our administrator isn't the rude type,

92
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,430
but she has a clear sense of calling.

93
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,950
Get back to work.

94
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,830
I will compensate you for your hard work today with a late-night chicken snack.

95
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,120
Student ID Card Oh Kang Hui

96
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,340
Are you okay, Seon Ho?

97
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,020
Be careful. Be careful.

98
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,780
- It's done.
- Ah, seriously, this guy.

99
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,560
What happened?

100
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,290
We were coming out of our dormitory and ran into Min Gyu right then.

101
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,260
- If Min Gyu hadn't helped us out, we would have been in big trouble. Right?
- Yes.

102
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,720
Bro! You were a better guy than I thought.

103
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,550
Huh.

104
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,870
Is this situation fun for you guys?

105
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,640
No.

106
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,940
But, Kang Hui, why are your clothes like that?

107
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,490
- What are you looking at?
- No no. I didn't see.

108
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,130
Go in quickly.

109
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,490
Seeing that all the lights are on, they will probably have roll call in the women's dormitory again.

110
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,160
Oh, okay. Thank you.

111
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,590
Then shall we also go back in slowly?

112
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,240
Oh, okay. It's also really late.

113
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,010
Hey, hey Seon Ho! Hey Seon Ho!

114
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,020
Hey No Beom Tae, Jo Jun Wuk.

115
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,300
Oh my head!

116
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,770
Where did it go?

117
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,970
You still couldn't find it?

118
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,260
Why don't you just get it reissued quickly? It's inconvenient without a student ID.

119
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,890
He suddenly appeared at that moment, and saved us.

120
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,870
Park Min Gyu helped us?

121
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,600
That is... somehow he happened to help us.

122
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,060
Hey, bro. But do you really not remember anything that happened yesterday?

123
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,270
Not even a single thing?

124
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,220
I must have made a lot of mistakes to Kang Hui, right?

125
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,870
Mistakes? Would it be mistakes after all?

126
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,770
That's gross.

127
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,690
Seon Ho, it's okay.

128
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,200
You only did it after being drunk.

129
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,190
Let's just hope she takes that into consideration. Let's eat first.

130
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,490
Hey, weren't Park Min Gyu last words really cool yesterday?

131
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,220
What do you mean by cool?

132
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,350
Why? What did he say?

133
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,160
"Hey, No Beom Tae, Jo Jun Wuk."

134
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,830
Today, Kang Hui wasn't here.

135
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,990
If rumors spread and it gets tough for Kang Hui again, I won't spare you.

136
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,670
- Park Min Gyu said that?
- Hm.

137
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,750
He said that. I thought he would report it to the student council and we'd be in big trouble.

138
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,620
I didn't know it before, but that punk Park Min Gyu is totally a man.

139
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,000
I almost fell for him yesterday— Wow, beef bulgogi!

140
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,390
Wow, beef bulgogi! Beef bulgogi! Seon Ho, beef bulgogi!

141
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,690
You eat up!

142
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,930
Kang Hui!

143
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,270
It's over. It's over.

144
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,910
It's over?

145
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,970
The beef bulgogi's seasoning is so perfect.

146
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,120
Wow, look at its color. Eat up, Beom Tae.

147
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,420
Hey Seon Ho! Seon Ho!
♫ Like a shining star ♫

148
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,320
Ah! Why did we have to meet like that?

149
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,330
Kang Hui!

150
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,290
♫ The place you and I are going to look toward is the same ♫

151
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,200
♫ We are going to dream the same dream again. ♫

152
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,100
Kang Hui.

153
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,500
♫ Can you feel it? ♫

154
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,980
♫ That's what I want to say only to you ♫

155
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,240
Oh, what is it?

156
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,060
That is...

157
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,910
♫ Love isn't a big deal ♫

158
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,480
♫ I'm going to take a step forward now feeling great ♫
Oh!

159
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,980
♫ No, there is one more thing I want from you. ♫

160
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,480
That is... I'm really sorry about yesterday.

161
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,980
Sorry?

162
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,660
Uh... No, it's not that.

163
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:15,400
That is... I don't remember anything from last night.

164
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,250
My memory's totally blanked out.

165
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,060
Ah. You don't remember?

166
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,060
But, if you don't remember, does what happened become something that didn't happen?

167
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,970
Because of people like you, the number of bad guys, who were in a state of weakness or intoxicated,

168
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,960
wanting a reduction in their sentences for those extenuating circumstances is increasing! Do you know that?!

169
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,830
- Kang Hui.
- Huh? Do you remember my name?

170
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,490
Why? Forget that too.

171
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,870
K—K...

172
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,650
Hey.

173
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,530
Have you ever thought that because of your thoughtless action Kang Hui could be in trouble?

174
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,480
But what did you do to Kang Hui?

175
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,310
Come this way.

176
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,390
Geez, but it seems like something's up with that detective.

177
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,310
Why?

178
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,080
I thought you wouldn't be sober yet from drinking yesterday,

179
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,060
but you're checking the CCTV footage first thing in the morning.

180
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,730
Oh, that jerk got drunk that day and lost his wallet.

181
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,580
- What a mess.
- It's a headache when detectives lose their ID cards.

182
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:01,090
Oh, what can you do? Just wait, I'll find it for you.

183
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,980
I taught her how to use a knife in real-life situations,

184
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,260
Real-life situations?

185
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,480
I have two stars. I have two previous convictions.

186
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,340
285

187
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,290
Size 285.

188
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,160
That day he came—

189
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,290
That's a first.

190
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,730
Why are you taking a peek at someone else's smelly shoes?

191
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,690
Did Cheol Jin come alone that day too?

192
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,190
I remembered after watching the CCTV,

193
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,850
he came alone and didn't even touch the snacks.

194
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,060
And he drank around two bottles of soju and left.

195
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,290
Look at this once.

196
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,890
Okay, let me see.

197
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,830
33 Ba 6360

198
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,180
It was raining and there were no customers. I mean,

199
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,180
why would he grab a taxi and not tell me his destination?

200
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,480
He said to just go anywhere, but where is there to go in that area.

201
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,820
So I was going to go around the fishing spot,

202
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,530
and suddenly I was told to stop the car because he had to throw up.

203
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,820
Driver, please stop here.

204
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,530
On the way to the fishing spot, I saw someone throwing up on the side of the road.

205
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,320
He also stumbled as if he had been drinking.

206
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,920
Hey, Driver Song! Aren't you going to lunch?

207
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,150
- I can go now, right?
- One last thing.

208
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,220
At that time, why did you go to the National Police University?

209
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,220
I went there after I got a call from Mr. Go.

210
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,560
Do you know Mr. Go well?

211
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,230
His customers are our regulars.

212
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,550
But he doesn't remember that.

213
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,550
Professor Go ...

214
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,120
Something smells fishy.

215
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,760
Do you like fishing?

216
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,310
I didn't like it at first.

217
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,000
I like the feeling of throwing the bait and getting a bite immediately.

218
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,120
I came to like it after visiting from time to time.

219
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,260
If only we could catch criminals that way.

220
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,240
It's noisy at the school or at a crime scene,

221
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,290
but it's quiet here.

222
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,360
Can I also cast it once?

223
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,610
It's expensive.

224
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,000
You don't have any friends, right?

225
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,690
Eh?

226
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,680
Yeah. Did you look into it?

227
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,180
Yes. But the phone calls made to Park Gyeong Wi are all so short

228
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,220
and the locations are so different that pinpointing is hard.

229
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,400
Detective Jo. Can you look into someone for me?

230
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,960
So what you saw was... Kang Hui's torn shirt button?

231
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,880
And her face was red too.

232
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,550
Nope. There's no reason to be suspicious about that.

233
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,490
I had been drinking and it was cold outside.

234
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,420
What exactly happened?

235
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,870
Listen carefully. In my opinion...

236
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,870
Hey! Oh Kang Hui! What did I do that was so wrong? Is it a crime to be drunk?

237
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,790
I asked you if it was a crime!

238
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,490
Hey. Where are you grabbing?

239
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,090
Hey! No matter how drunk I was, I wouldn't grab at Kang Hui's collar.

240
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:09,100
Yeah. Even though any investigation starts with a hypothesis, that's a bit far-fetched.

241
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,290
Is it?

242
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,440
Well. What do you think?

243
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,910
Hey!

244
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,430
What is that jerk imagining! Do you want to die by my hand?

245
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,930
Calm down! Calm down!

246
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,260
Let's consider every option.

247
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,260
And what goes on when a man and woman are locked up in a storage room ...

248
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,760
- Hey. Come here.
Hey, hey, hey.

249
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,040
This jerk.

250
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,340
Where did that jerk go?

251
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,360
But, if you don't remember, does what happened become something that didn't happen?

252
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,940
What did I do? I'm going crazy.

253
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,910
Hey, punk! Why are you swearing in the hallway? Oh! What's with the weapon?

254
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,460
Why are you hitting my head?!

255
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,190
Why are you yelling?!

256
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,260
How many times did I call you?

257
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,330
You're out of your mind. Hey! Put that down and follow me.

258
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,760
Why did you call me?

259
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,350
Hey! Aren't you going to investigate?

260
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,020
Oh.

261
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,090
Oh?

262
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,640
I'm sorry.

263
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,710
What is it? Why are you frowning again?

264
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:03,910
Professor. Is there any way to investigate a suspect that has blacked out?

265
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,380
What?

266
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,650
You know. Like when you have to interrogate drunken witnesses or suspects.

267
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,790
You should start with a cognitive interview.  (Interview to see how much witness remembers about the incident.)

268
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,780
We put together the statements from other eyewitnesses.

269
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,460
And look for evidence. And put the pieces together.

270
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,120
No. Other than that.

271
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,980
Other than?

272
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,680
Other than that. Investigating someone under hypnosis?

273
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,370
Well, that kind of... I don't know!

274
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,020
And is that important right now?

275
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,280
When was it that we spoke?

276
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,190
Why did you call?

277
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,490
This is ... The burner cell phone tower was captured, but

278
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,360
the location keeps changing.

279
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,820
Cell Tower Outgoing Records

280
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,170
I thought about it while looking through Ajhussi Cheol Jin's phone records.

281
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,990
How about analyzing the pattern of the locations?

282
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,290
What are you talking about?

283
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,780
There is a program that figures out call patterns and frequency.

284
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,060
If we investigate using that, I think we'll be able to figure out the actual phone call locations.

285
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,200
Are you filming a James Bond movie?

286
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,260
It is used by the FBI, so we can code it too.

287
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,110
It will take a while though.

288
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,210
About two weeks.

289
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,870
- Should I do it or not?
- Hey, punk!

290
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,480
If there is something like that, of course, you should do it immediately!

291
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,850
Now you finally look like that Yoon I know.

292
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:27,220
Of course. You do what you do well, and I'll do what I do well.

293
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,880
Isn't this the true meaning of collaboration?

294
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,190
Well. Sure. True cooperation...

295
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,740
Get some rest.

296
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,240
Okay.

297
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Hey. But how many drinks did you have last night

298
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,320
before your memory blanked out?

299
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,640
You must like investigating blackouts.

300
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,740
It's not that.

301
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,720
Then go to the place where everything went blank.

302
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,190
Evidence and clues are always left on the site of the incident.

303
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,240
It's really not that.

304
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,030
Authorized Personnel Only

305
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,860
What is this? Why isn't it opening?

306
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,100
It's definitely around here somewhere.

307
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,760
Hey, you, that suspect in love!

308
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,970
Did you come looking for your ID by any chance?

309
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,240
How ...

310
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,560
- Are you two dating?
- No!

311
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,440
Seon Ho must think you're dating. Why aren't you saying anything?

312
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,140
Hey!

313
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:27,140
Yes. Why is that important? Just liking each other matters.

314
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,280
Why am I suddenly wanting to day-drink?

315
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,190
I'm headed out first.

316
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,360
Excuse me, Professor.

317
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,100
Would you mind keeping this a secret?

318
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,740
Hey! I have common sense.

319
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,990
Can't you tell by me excusing myself first?

320
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,310
Hey, Kang Hui!

321
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,450
I

322
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,720
don't want to pretend nothing happened.

323
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,950
What are you saying all of a sudden?

324
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,930
What happened that night at the storage room,

325
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,070
because it did happen.

326
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,830
And it isn't my imagination or a dream

327
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,730
because it really happened.

328
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,470
I'll take responsibility.

329
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,410
- For what?
- All of it.

330
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,990
♫ I'm walking in the street ♫

331
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,580
♫ And follow the first steps ♫

332
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,690
♫ I'm searching for some– ♫

333
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,940
You don't remember, do you?

334
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,450
How dare you try to trick me.

335
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,830
This is crazy. Hey, Kang Seon Ho. You don't remember, do you?

336
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,900
- Kang Hui.
- If you didn't remember, why did you keep pretending to remember?

337
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,830
Kang Hui, let's talk.

338
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,660
Talk about what? Hey, come here.

339
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,760
This punk ...

340
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,380
He doesn't do the investigation I asked him to.

341
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,110
This campus is full of blooming love.

342
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,970
I sent you Professor Go's personal information.

343
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,410
Okay. What does this guy do?

344
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,880

Cheongram Sports Festival List

349
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,370
The 41st Cheongram Sports Festival
Blue Team
White Team

350
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,790
Oh, the Cheongram team list came out. Hey, Seon Ho!

351
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,860
We're on the same team! What? What?

352
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,180
Look at this, Beom Tae.

353
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,150
- What?
- What is this? Sunbae.

354
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,780
It looks like Noona and I are meant to be.

355
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,390
Hey! Coincidence! It's just a coincidence!

356
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:15,150
No. It it fate.
 Kang Seon Ho | Oh Kang Hui

357
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,310
Hey. Are you guys friends?

358
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,900
Hey, come on! Don't get all riled up already.

359
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,530
The winner of this Cheongram Sports Festival

360
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,650
gets a special leave for the weekend!

361
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,790
Really? It's not a one-day leave, but an overnight leave?

362
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,870
Seon Ho, let's win. For sure.

363
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,540
Let's do that.

364
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,710
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

365
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,610
For sure. Let's win. Fighting.

366
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,860
Hey!

367
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,130
All the losers are on my team.

368
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,630
Exactly, I heard professor Gwon Hyeok Pil is also in charge.

369
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,900
Hey! Do you want me to show you my skills?

370
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,720
Yes, please make sure to win.

371
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,310
Before that, let's finish one job.

372
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,750
What?

373
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,810
Criminal Investigation Record
Special Assault Crime
The laundering of money and proceeds from an illegal gambling enterprise

374
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,310
Professor Go's criminal record is ...

375
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:20,610
Two criminal convictions from ten years ago, one charge is operating an illegal gambling establishment.

376
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,980
Besides that, he was the last person with Cheol Jin on the day of the incident.

377
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,750
Even his shoe size is 285.

378
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,610
Then, don't tell me Professor Go is ...

379
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,920
This is still only circumstantial.

380
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,500
We have to confirm it. How can we do it?

381
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,590
Fishing...?

382
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,990
Goodness, you two must be very close!

383
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,260
I'm sorry for last time.

384
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,560
No, it's okay. It was just a mistake.

385
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,470
Did that detective find his wallet?

386
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,570
Well, now he knows the taxi number so he'll find it.

387
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,350
That's good to know.

388
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,450
Tell me if you need anything.

389
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,690
Okay.
- Yes.

390
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,350
So that program, is it done?

391
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,180
Professor is throwing the bait.

392
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,180
Yes, it's almost done.

393
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,160
I'll be able to trace the burner phone's movement within this week.

394
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,940
The laptop is in your room, right?

395
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,720
Bait that he will come for, no matter what, if he is the culprit. Yes.

396
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,320
Keep that safe. If we can trace the phone's movements, we can catch the suspect right away.

397
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,640
The first appeal of two people from a group who ran an illegal gambling site with tens of billions of won

398
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,900
will be held on the 5th of next month.

399
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,160
During the first trial last month,

400
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,250
the judge sentenced Mr. Jeong and Ms. Oh
[The first appeal trial for the operators of a large-scale 'illegal gambling site']

401
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,580
to 10 months and 2 years in prison, respectively, for running an illegal gambling site.

402
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,640
Gambling fraud?

403
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,400
Hey, isn't that your mom's trial?

404
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,260
Right, it is my mom's trial.

405
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,710
They're making their argument

406
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,550
in order to file an appeal.

407
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,870
The prosecution stated they will look for more witnesses and testimonies.

408
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,980
I heard it's Kang Hui's mom.

409
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,850
How can she show her face at school?

410
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,580
So?

411
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,020
So what? They are just excited because they got something to break their boredom.

412
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,300
They are enjoying the gossip in every way.

413
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,830
Kang Hui would definitely want to go since it's her mom's trial.

414
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,590
- You said the if you win the Cheongram Sports Festival, you'll get a special leave, right?
- Yes.

415
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:03,300
Why would you go, Grandma? That must be hard for you.

416
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,260
Listen to me, please. I'm telling you I'll go.

417
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,660
I'm not angry, Grandma.

418
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,710
Why would I be angry at you, Grandma?

419
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,620
I have class again, Grandma. I'll call you back later.

420
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,900
How do you always make me

421
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,910
stand on the edge of a cliff, Mom?

422
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,390
What will you look into?

423
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,800
The judge for your mother's trial,

424
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,590
I heard he has dealt with a lot of similar cases, so he doesn't give harsh sentences.

425
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,210
So, don't worry a lot.

426
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,210
Did you always have this much interest in other's matters?

427
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,570
You know that's not it.

428
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,550
Yes, I know. But why are you doing this?

429
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,450
- Kang Hui—
- You could ignore or badmouth me instead.

430
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,030
Or get your nose out of my business.

431
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,480
Kang—

432
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,880
During the Cheongram Sports Festival, the school will be completely empty,

433
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,370
so if he's the culprit, he will definitely come that day.

434
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,910
You put a sensor on your laptop, right? For when someone accesses it.

435
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,770
Take this.

436
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,870
Hey!

437
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,470
What?

438
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,800
Get your senses together.

439
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,060
Yes, sir.

440
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,450
- This is—
- This is a smartwatch.

441
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,200
Link it with your cell phone and check it often.

442
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,620
Yes, I'll do it, Professor. Anything.

443
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,610
Anyway, I'll do everything so let's do the Cheongram sports festival first.

444
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,500
What?

445
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,120
I have to win that special leave,

446
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,630
I definitely have to get it, but because you are on our team .

447
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,160
For now, let's do our best for the Cheongram sports festival.

448
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,000
This jerk hasn't been listening to what I have been saying.

449
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,860
I will win for sure.

450
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:16,010
No! I will definitely win.

451
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,520
Listen carefully.

452
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,550
During the Cheongram Sports Festival, the school will be completely empty...

453
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,400
Relations team

454
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,030
I'm going to win the special leave.

455
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,550
I'm going to get the special leave and give it to Kang Hui.

456
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:40,570
♫ We know the path our heart's chose ♫

457
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,280
But we are training too hard.

We have to win no matter what. No matter what.

459
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,920
Let's go!

460
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,110

Control your breath.

00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,770
♫ Fly away ♫

480
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,770
We just had to have such clothes.

481
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,430
What on earth does he do every night?

482
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,090
Hey! I ran 100 meters in 10 seconds at your age.

483
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,830
You said you didn't do well.

484
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,880
I did. I did it, you jerk. I did.

485
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,550
Then, you would have been a track and field athlete and not a policeman.

486
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,710
Why do you never lose with words?

487
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,720
What will you do by winning against a young guy like me?

488
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,390
Danger

489
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,240
Oh, Seon Ho!

490
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,570
I only moved the mouse but something came on the laptop.

491
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,980
Intrusion Detection System
Security Code

492
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,670
Hey, how did you know and come?

493
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,960
Did you catch him? Did you catch him? What kind of a jerk is he?

494
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,160
What ki—

495
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
P—Professor.

496
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,750
Intrusion Detection System

497
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,980
You jerk. Why are you touching other's things?

498
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,140
This guy will become a thief. A thief.

499
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,740
Ah, that surprised me.

500
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,930
Thief?

501
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,250
Let him be. He's just blabbering.

502
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,480
But what is that?

503
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,390
It's our team uniform.

504
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,880
Oh Kang Hui...

505
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,120
Put a check mark and take your uniform.

506
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,000
Kang Seon Ho, you also check it and take your team uniform.

507
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,990
Yes, yes.

508
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,790
You're on the white team.

509
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,560
I'm on the white team too.

510
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,700
Why aren't you asking?

511
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,890
My mom's trial. You also know, right?

512
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,750
I want to listen when you want to talk,

513
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,680
like now.

514
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,080
What is good about it?

515
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,390
Why are you so sincere about the Cheongram sports festival?

516
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,920
I have to get the special leave this time.

517
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,780
Why? Do you have to go somewhere?

518
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,610
Yes.

519
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,770
Where? What, are you going to see your mom?

520
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,780
I don't have a mom.

521
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,300
I'm sorry.

522
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,650
But I'm going to go see my dad,

523
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,400
you, and your mom's trial.

524
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,870
That's why I have to get the special leave.

525
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,660
I'll take responsibility for yours, too.

526
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,350
Why do you keep taking responsibility?

527
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,860
He remembers.
♫ Truly I wanna know ♫

528
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,800
I do. I should take responsibility.

529
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,020
Of course, I should.
♫ What is this feeling that I'm feeling all at once? ♫

530
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,250
That night ...

531
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,620
So, let's go together, Kang Hui. Yes?

532
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,360
♫ like a shining star ♫

533
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,090
♫ When I see you, I'm filled with the thoughts of you. ♫

534
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,810
Of course, I should take responsibility.

535
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,920
♫ The place you and I are going to look toward is the same ♫

536
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,000
You crazy punk!

537
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,280
I am a crazy punk, but let's go together, Kang Hui? Yes?

538
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,030
♫ That's what I want ♫

539
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,790
Kang Hui!
♫ to say only to you ♫

540
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,954
♫ That's what I still must hear only from you  ♫

541
00:41:53,953 --> 00:41:56,760
The 41st Cheongram Sports Festival

542
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,750
Shall we go together?

543
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,090
Who are all those outsiders?

544
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,160
You didn't know?

545
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,630
During the Cheongram Sports Festival, the cafeteria is closed, and we order from the local restaurants.

546
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:19,540
The owners stay and watch since they are already here to drop off the food.

547
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,450
Yes! Professor Go is here!

548
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,640
- Chicken! Chicken!
- Professor Choi.

549
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,100
Chicken and beer go hand in hand.

550
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,140
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

551
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,680
It's so refreshing.

552
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:48,030
The word 'jeon', from the Cheongram Sports Festival, has the same meaning as war.

553
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,890
In other words, it is a fierce war disguised as a sports festival.

554
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,770
In order to win the war,

555
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:19,520
you must gain the momentum in the first fight.

556
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,120
Fighting!

557
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,110
Come here! Come here. Come here.

558
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,620
Are you going to fight with your mouth?

559
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,320
Gwon Hyeok Pil!

560
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,550
Come here!

561
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,580
Come here!

562
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,990
He's biting me! He's biting me!

563
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,680
Our Professor Yu Dong Man is a hit.

564
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,550
Can't you change the players?

565
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,350
If I went in there, I'd knock them all down.

566
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:58,700
I will pull some strings so you can join in the next semester.

567
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,220
Professor Gwon is also trying really hard.

568
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,350
Those two are the same age, right?

569
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,960
That's right.

570
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,130
It's nice to see they've become good friends.

571
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,610
Fighting!

572
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,800
This game seem like it's fun!

573
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,210
Thank you.

574
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,690
And pizza.

575
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,630
That looks good.

576
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,780
It's like a buffet here, I love it.

577
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:55,830
It's nice and all. But why does the sports festival seem like I'm watching "Hometown Report"?

578
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,990
Yes, it does. It's too crowded. It can't be like this, though.

579
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,180
It's good, isn't it?

580
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,370
Thank you.

581
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,100
National Police University

582
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,760
I told you to aim for the head! The head!

583
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,330
Make them faint!

584
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:51,310
How could you be saying exactly what I wanted to say?

585
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,620
They should aim right at their heads.

586
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,430
Hey! Damn it.

587
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,680
They'll get hurt. Go easy on them.

588
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,010
- Okay.
- Okay.

589
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,250
Good job!

590
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,880
Let's get one more.

591
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,820
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

592
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,420
No!

593
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,650
Oh my goodness!

594
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,180
It's a double nosebleed.

595
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,390
It looks like two nosebleeds.

596
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,280
Beom Tae.

597
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,800
Beom Tae.

598
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,860
- Oh my goodness, are you okay?
- Are you okay?

599
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:09,370
What do you mean by an advisor? I didn't hear anything!

600
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:11,460
About that ...

601
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:23,340
I'm sorry. Because of me, the game stopped for nothing, and the momentum was interrupted.

602
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,540
No, we were already losing. Let's admit it.

603
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,670
But it's still 1:1.

604
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,670
That's right, we can come back and win the relay race.

605
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:36,820
That's right! That's right! Seon Ho has been training so much for the relay.

606
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,260
You even went out and ran on days we didn't have running drills.

607
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,250
- If we win the special leave, go out to dinner with me.
- Damn it!

608
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,860
That jerk is with alone with Sunbae again!

609
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:01,830
The special leave is for Saturday.

610
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,140
Let's meet in front of the main gate at 11 am.

611
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,070
- How are you feeling? Are you okay?
- Yup!

612
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,260
You have to do well. Fighting! Fighting!

613
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,850
You have to win.

614
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,170
Fighting!

615
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,270
Seon Ho, fighting!

616
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,730
Fighting!

617
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,620
Fighting!

618
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,430
We have to win! We really have to!

619
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,680
This punk. I got it! I got it! We will win.

620
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,480
Fighting!

621
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,020
Ready ...

622
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,200
20210036
Kang Seon Ho

623
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,140
You're almost there! You're almost there!

624
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,160
Give it to me!

625
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,790
- Give it to me!
- Let's go!

626
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,520
No! No! No!

627
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,360
White team! White team!

628
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:30,250
If I win this match, I'm going to give my special leave to Kang Hui.

629
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:34,890
And I'm going to confess that I like her.

630
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,750
I'll never lose to you, punk.

631
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,710
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

632
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:51,560
Hurry! Hurry!

633
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,800
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Gwon Hyeok Pil, fighting!

634
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,050
Fighting!

635
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,790
Fighting!

636
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,620
The special leave is for Saturday.

637
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,900
Meet me in front of the main gate at 11 am.

638
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,510
I will win, I will win.

639
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,130
It's going to be empty inside the school during the Cheongram Sports Festival,

640
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,820
so if he's the suspect, he will definitely show up that day.

641
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,730
If I win this race, I'm going to confess to her.

642
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,200
Gwon Hyeok Pil!

643
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,910
Gwon Hyeok Pil?

644
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,840
Professor!

645
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,520
Professor! Professor!

646
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,130
Professor!

647
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,960
Professor!

648
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,210
Where is he going? Where is he going?

649
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,440
Hey! Kang Seon Ho! Where is he going?!

650
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,060
- Where is he going?
- Where is he going?

651
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,790
Where is he going?

652
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,420
Dormitory

653
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,310
Dormitory

654
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:54,680
I got you! I got you, bastard!

655
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,440
Danger - Intrusion Detection

656
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,400
Yay! Hooray!

657
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:29,320
We would have won!

658
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,930
Hey, you punk. Why are you here?

659
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:49,940
Why didn't you answer your phone?

660
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:53,520
I asked, why are you here?!

661
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,500
Why are you screaming?

662
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,160
They told me not to come back because of the aftereffects from the attack.

663
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,960
So, as of today, I've been appointed as a professor in the leadership department at the National Police University.

664
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,990
So, we're both professors now.

665
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,740
What?

666
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,980
Hey, what the hell is going on with Seon Ho and Professor Yu Dong Man?

667
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,290
I don't know. Do you think something happened? Oh!

668
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,660
Hey, Seon Ho! What happened?

669
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,560
Kang Hui!

670
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,720
Let me explain what happened ...

671
00:55:54,290 --> 00:56:00,840
The 41st Cheongram Sports Festival.

672
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:10,940
What was I expecting, like a fool?

673
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,980
Kang Hui.

674
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,270
If it's not important, let's talk later.

675
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,560
I'm tired.

676
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:47,580
They said, if I don't want to use the special leave, I can give it to someone else.

677
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,290
You need to go to your mother's trial. You use it.

678
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,860
Didn't I tell you before?

679
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,390
Either you gossip about me or ignore it. Those are the only two options.

680
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:11,790
You really don't know why I'm doing this?

681
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,730
I don't know. Why are you being like this?

682
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:23,340
♫ Even if we get distant day by day ♫

683
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:29,890
♫ We would still be in the same place ♫

684
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:36,750
I'll take this to the meeting place.

685
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:41,020
♫ Looking at me ♫

686
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,050
♫ You smile ♫

687
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:44,690
New Student Miss Oh's Shocking Secret!!

688
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,860
Administrator.

689
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:53,000
Please delete the article attacking Oh Kang Hui from the bulletin board of the school website.

690
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,380
Hurry, please! Before she sees it.

691
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,980
♫ You hugged me when I cried ♫

692
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,370
I ...

693
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,030
like you.

694
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:14,620
♫ Even if I go back ♫

695
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:27,930
♫ No matter how many times I repeat, my love is for you ♫

696
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:35,130
♫ Because you are my only love ♫

697
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:43,530
Cheol Jin asked for it, punk. He wanted to work with you.

698
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,420
That's why I gave the order.

699
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:49,260
But you didn't even discuss it with me—

700
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,700
I have to go, for now.

701
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,670
What happened?

702
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,780
Because of this ...

703
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:07,750
Do you know what I gave up today, because of this?

704
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,660
What, you punk?

705
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:14,020
Someone broke into my empty room and messed with my laptop.

706
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:17,160
My family photo was broken.

707
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,020
Team Leader

708
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,280
Professor.

709
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,310
Professor.

710
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,760
Professor.

711
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:08,050
The real war may have just begun.

712
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:30,780
♫ We know the path our heart's chose ♫

713
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:36,820
♫ We don't know how to take a step back ♫

714
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,260
♫ We have never learned nor do we want to know. ♫

715
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:45,650
♫ Yeah, we're taking a deep breath with a tough look ♫

716
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:49,290
♫ and let's run All Ready Go farther than anyone else ♫

717
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:51,610
Police University
♫ We are faster than fast ♫

718
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,180
Why did you lie to me?

719
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:56,130
I wanted to kick you but instead, I took it out on the poor trash bin.

720
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,280
The last car to Asan has already closed.

721
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,300
What?

722
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,010
I'm going on a date today.

723
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:04,520
- What are you doing today?
- I have a very important appointment.

724
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,650
What? No Beom Tae?

725
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:07,250
Why did Ahjeossi Park Cheol Jin suddenly come?

726
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,190
Am I the only one who finds it strange?

727
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,740
Him showing up at the school at this moment?

728
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,160
You look like you're very close with Seon Ho.

729
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,260
What do you think he gained from planting a bug?

730
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,100
Kang Seon Ho.

731
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,620
You told me that the culprit is in Police University. I definitely have to catch him.

732
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,590
♫ (One shot) ♫

733
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:24,520
♫ Yeah, we're taking a deep breath with a tough look ♫
