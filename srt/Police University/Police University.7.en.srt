1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,540
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,540
Hey!

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,050
Where is he going? Where is he going? Hey! Hey! Hey!

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,050
- Where is he going?
- Where is he going?

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,650
Where is he going?

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,150
Dormitory

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,210
I got you! I got you, bastard!

8
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,420
Hey, you punk. Why are you here?

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,980
Why didn't you answer your phone?

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,040
I asked, why are you here?!

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,940
Why are you screaming?

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,570
They told me not to come back because of the aftereffects of the attack.

13
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,850
So, as of today, I've been appointed as a professor in the leadership department

14
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,580
at the National Police University.

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
So, we're both professors now.

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,200
What?

17
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,490
Episode 7

18
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,510
I thought you would like it if I came to surprise you,

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,240
but your expression says otherwise.

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,570
It's because I'm tired. Because I'm tired.

21
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,580
Why did you have to come today, of all days?

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,470
I had to come as soon as possible to help support you.

23
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,290
What?

24
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,800
I heard from the team leader that you are investigating the

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,780
illegal gamblers from here.

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,610
You told him I said that they're here at the National Police University.

27
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,100
Punk, shut up!

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,530
Where do you think you are?

29
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,220
Go, you jerk. Get lost.

30
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,180
You're making me more tired.

31
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,920
Where are you going?

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,520
We have to get some so-maek (soju and beer) since I'm here.

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,340
There's a pork rind restaurant out front.

34
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,320
Cheol Jin asked for it, punk. He wanted to work with you.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,600
- That's why I gave the order.
- But you didn't even discuss it with me—

36
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,490
For now, I got it.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,430
What happened?

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,450
Because of this ...

39
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,490
Do you know what I gave up today, because of this?

40
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,300
What, you punk?

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,410
Someone broke into my empty room and messed with my laptop.

42
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,310
My family photo was broken.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,400
Team Leader

44
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,490
Professor.

45
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,500
Professor.

46
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,240
Professor.

47
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,290
This bastard ...

48
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,290
is having fun.

49
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,630
Professor.

50
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,720
Professor!

51
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,050
- What are you going to do?
- Hey.

52
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,060
This is a homemade listening device,

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,380
and it has a maximum transmission range of 3 kilometers.

54
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,480
Is there any other punk other than that Mr. Go jerk

55
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,210
who could have been eavesdropping within that range?

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,750
You don't know that!

57
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,500
Even if you are right, what are you going to do right now?

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,300
I'll take care of that, so move out of the way, punk!

59
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,990
Just calm down for a second!

60
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,370
I'm going to catch that damn rat!

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,400
- Professor, come on!
- I said let go of me, punk!

62
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,570
Punk, why would you hold onto me?! Why?!

63
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,230
Why?!

64
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,420
You told me to stop you if you're running wildly without thinking about the consequences.

65
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,570
You said that's why a police officer needs a partner and the reason why two are better than one!

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,100
You told me to keep doing that from now on. Why?

67
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,350
- Punk, the situation right now is—
- Does the situation change things?

68
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,640
If that's so, then take back what you said.

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,490
I don't care what happens anymore.

70
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,720
I'm not going to stop you anymore!

71
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,860
So take back what you said.

72
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,320
Punk!

73
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,510
How can I, as a man, take back something I've already said?

74
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,970
That's embarrassing!

75
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,780
And this punk, since when did you listen to me so well?

76
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,880
All right, all right.

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
That son of a b*tch walked in and out of my office

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,390
without me knowing,

79
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,890
and I lost my mind for a second.

80
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,110
I'm sorry. Happy now?!

81
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,040
Why add in the "happy now" after apologizing?

82
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,550
Wait until you're my age and see if you do the same thing or not.

83
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,920
So what are you going to do now?

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,880
What do you mean, what am I going to do?

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,640
I'm going to get the serial number of the wiretap,

86
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,300
and find out first when, where, who,

87
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,730
and why someone bought it.

88
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,680
After that, I'll catch the culprit.

89
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,620
- Hey! Stop!
- What are those escaped prisoner losers doing?

90
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,160
Stop!

91
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,230
Hey, you son of a bitch!

92
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,290
It's a good thing it turned out this way.

93
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,700
Yes.

94
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,450
What's with your expression?

95
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,800
What are you thinking about?

96
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,150
I was wondering

97
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,250
what that jerk got out of the wiretapping.

98
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,870
Ow!

99
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,740
Think about what we got, punk.

100
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,530
The culprit is within our range. We haven't wasted our time so far.

101
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,260
That jerk was so scared that he set up a wiretap! Why?!

102
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,830
Because we are so close to finding him!

103
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,520
That's what's important!

104
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,350
If the culprit's within our range, that's really dangerous.

105
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,120
He even saw my family photo.

106
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,050
- Seriously?!
- This is exactly what that jerk wants.

107
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,830
Us getting scared over this and backing off!

108
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,040
To make us not investigate!

109
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,170
You punk, do you want to do what that jerk wants?

110
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,070
It's my first time!

111
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,510
I've never done anything like this before!

112
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,150
Isn't it natural to be scared and afraid?

113
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,210
How dare you act like a baby?

114
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,240
Hey. You should have gotten rid of that fear when you got to the National Police University, punk.

115
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,650
Hey!

116
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,120
Hey?

117
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,380
What? Are you asking for a fight without considering our rank?!

118
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,050
Hey, come on. Come on. Come on!

119
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,270
- That lunatic.
- I can hear you.

120
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,580
What? What?

121
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,060
Do you really want to fight?

122
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,980
Why is Park Cheol Jin here all of a sudden?

123
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,790
Am I the only one who finds that weird?

124
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,380
Him showing up at the school at this moment?

125
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,580
Don't bark up the wrong tree.

126
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,190
Cheol Jin is here to help our investigation,

127
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,160
and I knew all about it, too.

128
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,770
Is that true?

129
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,310
I'm asking you if that's the truth?

130
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,820
Of course, it's the truth, punk!

131
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,150
Hey, Kang Seon Ho.

132
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,290
Why did you do that?

133
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,390
At the track field?

134
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,260
That was ...

135
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,260
because I ... had an upset stomach.

136
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,130
Maybe I ate something bad at lunch.

137
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,880
I felt really sick.

138
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,810
Is that the truth?

139
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,030
All right, head in.

140
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,360
Do you know about the serial murder case that took place in saunas in 2004?

141
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,590
The rain was falling,

142
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,110
and the night was cold.

143
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,990
The sharp ringing of the phone broke through the sound of the rain.

144
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,450
"Th-This is a sauna in Dogok-dong, and s-s-someone is dying!"

145
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,090
"What did you say?"

146
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,080
When we arrived at the scene,

147
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,880
the victim was already dead.

148
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,300
The culprit had already run away after setting a fire.

149
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,850
I thought to myself, "Oh, all the evidence has been destroyed. This is going to be a headache."

150
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,550
But at that moment, someone from afar said

151
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,150
"Professor Seo, look at this!"

152
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,670
One step, two steps.

153
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,460
I approached the burned corpse.

154
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,910
"Oh, that's...!" The vivid fingerprint of the culprit was left on the victim!

155
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,850
Ay, don't lie.

156
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,480
Are you serious?

157
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,570
It became the first murder case in the country that was solved

158
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,890
with the culprit's fingerprint left on the victim.

159
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,130
Professor Yu, how long were you...

160
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,690
I was told that you've been in the teaching profession your whole life.

161
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,820
Rumors are just rumors, don't you agree?

162
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,130
Rumors? Yeah, well...

163
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,100
What brings you all the way to the club?

164
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,630
Well, I just wanted to ask you a favor.

165
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,670
Police University

166
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,090
Why is the TV off?

167
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,110
Oh. Oh. Oh.

168
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,220
That's it!

169
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,640
The first baseman is Kim Jae Ho

170
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,510
and he is running at full speed!

171
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,740
"There's been no beer like this before." This is Gossi Beer.

172
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,790
Hel— Dammit.

173
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,580
Getting back to TV.

174
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,120
What?

175
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,370
Where did the remote control go?

176
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,680
Could you please check if the fingerprints on this remote

177
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,710
are on this laptop?

178
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,940
Within that request,

179
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,840
shouldn't there be the five Ws (Who, What, When Where, and Why) or introduction, development, turn, and conclusion?

180
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,890
Would you be okay? You could be mentally disturbed.

181
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,690
No, I have a mental state that's like glass.

182
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,440
Let's just say I heard you say it. It's not a difficult task anyway.

183
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,280
Thank you.

184
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,940
Ah, I do have a difficult request too.

185
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,150
I...like you.

186
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,350
Are you that upset?

187
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,410
Do you want to use my special leave?

188
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,450
No, it's not that.

189
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,610
Hey! Daebak!

190
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,620
Daebak! Daebak! Did you hear it?

191
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,590
We're all getting special leave!

192
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,680
- What?
- The faculty just decided.

193
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,610
Everyone here can go out!

194
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,420
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

195
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,920
I think Professor Seo pushed for it!

196
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,280
Professor Seo seems to be a romantic at times like these.

197
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,640
That professor was very scary when I was in school.

198
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,680
- Oh, you said you graduated from this university, right?
- Yes.

199
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,730
There's nothing you don't know. You must have become close already.

200
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,400
I was in the 25th graduating class.

201
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,810
I went to the Yongin campus, so I'm not familiar with this one.

202
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,390
But how did you become close with Professor Yu Dong Man?

203
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,370
Oh, he was my first mentor at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

204
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,210
After that, I kept following him around, basically stuck to his side.

205
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,950
You seem like you remember everything.

206
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,340
Are you sure you suffer from dissociative amnesia?

207
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,530
That illness is very tricky.

208
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,980
Some erase all memories of their first love,

209
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,210
and some erase memories of all the people they met during their mandatory military service.

210
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,370
They say a certain part gets erased fully.

211
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,910
I don't know which part was erased for me.

212
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,640
It would be nice if a bad memory were erased.

213
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,830
Thank you.

214
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,740
So nosy...

215
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,060
Did professor Yu already go home?

216
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,990
- Pardon?
- Because the CCTVs are old,

217
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,450
we've been replacing them for the past month.

218
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,920
We have no recordings at all.

219
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,630
Then what do I do?!

220
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,700
Pardon? About what?

221
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,760
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,500
Professor Yu Dong Man

223
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,890
You scared me.

224
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,370
Hey, loser! Mentor isn't here. Why are you here?

225
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,110
I don't know if you saw the sign,

226
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,040
but how can you order fried eggs at a pub?

227
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,570
There's no law that you can't sell fried eggs at a pub!

228
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,280
You would know the law better than me.

229
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,000
The one who breaks the law knows it better than the one who follows the law.

230
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,440
Well, everyone has a different way of living life.

231
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,570
But, at the relay race yesterday,

232
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,860
did you see me win before you left?

233
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,010
Relay race?

234
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,250
I didn't see it, why?

235
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,040
No, I just wondered if you saw.

236
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,580
Since you said you came to school yesterday.

237
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,180
Oh, just to look around and check out the residence hall, too.

238
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,870
Why are you so startled? I got more startled.

239
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,660
I'll be going now. It's almost time for the roll call.

240
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,280
I saw, of course.

241
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,600
You were ridiculously fast!

242
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,980
So you saw it.

243
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,220
First, Seon Ho quickly ran off,

244
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,280
and then you raced to follow him.

245
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,730
Are you calling that winning the race right now?

246
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,270
Goodness...

247
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,360
This jerk was watching everything?

248
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,870
Wow.

249
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,910
But, you seem to be very close to Seon Ho.

250
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,580
You two were like a pair. Totally.

251
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,560
That jerk!

252
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,240
I was wondering what that punk gained by installing a listening device.

253
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,040
Kang Seon Ho!

254
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,600
Sunbae!

255
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,830
Seon Ho, it's finally today.

256
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,930
Did you not sleep?

257
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,990
Students in uniform are not to do anything to undermine the dignity of the National Police University.

258
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,660
Putting your hands in your pockets, clasping your hands on your back,

259
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:30,240
spitting, smoking, or eating while walking around, is prohibited.

260
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,910
Also, you are not allowed to enter any places that can damage your reputation or dignity,

261
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,580
nor are you allowed to enter places that are only made for entertainment.

262
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,990
Refrain from any behavior that can damage the dignity of Police University.

263
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,090
Please keep in mind that your actions in uniform can soon

264
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,460
become the image of a police officer.

265
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,510
Now we will check your uniforms and hair.

266
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,700
Your romanticism shines once more.

267
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,050
Though it goes against fairness.

268
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,650
I told you to be mindful of the atmosphere even if you're speaking the truth.

269
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,550
People will curse at you for being annoying.

270
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,520
Worry about yourself and stop hanging out with abnormal people.

271
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,790
Don't fight.

272
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,290
Unfortunately, it wasn't my romanticism.

273
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,880
Excuse me?

274
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,220
Wear your badge correctly.

275
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,420
Shine your shoes.

276
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,320
I have a date today. What are you doing today?

277
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,620
I have really important plans.

278
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,380
Plans?

279
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,240
You don't have any secrets from me, right?

280
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,340
Hey, there are none! There are none. Of course, it's nothing like that.

281
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,790
Seon Ho, what are you doing today?

282
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,090
I ... don't really know yet.

283
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,780
If the culprit's within our range, that's really dangerous.

284
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,700
He even saw my family photo.

285
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,350
Seong Su, what are you doing?

286
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,230
- I don't know, punk.
- Why don't you know?

287
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,560
What is it? Did you forget something?

288
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,780
Yes, I need to stop by the dormitory for a bit. You go ahead first.

289
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,530
All right.

290
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,280
We're departing!

291
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,860
Let's go!

292
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,120
National Police University

293
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,270
Excuse me, Professor.

294
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,090
Let's investigate Ahjussi Park Cheol Jin too.

295
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,720
Just like last time with Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil,

296
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,070
if it's not him, it'll be a big relief. Let's just make it clear this time too—

297
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:49,090
I thought I said it wasn't Cheol Jin.

298
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,980
Give me your cell phone.

299
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,530
Professor Yu Dong Man

300
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,680
Do you want to delete one contact?
Delete.

301
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,850
You stay out of this investigation.

302
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,930
Are you doing this because I said let's investigate Ahjussi Park Cheol Jin?

303
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,450
Shouldn't you first ask me why I think this—

304
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,950
You write your speculations in your own report.

305
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,990
Don't you understand what I'm saying?!

306
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,920
Don't come to my office, either.

307
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:34,710
Now the only place that you and I are going to meet is in the classroom.

308
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,250
Is this it?

309
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,990
The partner you've been talking about?

310
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,980
The investigation that you never gave up on?

311
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,950
Is this it?

312
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,460
You were scared.

313
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,410
Isn't this what you wanted to hear?

314
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,960
Do you think that's enough to break it?

315
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,910
Bus
National Police University

316
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,820
Well ... Why didn't you take the shuttle bus?

317
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,230
Why did you lie to me?

318
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:19,460
I wanted to kick you, but instead, I took it out on the poor trash bin.

319
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,710
You take the next bus!

320
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,040
It's a quick checkup at the hospital, so do you want to get some pork belly, soju, and beer when I get back?

321
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,990
Hurry up and go, you punk. There will be traffic because it's the weekend.

322
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,420
But Mentor, what's going on?

323
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,950
- Why?
- It's just that

324
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,330
you look like someone with a broken heart.

325
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,820
I will be back.

326
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,990
You were scared. Isn't this what you wanted to hear?

327
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,910
- Are you going somewhere?
- Ah, you scared me.

328
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,750
Yes, I'm going somewhere.

329
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,230
Where? Oh, it's alcohol.

330
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,230
I'm not in the mood for puns.

331
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,360
Are you going to drink soju? With who? A woman?

332
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,270
Are you always so interested in people, or are you just like this with me?

333
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,830
Just with you.

334
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,220
Wow. You're dangerous.

335
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,420
You're a really dangerous woman.

336
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,270
What kind of woman is she? Is she prettier than me?

337
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,450
That isn't possible, though.

338
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,710
If you're curious, then get in.

339
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,750
Are you crazy?

340
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,530
How many years have you worked at the National Police University?

341
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,920
It'll be seven or eight years, this year. Around there.

342
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,910
Was Gossi Beer there since then?

343
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,170
No, it just opened out of the blue.

344
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,760
That place was always like that.

345
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,760
The owner changed often and the type of business changed often.

346
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,730
But strangely enough, Professor Go's place has been hanging on for a long time.

347
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:46,720
He also quickly became friends with the people in the neighborhood.

348
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
But why are you asking about that?

349
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,080
I think we need to buy ramen too.

350
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,570
Where the hell are we going?

351
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,640
You really want to be kicked, don't you?

352
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,760
Just kick me once.

353
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,190
If it'll make you feel better, feel free to kick me. I'll take everything.

354
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,410
But, Kang Hui, let's go to the trial together—

355
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,620
Hold on. Hold on.

356
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,760
The first outing I've been waiting for,

357
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,570
and I even wore my uniform without knowing I was coming to my mom's trial.

358
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,430
I'm feeling pretty shitty right now.

359
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,200
So don't follow me.

360
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,430
Or I'm really going to break your leg then.

361
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,600
Wait ... Kang Hui ...

362
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,870
Trial in session.

363
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,880
All the evidence points to the defendant's involvement in the gambling enterprise.

364
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,410
Are you saying the defendant doesn't admit it?

365
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:13,600
Oh, the ... The defendant is pleading guilty.

366
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,490
Didn't you appeal because you didn't admit it?

367
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,630
That's what I'm saying. I will do it. I will.

368
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,520
Look here, prosecutor. I admit that I've gambled,

369
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,660
Ma'am. They told me I had to make a coin account, or whatever it is,

370
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,960
to make bets.

371
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,220
I don't know what that is, so I asked the samchun to do it for me.

372
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,060
So that's why the samchun made the coin account for me.

373
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,780
I played a few games with it and lost all my money.

374
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,850
I mean, I lost that money and quit.

375
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,270
But how would I go and open up a gambling place?

376
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,840
I don't even have the ability to do that!

377
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,050
The prosecution would like to call a witness.

378
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,190
Witness stand

379
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,470
She definitely said so,

380
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,300
that she was working with people in the Philippines to run an illegal gambling site

381
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,010
and that the money was flowing in.

382
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,580
Hey, you b****! Even if your mouth is crooked you should speak properly.

383
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,900
If I was really doing that, why would I run with all that money in the night?

384
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,270
Is my daughter a crazy b**** to beg for someone else to feed her for the rest of her life?

385
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,790
Be quiet! Quiet!

386
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,060
And witness, please spit out your gum.

387
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,800
- Yes, sir.
- You two. You guys lined up your stories to put it all on me, didn't you?

388
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,330
Miss Oh Jeong Ja.

389
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,480
You told me your name was Oh Ga Eul.

390
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,820
Why did you call my name as you wish?

391
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,800
Do we not have rights?

392
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,820
Hey, you... You were going to blame it on me from the start

393
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,980
and close this case!

394
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,600
Even if I look sophisticated, I'm a woman who's seen the worst that this world has to offer.

395
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,310
You were bribed, weren't you? Who gave you the money?

396
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,200
Who uses the law like this?

397
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,130
Let go! Hey, you! Just you wait!

398
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,480
I'll get you!

399
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,420
Let's go out.

400
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,130
Let's not watch this, let's just go out.

401
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,990
No, watch it, Kang Hui.

402
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,980
Only you know if your mom is speaking the truth or not, Kang Hui.

403
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,210
So you have to watch it till the end.

404
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,910
- Hey, Kang Seon Ho, let go of her hand.
- You take your hands off her.

405
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,370
What are you guys doing after we came all the way here?

406
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,920
Let go.

407
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,040
Defendant, please sit down. Prosecutor, please give your closing statement.

408
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,530
Let go.

409
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,860
Just the amount of betting money in the illegal gambling site created under the defendant's name

410
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,000
is estimated to be tens of billions of won.

411
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:07,020
Also, her accomplice, Kim Soon Ae, acknowledged her actions and withdrew the appeal,

412
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,100
whereas Defendant Oh Jeong Ja, who already has similar priors,

413
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,850
is making excuses rather than showing remorse in this courtroom.

414
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,040
Therefore, for habitual gambling and setting up a gambling site,

415
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,460
and for the violation of the Electronic Financial Transactions Act,

416
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,410
the original verdict of two years in prison and 500 million won in fine is reasonable.

417
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,360
I ask the court for the dismissal of her appeal.

418
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,000
After the defense counsel's closing argument, we will close today's hearing.

419
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,650
Counsel.

420
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,500
Your Honor,

421
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,490
I admit to all my crimes.

422
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,380
Gambling? I did so.

423
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,920
I will get punished for it.

424
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:03,110
But, I won't get punished for what I haven't done.

425
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,040
Establishing a gambling site?

426
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,560
I promise on my daughter's life that I haven't done such a thing.

427
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,400
Gamble
Money

428
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:52,300
It's simple. The money people use for betting on this site is all saved as cryptocurrency.

429
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,320
It's the same website.

430
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,490
GAMBLE
MONEY

431
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,240
Yu Dong Man

432
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,660
Ah, right.

433
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,410
You're having fun, aren't you?

434
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,290
- What?
- It's your specialty to act cool and then run away when no one's looking, isn't it?

435
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,760
I did at least watch the trial till the end because of you guys.

436
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,680
Thank you.

437
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,080
But, go now.

438
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,750
I want to stop being embarrassed.

439
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,910
You really aren't different from a puppy.

440
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,370
Sit down. Your legs will hurt.

441
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,130
My mom

442
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,040
wasn't lying.

443
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,780
She really didn't do it.

444
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,220
I know how she lies when she does.

445
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,130
When I was seven,

446
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:17,220
I asked her why I don't have a dad when everyone else does.

447
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,540
She avoided my eyes and told me

448
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,900
that my dad was earning money abroad.

449
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,560
When I was 13, I asked her if she was going to prison again and

450
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,220
she avoided my eyes again and said

451
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
that she wasn't going.

452
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,950
But she went.

453
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,140
That's when I found out

454
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,970
that when my mom doesn't look at my eyes

455
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,080
she's lying.

456
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,140
But earlier she looked me in the eye properly.

457
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,730
It isn't my mom.

458
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm only asking you because I just don't get it.

459
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,990
Why did you come here?

460
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,150
I wonder too.

461
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,820
Because I am lonely.

462
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,290
Why would you come here when you're lonely?

463
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,630
I wonder too.

464
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,900
I am extremely lonely.

465
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,330
Your close mentee came too.

466
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,910
Why did you leave him and come?

467
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,040
Hey, when people are extremely lonely,

468
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,220
they usually find people they aren't close with.

469
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,810
The closer we are, the less we can let them know how we feel,

470
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,750
and there are times when we can't tell them anything.

471
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,840
- Oh?
- Here.

472
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,380
You said I can't try it because it is expensive.

473
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,320
Have it till I come back from the restroom.

474
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,700
Damn it. Am I getting old?

475
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,080
What is it? Why are you weak? What happened?

476
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,780
It's just that

477
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,300
I spat it all knowing I'd regret it,

478
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,900
sheesh I already regret it.

479
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,630
Why did you do so when you knew you were going to regret it?

480
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,530
So that I don't regret it later.

481
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,640
You are strange. I don't know well,

482
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,030
but why are you scared? It's unlike you.

483
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,350
It just became so now that I have something to protect.

484
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,960
I'm getting scared of living.

485
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,700
Ah, what kind of a woman is she? Is she prettier than me?

486
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,780
Sunbae!

487
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:53,110
No-No Beom Tae?

488
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,890
What?

489
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,220
Jo Jun Wuk?

490
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,630
Why... why... why are you here?

491
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,850
I have a date with Noona.

492
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,400
How could you not tell me about it?

493
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,460
You're the one who didn't tell me.

494
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,150
Hey, what is the problem?

495
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,360
You also wanted to meet me. He also wanted to meet me.

496
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,530
So I thought all three of us could meet. That's why we are here as three people.

497
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,000
Here. Drink up.

498
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,900
- Thank you.
- Cheers!

499
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,910
Hey, was this the date you were talking about?

500
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,580
What? You said you don't have secrets from me.

501
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,460
What are you doing? Won't you drink?

502
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,310
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly! Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!

503
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,800
How much you drink isn't important when it comes to alcohol.

504
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,950
The speed is important.

505
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,620
Drink up.

506
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,950
Cheers!

507
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,890
Even the standing room tickets were sold out for the last bus to Asan.

508
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,990
- There are no more tickets.
- What?

509
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,120
No, it's really okay.

510
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,610
It will be fine if I catch the first bus in the morning and go.

511
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:27,470
How will you wait till the first bus in the morning runs?

512
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,900
Let's just go together, Kang Hui.

513
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,740
Your drink is here.

514
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,540
- Have a nice time.
- Thank you.

515
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,800
I'll just have one more drink.

516
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,130
I'll go home after this one drink.

517
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,630
You really don't have to buy such things.

518
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,650
My mom told me not to go empty-handed while going to others' homes.

519
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,890
- Hey, Kang Hui.
- Hm.

520
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,020
You and Min Gyu...

521
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,800
No, never mind.

522
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,030
What about me and Min Gyu?

523
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,640
I wondered if you guys were dating.

524
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,280
Are you crazy? Why would I date a friend?

525
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,860
Where is it?

526
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,530
It's here. We're almost there.

527
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,080
Here.

528
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,480
Father.

529
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,000
Hello!

530
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,760
Is he inside? Wait a moment.

531
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,930
Father.

534
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,460
Father?

535
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,380
Did he go somewhere?

536
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,300
Fathe—

537
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,860
Father!

538
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,740
Hey, Kang Seon Ho. Hey!

539
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,650
- Hey!
- Father!

540

541
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,000
What are you doing?

542
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,390
Hey, Kang Seon Ho.

543
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,970
- Father, Father!
- Hey, Kang Seon Ho.

544
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,020
- Father.
- What's wrong?

545
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,900
What's wrong?

546
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,130
Hey! What's wrong?

547
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:11,990
My father...

548
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,510
Father isn't home.

549
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,370
He could have gone out for a while.

550
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,090

553
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,070
So they were siblings.

554
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,280
Change into these.

555
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,220
I'll help you father.

556
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:14,140
It's okay. Show your girlfriend around the house.

557
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,670
Sh-She isn't my girlfriend.

558
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:27,020
Aren't there any pictures of Seon Ho when he was a child?

559
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,230
There are only photos of him from when he was older.

560
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,780
We moved a lot so we don't

561
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,370
have any pictures of him when he was a child

562
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,640
Ah, it's the same case for me.

563
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,150
Where do I change clothes?

564
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,000
In this room.

565
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,480
But why was the master bedroom like that?

566
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,460
It was such a mess.

567
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,260
Ah, well, I didn't know what clothes to wear so...

568
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,140
I wanted to wear something neat.

569
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,210
Hey, I forgot to press the button.

570
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,950
I'll go buy some instant rice.

571
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,530
Please sit down.

572
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,320
It looks tasty.

573
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,530
Leave it. You can just sit down.

574
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,070
That is harder. Just let me do it.

575
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,340
And you can talk to me casually so that

576
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,080
I can eat happily without getting indigestion.

577
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,020
My Seon Ho is just nice,

578
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,810
- so I don't know if he's fun to be around.
- Pardon?

579
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,330
Not at all! He is nice,

580
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,980
but he's tenacious, and he doesn't show it even when he's panicked.

581
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,010
He says what he has to say, so he has a lot of friends too.

582
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,810
- Is that so?
- Yes.

583
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,730
So I was a bit startled earlier.

584
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,290
It was my first time seeing him like that.

585
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,740
He was flustered and didn't know what to do.

586
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,930
Like a five-year-old kid who lost his dad.

587
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,540
I was always afraid that he would disappear on me.

588
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,150
He says he's all grown up now.

589
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,750
When he was little, he was like a wind chime.

590
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,030
He was there when I thought he wasn't,

591
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,810
and not there when I assumed he was.

592
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,750
That's how he was.

593
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,370
When I saw him today, he was right there.

594
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:42,380
He's no longer like the wind chime.

595
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,040
Seon Ho's presence is always felt by everyone.

596
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,850
He stands out wherever he goes.

597
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,750
I'm home.

598
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,110
Let's eat first.

599
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,460
Hey, hurry up, I'm hungry.

600
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,950
I think I ate too much.

601
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,050
I'm so full.

602
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,670
Sorry for taking your room away. I'll excuse myself for today.

603
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,790
What are you looking at?

604
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,730
- Go out quickly.
- Yes.

605
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,080
Good... Good night.

606
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:19,820
It looks exactly like a monk's desk.

Yun Taek Il?

611
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,290
Aren't there any pictures of Seon Ho when he was a child?

612
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,440
There are only photos of him from when he was older.

613
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,100
Oh, that's ...

614
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,120
We moved a lot

615
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,320
so we don't have any pictures of him when he was a child.

616
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,710
Is that why he was like a wind chime.

617
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,620
In my eyes too?

618
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,480
Do you like her that much?

619
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,490
Why are you so surprised, punk?

620
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,990
No, it's just that ... we're just friends.

621
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,130
What are you talking about?

622
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:25,990
Hey, whatever her feelings are, you need to figure out where you guys stand.

623
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,620
All right.

624
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:38,010
By the way, Father.

625
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:41,050
You told me,

626
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:46,120
the things that happened before I became a police officer, I could repay you by living from now on.

627
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,760
I did.

628
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,130
What if something dangerous

629
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,650
happens while I am paying you back?

630
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:01,920
What if I can't protect the people that I care about

631
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,070
by doing that?

632
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,550
That thought really scares me.

633
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:12,220
It terrifies me. My head is telling me I shouldn't do it,

634
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,340
and that I don't need to do it,

635
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,340
but ...

636
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,170
But you want to do it.

637
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,590
Then you have to do it.

638
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:27,540
For someone who has held himself back his whole life, is worrying this much,

639
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,890
and thinking a lot about it, then it's right for you to do it.

640
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:42,080
So do it. But if you're going to do it, do it right.

641
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,590
Wouldn't that make you a good police officer,

642
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,640
who protects the people he cares about in the future?

643
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:57,700
I always believe in the choices my son makes.

644
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,880
How about analyzing the pattern of the locations?

645
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,510
There is a program that figures out call patterns and frequency.

646
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:34,880
If we investigate using that, I think we'll be able to figure out the actual phone call locations.

647
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,260
I did it.

648
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:04,340
Is that investigation still ongoing?

649
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,540
Yes, well, because I haven't caught the culprit yet.

650
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:12,020
Are you doing the investigation with Kang Seon Ho?

651
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,410
Why are you surprised? It looks like that's exactly what's going on.

652
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:21,000
I was just ... teaching him.

653
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,440
Not anymore.

654
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,170
That's why you're feeling lonely.

655
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,580
Just because it's an investigation,

656
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:35,810
if the damn guy right next to you is suspicious, you have to start suspecting him first.

657
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,850
Even if it's really unfair and lonely,

658
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:42,090
you have to do it.

659
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:44,780
Is that why you even suspected me?

660
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:52,940
Just as there is an end to fishing, there's probably an end to that investigation.

661
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:58,230
At the end of this investigation, I don't know what I'm going to find, who will be involved,

662
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,320
or what's going to happen.

663
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,420
I'm a bit scared.

664
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:09,650
When that happens, you have to hang in there, and that's why you have friends.

665
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,060
What I'm saying is, come here if you're lonely, whenever you need to.

666
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,060
You caught something.

667
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,690
What?

668
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:34,030
Oh my. Oh my. What am I supposed to do?

669
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,320
- A fish! A fish!
- Wow!

670
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,090
Take out the fish for me!

671
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:58,300
Your father seemed like a good man.

672
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,700
You grew up well.

673
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,290
Anyway, it's a secret that I slept at your house.

674
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:09,280
It'll only turn to gossip when we aren't even dating.

675
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,940
Kang Hui.

676
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:19,620
I'll catch the real culprit in your mother's case.

677
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:24,310
I will put everything back where it should be.

678
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:30,580
I'm actually ... working with Professor Yu Dong Man on an investigation.

679
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:34,170
What?

680
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:39,150
I couldn't run at the Cheongram Sports Festival because of that investigation.

681
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,290
What are you investigating?

682
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:46,780
I mean, is that related to my mother's case?

683
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,630
That ...

684
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:53,780
I will talk with the professor and tell you.

685
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,720
I'm going to make a deal with the professor today.

686
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,720
A deal?

687
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,050
Yes.

688
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:05,950
Also, when I'm done with the professor, you're next.

689
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:10,190
Let's come to a resolution regarding our relationship now.

690
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:21,240
Yu Dong Man

691
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,890
Yes, I'll go there now.

692
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,840
Did you get any fingerprints?

693
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,960
Yes, I did, but ...

694
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,640
that was ...

695
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:54,850
Forensic Science Investigation Room

696
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,760
The fingerprints on this laptop

697
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,540
don't match the remote that you brought me,

698
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,400
but they match this plastic cup.

699
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:17,130
It's just that you look like someone with a broken heart.

700
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,900
I will be back.

701
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,000
Mentor!

702
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,650
Professor.

703
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:15,820
I can't drop out of this investigation.

704
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:19,750
No. I won't drop out.

705
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,690
I heard that there is a criminal at the National Police University.

706
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:25,530
Hey. How did you...

707
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:29,220
I really need to catch that criminal.

708
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,810
So,

709
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:37,130
all those who are precious to me, I must protect them.

710
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:46,150
I've made my decision. Now it's time for you to make your decision, Professor.

711
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:51,870
I have to see this investigation through to the end.

712
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,030
Mentor.

713
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,430
♫ When things don't go as they should, tell me ♫

714
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:22,680
♫ When you think you're going to fall, hold me ♫

715
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,350
♫ When everyone leave you, Tell me ♫

716
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:35,750
♫ I'll be there for you, Hold me ♫

717
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:45,130
♫ What do you think? ♫

718
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,660
Police University
♫ I'll be at your side. Hold me ♫

719
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:52,860
You aren't doing any personal work with Kang Seon Ho, right?

720
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,190
Ahjussi was the one who did it, right?

721
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:56,470
To be honest, whether it happened because of a sting operation

722
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,500
or you're putting up an act, we don't know!

723
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,080
Is that what you really think?

724
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,480
Do you guys know what this is?

725
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,470
I received a report.

726
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:08,140
The thing that's making its way around among the student seems like the final exam for criminal investigation class.

727
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:11,000
You can't get out of this one when the money envelope was found in the room!

728
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,230
The arrest warrant will be issues soon.

729
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:13,610
You will have to hurry.

730
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:16,260
We'll be able to save Professor Yu Dong Man, right?

731
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,160
I'm going to save your mentor.

732
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,800
♫ It will unfold in front of us. ♫
