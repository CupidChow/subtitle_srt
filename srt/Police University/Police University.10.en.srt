00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,290
Episode 10

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,360
It's Yu Dong Man.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,360
You asked me that question last time.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,000
Are you going to be a professor or a detective?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,280
You said I had to choose.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,070
To be honest, I thought it wouldn't be that bad to become a professor.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,830
But I was actually learning from the students,

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,880
embarrassingly.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,390
I thought it would be better to catch people

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,450
who were less than me than to teach those who are better than me.

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:50,200
So, I'm going back to being a detective, instead of being a professor.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,140
Professor Yu Dong Man

13
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,110
Professor's Office

14
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,300
It can't be.

15
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,080
Professor ...

16
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,870
Seon Ho.

17
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,450
Is Professor Yu really not there?

18
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,560
He left this behind.

19
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,730
If you see him, please tell him this,

20
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,790
it takes one week to process a resignation.

21
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,190
Professor Seo Sang Hak,

22
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,120
please take care of our losers.

23
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,120
Like a 20-year old, go fall in love, travel, and fight a little bit.

24
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,180
I'm telling you to live your life while having some fun, punk.

25
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,390
Life isn't only about investigating.

26
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,510
Professor Yu Dong Man

27
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,840
The call cannot be answered.

28
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,820
I didn't call to stop a professor who ran away, so just listen to this.

29
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,190
The burner phone that was contacting Park Cheol Jin

30
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,950
turned on. The location came up as well.

31
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:04,780
If it's now, we can catch those illegal gambling bastards,

32
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,710
so please call me.

33
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,110
Or answer your phone!

34
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,530
That burner phone

35
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,510
is the one who put this all on my mom, right?

36
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,950
I knew it ... I kept thinking it was weird.

37
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,470
I mean, Seon Ho was going out every night.

38
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,210
We've been saying over and over that we don't have secrets among us!

39
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,330
You liar!

40
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,220
Let's go for now. I heard the GPS is on.

41
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,790
Okay.

42
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,880
- Let's go to Beom Tae's house first.
- What?

43
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,120
The KIT (Kang Investigation Team) has standards. We can't take a taxi.

44
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,780
KIT?

45
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,130
An investigation team led by Kang Seon Ho.

46
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,270
Kang - Investigation - Team! Don't you remember?

47
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,740
The heroes of the leaked final exam incident, they're us!

48
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,180
Hero!

49
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,530
- Okay. Let's go!
- Let's go!

50
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,980
Let's go!

51
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,840
Get up.

52
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,570
- Kang Hui.
- You'll get sick if you hold it in.

53
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,890
I can't bear to see that.

54
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,390
I know you're very angry inside and upset.

55
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,620
So go meet the professor and say whatever you want to say.

56
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,220
"How can you do this without saying anything to me?"

57
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,610
"Leaving like this isn't right!" "Are you that great?" "Is being a professor everything?"

58
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,350
And where do you think the professor would have gone after writing his resignation?

59
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,960
He probably went to catch the criminal.

60
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,480
The professor must be where the criminal is, right?

61
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,840
Let's go.

62
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,890
Why don't you stop?

63
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,120
Why do you keep calling someone who won't answer?

64
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,040
So that Professor Yu can call back whenever he wants to.

65
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,910
It wouldn't be easy for someone who ran away without saying goodbye to call.

66
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,240
He would be embarassed.

67
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,720
So that's why I'm giving him the chance first.

68
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,800
He can decide to come back since I left a trace,

69
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,270
or at least call.

70
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,480
Where the hell did he go?

71
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,360
Who is that?

72
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,840
He's an old customer.

73
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,190
But what kind of fishing is he going to do

74
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,710
when he stays inside all day?

75
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,940
- Isn't he like a wanted criminal?
- Come on.

76
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,700
No way.

77
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,540
Ay, no way!

78
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,690
Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil missed call
Kang Seon Ho 18 missed calls
Professor Choi Hui Su 12 missed calls
Professor Seo Sang Hak 2 missed calls

79
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,610
Police University
21st, noon
20th, travels to Police University

80
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,750
The main route of Go Deok Bae

81
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,920
I watched you for 48 hours,

82
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,390
but suddenly I can't even find you?

83
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,220
Go Deok Bae, that fat bastard.

84
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,140
Where the hell are you hiding?

85
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,600
Yes, go ahead.

86
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,190
Sunbae!

87
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,490
Money Exchange

88
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,060
Yes, I'm here.

89
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,360
That is ...

90
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,400
The last location where the burner phone was turned off was in Changrim-dong.

91
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,380
- If it's Changrim-dong, isn't that where a lot of foreigners are?
- Yes.

92
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,390
Professor Yu is probably there.

93
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,360
This is definitely the GPS's last location.

94
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,170
There are more alleyways than I thought.

95
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,430
Hey, then, let's split up in pairs and look for him.

96
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,710
No, Beom Tae and I will go this way.

97
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,110
Wait, but still, it's a bit—

98
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,340
It's okay. It's daytime and there are a lot of people.

99
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,430
You two look on the main road.

100
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,300
I'll call you if we find Professor Yu Dong Man.

101
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,340
- Let's go.
- We'll see you later.

102
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,990
Later.

103
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,630
But do you think the real culprit is here?

104
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,580
We did follow him here, but I don't even know what to do.

105
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,060
What would the professor have done?

106
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,030
Honestly, I really hate the professor.

107
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:23,250
He turned himself in, he left the school,

108
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,650
and he doesn't care about the promise he made to me. I really hate him for doing things his way.

109
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,010
Still, I wish he were here.

110
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,530
Should we go for now?

111
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,840
Republic of Korea
Passport

112
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,280
Oh! It's you, Professor Go!

113
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,570
Gossi Beer was closed during vacation. Didn't you go on a trip?

114
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,060
A-Are you all right?

115
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,340
I-I-I was surprised. Seeing you guys here.

116
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,490
I know! How could we meet right here?

117
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,480
But what are you doing here?

118
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,230
H-Here?

119
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,350
Oh, there's a special sauce here I came to buy.

120
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,950
But what are you guys doing in this neighborhood?

121
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,250
- Oh, we—
- My colleague

122
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,070
Mi No lives in this neighborhood.

123
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,660
We came here to eat with him and then head back.

124
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,880
Oh, is that so?

125
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,580
If you go there, in that corner, there are many good restaurants.

126
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,080
All right! Thank you! See you after school starts!

127
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,800
- All right. Eat and head home, all right?
- Bye.

128
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,060
What's wrong? I was going to ask if he saw Professor Yu Dong Man.

129
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,460
I mean... he seemed a little strange.

130
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,640
Even his clothes and his bag.

131
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,500
Give me your phone.

132
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,680
Sunbae! Professor Go's car was spotted in the foreigner neighborhood of Changlim-dong.

133
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,910
Did this jerk already leave?

134
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,930
Damn it. Why would he come to the foreigner neighborhood?

135
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,600
I know, why did it he have to come here out of all places?

136
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,150
That's what I'm saying. It's not like he came here to sightsee.

137
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,720
What's in this area?

138
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,550
Well ... they have tacos, pho, curry,

139
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,100
I wasn't talking about that.

140
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,860
Then what else?

141
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,050
Well, there must be a lot of foreigners, so there are banks or

142
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,260
currency exchange places, you punk.

143
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,260
What is that... that... that place that specializes in exchanging foreign currency.

144
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,690
Exchanging currency?

145
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,990
Oh, currency exchange store! That's right, a currency exchange store!

146
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,500
Because you're lonely, you're doing all the talking.

147
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,390
Huh?

148
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,330
Now I'm seeing things, I'm going crazy.

149
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,950
Oh!

150
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,050
Professor Go ... the culprit?

151
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,970
No, he's not. He can't be.

152
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,370
- He's not, right?
- I don't know.

153
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,810
He could really be here for groceries.

154
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,500
Groceries? Gossi Beer was closed because of the school vacation.

155
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,260
This is a homemade listening device, and it has a maximum transmission range of 3 kilometers.

156
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,120
Is there any other punk other than that Mr. Go jerk, who could have been eavesdropping within that range?

157
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,550
You don't know that!

158
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,790
Professor Yu Dong Man was right.

159
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,300
What do you mean?

160
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,160
Which way did Professor Go disappear?

161
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,260
That alleyway.

162
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,860
Let's go there for now, quickly.

163
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,530
What are you guys doing here?

164
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,360
Professor!

165
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,020
Is it okay if we stay in here?

166
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,810
Hey, didn't you see the professor's fierce eyes?

167
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,850
- You're right. It's better if we just wait here.
- Yes.

168
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,930
Aren't you going to answer me? What are you doing here?!

169
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,210
Then what are you doing here?

170
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,230
What, you punk?!

171
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,250
Professor Go is the culprit, right?

172
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,870
How... How do you know that?

173
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,990
The burner phone that was used to communicate with Ahjussi Cheol Jin turned on.

174
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:35,460
I followed that phone's GPS and ran into Professor Go here.

175
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,990
What?!

176
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,430
H-How can you say that so... simply?

177
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,570
No, no, no. So, you ran into him?

178
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,960
Who did? You?

179
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,880
No, not me but Beom Tae and Jun Wuk.

180
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,430
You punk! Did you completely forget how Cheol Jin got hurt?

181
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,730
You dared to come here and you even brought your friends?

182
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,690
If you were worried about that, then you shouldn't have left!

183
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,790
If you hadn't left, we wouldn't have come all the way here

184
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,300
looking for you.

185
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,540
You trusted Ahjussi Cheol Jin and waited for him.

186
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,060
Now I can be by your side.

187
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,090
How can I trust you when you're like this?

188
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,430
Hey, today, because you didn't know whether it was real or crap,

189
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,780
you lost that jerk, Professor Go.

190
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,790
Do you think I've just been watching him because I couldn't catch him?

191
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,460
Do you know how many days and nights, I spent trying to get the right evidence

192
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,870
and arrest him, you frustrating punk?!

193
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,530
Just take your friends and go home.

194
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,260
Was I even your partner?

195
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,800
Answer me. Don't run away.

196
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,310
This punk!

197
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,570
Answer me, Ahjussi.

198
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,050
What?! Ahju—

199
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,830
What? You're not a professor at the National Police University anymore.

200
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,290
Hey, Kang Seon Ho!

201
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,100
The Investigation exam. Last answer. The most important thing in an investigation!

202
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,930
I put 'partner' as my answer! Because that's what I learned!

203
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,160
Partner

204
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,070
I've only learned that for half a year.

205
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,200
Now, that's useless too.

206
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,160
Hey ... Hey, punk!

207
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,720
Whoa.

208
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,070
Professor Seo Sang Hak said he will accept your resignation in one week.

209
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,430
I'm really going to mind my own business now, so do what you want.

210
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,630
Wait a minute.

211
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,720
My back ...

212
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,430
My back went out. My back ...

213
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,200
Your back?

214
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,280
Are you all right?

215
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,940
- Should we go to the hospital?
- I really wasn't expecting that.

216
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,000
I think I have a herniated disc.

217
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,670
I-I'm sorry, Professor.

218
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,210
Am I not an ahjussi now, but back to a professor?

219
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,860
I mean, it's because I was so mad earlier.

220
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,430
So why are you resigning and investigating without telling me

221
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,630
when you're the one that called me your partner?

222
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,250
Oh, my back, my back.

223
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,330
Even now, shouldn't we go to the hospital?

224
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,860
Forget it, punk. Just follow the navigation.

225
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:41,360
If you got here this fast, what does that make me?

226
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,720
It must be embarrassing.

227
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,280
But what was that? Why?

228
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,990
Can't you be a little embarrassed?

229
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,320
I've been embarrassed countless times.

230
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,020
I've been embarrassed because I am young. I've been embarrassed because I don't know anything.

231
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,690
Whenever you do things like this, as if you don't care about me,

232
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,780
I think to myself, "Was I the only one who thought we were partners?"

233
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,260
I was really embarrassed.

234
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,600
So this is my last time, too.

235
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,550
If you do this again, then I really ...

236
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,750
won't see you again.

237
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,170
Wow, you're really scary.

238
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,550
I'm serious.

239
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,170
I'm serious too, punk.

240
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,910
Seriously...

241
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,660
After I heard something about a wanted criminal, I felt very nervous.

242
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,340
So I looked at him secretly, and after seeing his face, I realized it was that man.

243
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,480
The professor from the National Police University, who came here a couple of times.

244
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,840
I'm glad you called us. Where is he?

245
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,450
He's on the second floor here.

246
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,710
He went out and hasn't come back yet, but you can go up there.

247
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,600
- Thank you.
- No problem.

248
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,160
He really came here when he felt lonely.

249
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,660
Illegal gambling site opening and closing log.

250
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,840
What is all this?

251
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,190
Professor Go?

252
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,970
Welcome.

253
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,260
What about Park Cheol Jin's things?

254
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,250
I already received them.

255
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,890
But Detective Bae, that jerk loves money so much, I'm tired of him.

256
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,490
It doesn't matter. We can just cut him off.

257
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,640
There are no problems with the preparations for the event, right?

258
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,360
It's not my first time. If you want to take a sabbatical, we have to go big one more time.

259
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,220
Why did you follow us when I told you to go home?

260
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,550
I need to investigate this too.

261
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:57,590
It's not like it's a stranger. It involves my mom. And now that I know who the culprit is

262
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,360
I can't turn back.

263
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,770
I have to catch that culprit myself.

264
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,000
My head hurts.

265
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,670
Jun Wuk and I ran into Professor Go.

266
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,580
Yes! We're in danger

267
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,630
now that he knows about us.

268
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,470
We can't go home like this and put our family in danger.

269
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,340
This is driving me crazy.

270
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,080
Why the hell are you guys doing this to me?

271
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,460
What are all of you talking about?

272
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,550
Let's talk, Professor Yu.

273
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,520
What were all those findings in your room?

274
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,210
Why would you go into someone else's room and look through it?

275
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,190
Is the owner of Gossi Beer really part of the illegal gambling team?

276
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,050
Yes, well...

277
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,240
So, the students followed him and met Professor Go?

278
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,460
Yes, well...

279
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,370
What the hell were you thinking?

280
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,890
Why are you yelling?

281
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,760
Didn't I resign to prevent this from happening?

282
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,340
Are you saying you did nothing wrong right now?

283
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,670
I'm not saying that, but it's because you suddenly started yelling.

284
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,170
- That's enough from both of you.
- If you decided to become a professor, you shouldn't have been investigating!

285
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,120
What are you going to do now with those students running around trying to catch him?

286
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,160
That's why I resigned to just be a detective! I did everything I could too!

287
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,460
- I said that's enough.
- Forget that.

288
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,780
- What are you going to do now about those students?!
- I can just take responsibility for them!

289
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,260
How are you going to take responsibility for them?! What if they get hurt too?!

290
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,440
I said that's enough!

291
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,760
Is this the time to be like this?!

292
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,880
I just heard that the person who runs a business right in front of the National Police University is an illegal gambling operator!

293
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,550
Even the students are in danger. Do you really want to fight right now?!

294
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,550
- What about the police?
- We can't call the police.

295
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,430
Cheol Jin was even connected to this. There might be others we don't know about.

296
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,330
I told you I'm just going to take care of everything!

297
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,110
What are you going to take care of on your own? What? Are you going to work with the students?

298
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,240
We'll do it.

299
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,830
- What?
- Let's catch him.

300
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,330
Our students are in danger now.

301
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,330
Does that make sense?!

302
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,580
All right! I love you, Dad!

303
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,470
I told my family that I'm attending a seasonal class.

304
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,080
Okay.

305
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,040
But that isn't a lie.

306
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,830
To be honest, an investigation is a seasonal class.

307
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,900
Seon Ho, what about you? Did you call your family?

308
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,950
Yes, earlier.

309
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:46,460
But did the illegal gambling site start in front of the National Police University or before that?

310
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,000
I wonder.

311
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,020
He would have made a lot of money,

312
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,020
but why did he run Gossi Beer?

313
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,620
It's not in a place like Gangnam but in Asan of all places.

314
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,450
Who cares about a criminal's history?

315
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,960
He probably lost it from gambling.

316
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,150
Why aren't the professors coming?

317
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,480
I know some Hoobae police officers that I can trust—

318
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,460
I told you, you can't call the police!

319
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,470
We'll only get rid of the bottom player.

320
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,870
Then how are the three of us going to arrest him?!

321
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,650
Why is it just the three of us? Including the students, there are seven of us.

322
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:25,440
They're freshmen. They just barely got started!

323
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,440
Exactly, so we'll investigate with them and then the three of us can make the arrest.

324
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,410
What?

325
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,110
If it's difficult, you don't have to get involved.

326
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,540
I don't want to force you.

327
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,810
Professor Choi and I, I'm sure the two of us are enough to do it.

328
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,100
Professor Gwon.

329
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,970
I don't think this is right.

330
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,000
This never happened according to me.

331
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,570
We can catch him.

332
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,090
Our students are in danger.

333
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,490
Professor Gwon is right.

334
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,920
It doesn't make sense to do this with the students.

335
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,690
You're right. It's not protecting them,

336
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,830
but it could be putting them in more danger.

337
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,880
But isn't it better if you know about it?

338
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,410
I am going crazy because I couldn't see it.

339
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,760
Anyway, I'm saying I'm going to help. I think that is the right thing to do.

340
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,050
For both Professor Gwon and you,

341
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,500
tonight will be a long night.

342
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:10,300
♫ I who was unable to to hug ♫

343
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,850
♫ you who smiled at me when you saw me like that ♫

344
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:23,130
♫ From behind me getting farther away whether I keep reaching for you or not ♫

345
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,780
♫ To keep me warm and from getting hurt ♫

346
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,130
♫ So I wouldn’t see ♫

347
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:37,080
♫ Even the image of you hugging me who was crying ♫

348
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,100
♫  remains ♫

349
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,900
The most important thing in an investigation!

350
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,100
I put 'partner' as my answer!

351
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,610
Whenever you do things like this, as if you don't care about me,

352
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,250
I think to myself, "Was I the only one who thought we were partners?"

353
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,720
I was really embarrassed.

354
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,450
♫ Even the image of you hugging me who was crying ♫

355
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,820
♫ remains ♫

356
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,890
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, what about you?

357
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,270
Yes, I slept really well. The weather's really nice.

358
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,780
Hey!

359
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,110
Why are you lying there like that?

360
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,180
Such crap.

361
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,100
Ridiculous.

362
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,550
You shouldn't eat green colored food, bro.

363
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,300
But it's tasty.

364
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,950
Professor Choi Hui Su has decided to help you.

365
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,240
This is the plan for the investigation.

366
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,390
The investigation will always take place in teams of two.

367
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:41,880
Kang Seon Ho and I will start searching from Gossi Beer where Go Deok Bae was.

368
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,520
Professor Choi Hui Su and Oh Kang Hui.

369
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,440
Professor Choi Hui Su and Oh Kang Hui will—

370
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,650
We will look into the online gambling website.

371
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,690
Okay, fine.

372
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,740
What should Jun Wuk and I do?

373
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,050
We'll do anything, leader Yu.

374
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,120
Yes, leader.

375
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,420
Beom Tae and Jun Wuk will— Aish.

376
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:18,360
Those two will go with me.

377
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,980
Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil, Beom Tae, and Jun Wuk will

378
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,610
question people in Changrim-dong where Professor Go was seen

379
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,670
to find out why that jerk went there and what he did.

380
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:44,290
Right now, we only have a specific suspect but no leads or proof.

381
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:49,020
We need to find evidence that will enable us to arrest the suspect as soon as possible.

382
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,510
I hope you all show good teamwork and get the best results.

383
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,510
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

384
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,180
Changrim-dong.

385
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,710
So the real estate registry shows that there's a basement here, right?

386
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:20,040
That's right. It's a pub but its electricity use is at an industrial level.

387
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,130
That means he definitely did something here.

388
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,220
How do we check it?

389
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,700
Why? Are you going to prevent me from breaking in like last time?

390
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,660
No.

391
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:41,440
We have to put each and every one behind bars who insist on breaking the law.

392
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,190
Punk.

393
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,890
Was it around here where we ran into Professor Go?

394
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:59,090
There's only a currency exchange shop, so that must be it.

395
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,010
Then should we find out by pretending to be customers

396
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,900
what Professor Go bought in this neighborhood?

397
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,360
Sting operations are illegal.

398
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,720
What we have to do is an investigation through interrogation.

399
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,830
What do you think sting operations are?

400
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,950
- Student No Beom Tae.
- Pardon?

401
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,740
That is...

402
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,580
So sting operations are when you use a trap

403
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,260
to catch master criminals who are difficult to catch.

404
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,190
Then in what instances are sting operations allowed, Student Jo Jun Wuk?

405
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,070
Pardon?

406
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,510
To someone who intends to commit a crime,

407
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,140
providing an opportunity and environment is legal.

408
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,220
If you cause an innocent person to commit a crime

409
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,720
on purpose, that's illegal.

410
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,660
Yes. That's right.

411
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,680
We are now going to figure out what Professor Go bought from here.

412
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,900
Then the type of investigation we're going to carry out, is it a sting operation or interrogation?

413
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,130
Sting operation?

414
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,000
- Sting operation!
- Interrogation!

415
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:09,840
When I come back here, you both should give me the same answer.

416
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,660
And there should be proper reasoning for your reason. Wait here.

417
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,260
Yes, sir.

418
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,300
Which one is it? Is it interrogation?

419
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,250
Shall we go in together?

420
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,930
No. I'll go in by myself.

421
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:48,160
But do you really think your mom would know?

422
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,500
They change the site address dozens of times a day!

423
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,970
They open another one and then blow it up!

424
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,800
Do you think that is possible with my brain?

425
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,110
Yes. A thief knows another thief well.

426
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:06,370
And my mom knows them well.

427
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,350
I'll be back.

428
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,650
Reasons For ID Check

429
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,850
Hey! Would there be a basement there?

430
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:49,320
They are usually made very secretively.

431
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,130
Behind mirrors or...

432
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,790
Yes. Under carpets.

433
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,920
If you look right here, the floor...

434
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,990
So it's just a floor.

435
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,250
Hey! What is that?

436
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,480
What?

437
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,720
Hey! Sheesh!

438
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,890
Wow...

439
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,440
Wow! Look at these jerks.

440
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,170
They really did do it here.

441
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,880
How did they do it right in front of Police University?

442
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,210
Since it's the darkest under the lamp.

443
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,710
They would have moved their headquarters to a different place, right?

444
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,960
Of course.

445
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,700
Hey, do you think it's easy for people to stop gambling?

446
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,940
It's the first time you've seen me in a uniform. How come you're not saying anything?

447
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,570
What do you mean the first time? I already saw it during the trial.

448
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,620
- You saw?
- Of course.

449
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,600
You were glaring at me. How could I not see?

450
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,170
Forget that. I have something to ask you.

451
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,140
Do you remember what you said last time when I visited you?

452
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,030
The guys who did the illegal gambling website.

453
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,320
That they reopen sites and then close them down effortlessly.

454
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,050
Why, you b*tch? Why are you annoyingly asking me about that again?

455
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,930
I really have to know.

456
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,590
How do you know it is the same website if they reopen it?

457
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,920
You go. Go, you b*tch.

458
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:15,080
I'm in danger because I chased those guys from the illegal gambling website to solve your case.

459
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:31,620
So, you have to help me.

460
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,000
Which brainless jerk messed with my daughter?

461
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,400
Did they do that because they want me to be the end of their lives?

462
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,590
Even if Jesus or Buddha comes, no one can mess with Oh Jeong Ja's daughter!

463
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,020
I won't let that happen.

464
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,340
Why would you fight with God?

465
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,570
What's so great about them?

466
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:05,120
I will go against anyone who messes with you, whoever it is.

467
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,000
So, you too get your head together.

468
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,060
You are Oh Kang Hui, daughter of the vicious Oh Jeong Ja.

469
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,110
You are much smarter than me,

470
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,740
and much better than me!

471
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,330
What should I do for you?

472
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,640
Let's go.

473
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,340
It's me.

474
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,400
Don't you recognize my voice? I am Madam Oh.

475
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:26,100
Search and find out where that wench, Gumbler is within the hour.

476
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,450
These are things that took place at the Changrim-dong currency exchange shop.

477
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,290
Korean?

478
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,500
Money Exchange?

479
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,290
Got you.

480
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,830
Money laundering? Illegal foreign exchange transactions?

481
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,490
What's that?

482
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:53,180
According to Article 16 of the Foreign Exchange Control Act—

483
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,320
I feel sleepy.

484
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,680
Tell us what happened next quickly.

485
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,200
What do you want? Grab a loan?

486
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,640
I heard you guys provide other services.

487
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,860
Other services?

488
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,920
Yes, don't worry about the money.

489
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,500
Just name the price.

490
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,810
What does this jerk look like he wants?

491
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:22,000
A fake passport or a burner phone?

492
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,170
This jerk wouldn't be the police, right?

493
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,250
Hey, from which angle does he look like police?

494
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,420
With just a look I can say he's on our side.

495
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,220
Do you make fake passports and burner phones?

496
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,030
Are you Japanese?

497
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,130
A fake passport and burner phone?

498
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,770
Is that bastard trying to leave the country?

499
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,900
Yes. After making a killing first.

500
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,420
I spoke to my mom.

501
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,660
That Gumbler is a lady who stabbed my mom in the back.

502
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:59,350
Anyway, this ahjumma is a VIP of the illegal gambling website we are investigating.

503
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,290
And so?

504
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:04,610
They gave away invitations to the VIPs for the opening of the website.

505
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,100
They are hosting that opening event tomorrow night.

506
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,880
The chance of hitting the jackpot is twice as high.

507
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,930
Let's go and meet Gumbler.

508
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,700
Be careful.

509
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,830
Professor, just a moment.

510
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,990
I can trace the IP if I can just get access to the site.

511
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,780
If we can catch them in the act and figure out their address,

512
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,450
we can even arrest Professor Go on the spot.

513
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,010
Just spread rumors everywhere that you are a hacker.

514
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,470
Then what am I supposed to do?

515
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,950
There's that backtracking program Yoon made.

516
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,610
There is.

517
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:14,510
But that's an old program for backtracking accounts, so we'll have to recode it to backtrack an old IP address.

518
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,230
Then, it will take time.

519
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,260
How much?

520
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,530
About two days.

521
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,090
Do it by tomorrow.

522
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,910
Tomorrow? I said two days.

523
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,160
Do it as if it's a matter of life or death, then it will all work.

524
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,150
Even if we do it as if it's a matter of life or death it doesn't work like that here.

525
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,690
There will be a message with a link on that phone.

526
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,490
Check it and toss the phone safely.

527
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,130
Then what about you, Ahjumma?

528
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,660
It's just a phone, I can buy a new one.

529
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,630
You testified against my mom in the trial, right?

530
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,840
Then why are you helping us this much suddenly?

531
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:05,080
Your mom cried.

532
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,440
Children are the enemies.

533
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,850
You pay for the coffee.

534
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:37,420
It's fastest to do it here since I can use the LAN.

535
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,620
Okay.

536
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,880
Then, let's start.

537
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,580
Recipient : Seon Ho
Jackpot Chance VIP Link

538
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,030
Grand Open

539
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,200
That website hasn't opened yet.

540
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,650
But I can track them with this window, so I'll code the program and get their IP before they go live.

541
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,470
Then we will get the IP address and get their location,

542
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:02,540
and when they open the website, we go there immediately.

543
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,090
Yes.

544
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,800
Those jerks.

545
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,990
Professor Yu Dong Man and Seon Ho went to confirm something saying they'll come tomorrow.

546
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,490
So instead of waiting, go to sleep now.

547
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:31,680
Okay.

548
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,890
Ah, and that ahjumma is wrong.

549
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:40,230
- What?
- You aren't an enemy to your mom.

550
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:45,670
You're that one daughter in the saying, "One good daughter is better than ten sons."

551
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,620
So sleep confidently. Straighten your shoulders and smile to sleep.

552
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:55,260
You were very cool today and did very well.

553
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,130
Good night.

554
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,360
Living life is a worry.

555
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:20,550
We are sitting here to catch the guys who did illegal things right in this place.

556
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,510
I couldn't even imagine being in Police University with you

557
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,000
when you caught me and dragged me to the police station.

558
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,370
You will come back to the school when the investigation ends, right?

559
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,760
Depends on how you behave.

560
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,040
Why are you playing hard to get?

561
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,560
I won't even play hard to get if I don't like it.

562
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,020
What?

563
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,590
I'm not sleeping.

564
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:53,330
So don't slack off.

565
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,590
Data generation complete

566
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,600
Let's start everything.

567
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,790
Run the program?

568
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,340
Now, we just have to start?

569
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,950
Yes.

570
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,840
Would you like to run the program?
GRAND OPEN 6/24/ 21:00

571
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,780
North Korea
South Korea

572
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,560
There are two escape routes, this place and that one.

573
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,850
Then I can go to one place and Professor Choi can go to the other.

574
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,800
The time the website will be open is tonight at 21:00 hours (11 pm).

575
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,260
As soon as they go live, we're going to raid them.

576
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,690
- You four will monitor everything from here.
- What?

577
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,780
We don't go with you?

578
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:54,220
Information and speed are vital in cybercrime cases.

579
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,420
If the server or database goes offline or gets lost,

580
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,710
then the evidence will disappear and we can't catch the culprit.

581
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,420
Therefore, until the moment we apprehend him

582
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,950
you guys will keep monitoring from here and will let us know if there are any emergencies.

583
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:10,750
Okay.

584
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:15,290
But do we actually need four people to monitor?

585
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,160
Yes. I think we will need four people.

586
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,900
Yes.

587
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:25,470
Let's not make mistakes. Let's not be sloppy. Let's not let go of the culprit.

588
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,450
Tonight, we will definitely catch those guys.

589
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,370
Yes, sir.

590
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,160
Is it done?

591
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,930
The setting is over now.

592
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,170
The website will open six hours from now.

593
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:56,060
GRAND OPEN

594
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:03,430
But who got you the IP address?

595
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,530
There is someone.

596
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:09,360
I have been getting help from him since I was a police officer.

597
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,140
What about Professor Gwon?

598
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:15,310
He went outside to buy some dinner for the kids.

599
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:20,600
It must be hard for Professor Gwon, right?

600
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,980
Well, he is a person who follows the rules.

601
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:29,120
But he is taking all sorts of actions that break his rules and principles.

602
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:37,830
But do you think the person who did all that right in front of Police University

603
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:40,400
has something like rules?

604
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,650
Honestly, we came here in a hurry.

605
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:48,470
I feel like I'll be flustered when I see

606
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,330
Professor Go later tonight.

607
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,950
I do understand a little bit

608
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,320
how you felt seeing Cheol Jin.

609
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:10,930
After this work is over, let's go on the drive we were supposed to go on earlier.

610
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,530
Then make sure you don't even sprain your ankle

611
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:17,640
or get a scratch on your face.

612
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,820
Let's keep ourselves intact for the date.

613
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,200
Professor,

614
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,310
I called because I had something to tell you.

615
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,190
It looks like the rain is going to pour down.

616
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:08,660
And they said that the weather would be nice today.

617
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,230
GRAND OPEN

618
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,740
Right now, there is only

619
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,270
one hour left before the website goes live.

620
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,630
Okay. Let's go.

621
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:28,380
Hey. Call me immediately if anything happens.

622
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,550
Professor. Be careful.

623
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,940
Don't you know that I'm a judo athlete from the national team?

624
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,750
They should be the ones to be careful of me.

625
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,560
Excuse me, Professor.

626
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,890
Forget it.

627
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:48,160
Be ready to give me whatever your answer is when I return.

628
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,700
I'll be back later, kid.

629
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,680
Stay out of it when we make the arrest since only Professor Yu and I are authorized to investigate.

630
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,320
What is there to worry about when there are two veterans here?

631
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,610
Let's get this done quickly.

632
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,790
Error

633
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,630
What's going on?

634
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,660
The data is being erased.

635
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,450
What?

636
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,280
Why?

637
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,360
That's not the right place.

638
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,630
First, let's make sure they can't escape.

639
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,430
I'll go take a look.

640
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,280
I can't get through to Professor Choi.

641
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,140
Professor Gwon isn't picking up either.

642
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,540
Try Professor Yu.

643
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,230
I'll try again.

644
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,030
I'm sure they're safe.

645
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,010
Yes. I'll have to wrap it up before then.

646
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:11,810
Yes. I understand.

647
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:31,010
Hurry up!

648
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,360
How much time to complete?

649
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:44,590
There are only 10 minutes left. We'll leave after we clean up.

650
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,450
Okay, Professor.

651
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,160
Finish up and come.

652
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,510
I'll see you in Thailand.

653
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,360
I'm on my way so get a boat ready.

654
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,050
Okay.

655
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,880
Caught you.

656
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,270
Are you surprised, asshole?

657
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,970
Kang Seon Ho

658
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,960
What's up?

659
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,330
You're in the wrong place, Professor.

660
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:08,950
They didn't go live with the site but instead are running a self-destruct program.

661
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,610
I input the IP address when the firewall went down, but...

662
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,010
Self-destruct program?

663
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:16,490
I think they know we are hacking them.

664
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,790
There's no way it would have leaked.

665
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,960
It could put the others in danger, so I'll leave now, alone.

666
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,210
Hey! Hey ki—

667
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,660
Professor. Please come quickly.

668
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,350
Professor!

669
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:15,340
Professor. Are you all right?

670
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:46,100
This bastard, do you know who you're messing with?

671
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,370
Hurry! Block them!

672
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:28,570
To the back!

673
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:42,930
Go Deok Bae, you are under arrest on charges of opening a gambling operation, violating the Game Industry Promotion Act,

674
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:46,930
violating the Electronic Financial Transactions Act, violating the Crime Proceeds Concealment Control Act,

675
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,730
violating the Telecommunications Business Act,

676
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:51,510
and for violating the Information and Communication Network Act.

677
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:54,890
You have the right to consult an attorney and the right to remain silent.

678
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,980
You have the right to defend yourself,

679
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:01,030
and the right to request the court to review the legality of your arrest without a warrant.

680
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,560
But don't do it, jerk.

681
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,230
Because you're dead meat now.

682
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:18,330
♬ When things don't go your way, tell me.  ♬

683
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:22,590
♬ When it feels like I'm about to fall, hold me ♬

684
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:31,290
♬ When everyone leaves you, tell me. ♬

685
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:35,450
♬ And I'll be by your side, hold me ♬

686
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:50,230
♬ What about it? Can you tell me everything? ♬

687
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:56,850
♬ I'm saying I'll always be by your side. ♬

688
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:01,920
♬ How about it? All of the heavy worries ♬

689
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,220
♬ can you and I ♬

690
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,960
Seon Ho finished his first investigation well.
♬ carry them together? ♬

691
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,620
We're hanging out at the beach!

692
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,190
Have a good time.

693
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:12,100
There aren't any buses going to Seoul.

694
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,050
That crazy asshole!

695
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:13,990
What's that?

696
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:16,720
A gift from my boyfriend. I really love it.

697
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,820
Keep your head up! Just because we don't have money doesn't mean we don't have strength.

698
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,820
What are you talking about?

699
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,510
What do you think I'm talking about? Do a good job!

700
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,430
I'm here to meet with Han Jeong Sik, the head of the criminal investigation department.

701
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:30,480
It'll be your last time taking the students along to do something so dangerous.

702
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,230
How did you know I went with the students?

703
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:36,360
It's finally here.

704
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,770
But how did you get into Police Univerity?

705
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,314
♬ And I'll be by your side, hold me ♬
