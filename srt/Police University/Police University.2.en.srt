00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,390
Episode 2
National Police University

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,670
You want to get into Police University? You can't get in, you punk.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,900
Get out.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,890
Didn't you hear me?

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,350
I said you're out!

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,410
Wait a minute. Well, I don't know what's going on.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,180
But why don't we interview him first—

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,770
If you don't know what's going on, please stay quiet.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,880
Professor Yu, please watch what you say. We're conducting interviews here.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,530
That's what I mean. We don't know what's going on here.

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,340
What on earth did he do that you're like that?

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,230
It's not like he committed a crime.

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,920
Well, is he your enemy or something?

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,900
If there's something you need to tell us, please tell us now.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,680
Or you tell us.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,400
It's something personal.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,770
Is that so? If it's something personal, you shouldn't bring it up here.

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,860
Right? Can we start the interview now?

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,420
Please help him to get in.

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,670
He scored so poorly on his practical test.

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,510
But he did quite well on the written test.

22
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,540
If I get in, I'll do my best to develop my physical strength.

23
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,520
- Really? Then joining the judo club would be good for you.
- Pardon me?

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,480
The judo club. Make sure you join it.

25
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,420
Judo? Not everyone can do judo.

26
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,200
His physicality is a mess. Goodness.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,810
You'll need to take lots of English classes here. It would be good to improve your English score.

28
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,740
He can't even speak Korean properly. Why ask him to study English? Come on.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,120
Professor Yu, why don't you ask him a proper question then?

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,900
Do you think scum-like criminals can be rehabilitated?

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,750
Yes.

32
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,460
I think a healthy society is not a crime-free society but a society where opportunities for renewal are given.

33
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,030
It is unfortunate that the rate of recidivism may rise

34
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,500
due to the strong wall of preconceived notions and prejudices,

35
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,100
after being stamped with scarlet letters of "Criminal Bastard,"

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,550
despite the fact they have committed a crime, reflected on it, and apologized.

37
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,890
On the other hand, I agree that if there is no room for rehabilitation, there should be severe punishment.

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,670
All right. Do you have any last words?

39
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,680
Honestly, it's not my dream to become a police officer.

40
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,760
No, I don't think I've ever had a dream before

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,020
because I have always left my future aspirations blank.

42
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,420
But I saw someone who wrote "National Police University" in that blank space.

43
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,840
I don't know if it started because I was copying that person.

44
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:37,370
But the fact that I filled in that blank,

45
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,380
my father was really happy.

46
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,170
It was my first time to see my father happy like that.

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,580
If this kind of feeling can be called a dream, then I can't give up on this dream now.

48
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,700
I don't have the qualifications yet, and I may still be lacking,

49
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,920
but if you give me a chance on this late dream,

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,180
I will study hard and work hard.

51
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,290
I really want to get accepted.

52
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,530
Interviewer

53
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,650
Let me borrow that.

54
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,300
F

55
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,020
You can't get in, you punk.

56
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,300
All right. Good work.

57
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,840
Thank you.

58
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,820
Wait a moment.

59
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,780
A

60
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,150
He'll pass, that young man.

61
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,800
- Hey there.
- Hey there? (TN: Rude way to address a superior officer.)

62
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,400
Well, what was it? May I ask your name?

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,320
Do you not know who I am?

64
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,360
Right! Didn't we meet at Seocho Police Station?

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,130
No.

66
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,890
- Right. It was there. It's Jongno Police Station.
- That's not it.

67
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,770
Was it North Gyeonggi Province? Or was it Mapo?

68
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,660
Come on. Your face has changed a lot. It was Gwangjin Police Station.

69
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,970
Was it possibly Incheon?

70
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,820
Who are you?

71
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,420
All right. Why don't we take a break?

72
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,460
4 years ago
Is Lieutenant Yu Dong Man here?

73
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,600
Now, the next Exemplary Police Award goes to the Chief Inspector Gwon Hyeok Pil, from the administration department.

74
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,400
It looks like Lieutenant Yu Dong Man is here.

75
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,490
Hey, you punk, get a hold of yourself! Where do you think you're going looking like that?

76
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,650
Hey! Hey! Hey!

77
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,700
Let me borrow that.

78
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,490
Congratulations, Lieutenant Yu.

79
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,770
Enough of this. Let me just say one thing.

80
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:42,180
Because you're doing all this stuff inside, can't you see that the crime scene is going to crap?

81
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,470
If all the support staff here had come,

82
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,590
would the youngest have been stabbed today?

83
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,770
Hey! Come here!

84
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,450
Let go of me!

85
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,060
Exemplary cop, my ass!

86
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,930
A real exemplary cop is not the one who is getting awards

87
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,160
but the one who is running for their life on the streets! Do you even know?!

88
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,760
What are you all doing, not pulling him out of here?!

89
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,890
Get him out of here!
Police Officer Day, Commemoration of Extraordinary Police Officers

90
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,850
F**—

91
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,770
Two police officers with different "class."

92
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,200
Damn it.

93
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,010
That's him, right? The detective from that time? How did we all end up here?

94
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,420
Do you know who Albert Camus is?

95
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,930
- I'm not sure.
- That person said so...

96
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,440
"Not punishing yesterday's crimes

97
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,700
is just as foolish as encouraging tomorrow's crimes."

98
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,790
Yes, it's my stupid mistake to have let you go.

99
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,660
And it must be your fault that we met here in vain.

100
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,920
Do you know Jonas Salk?

101
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,900
"Life is the process of making mistakes and correcting them."

102
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,020
We're done talking, right?

103
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,690
That...

104
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,760
So, did you come here to say goodbye? Like that?

105
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,990
Look at those eyes. You look like you'll butcher me, you b*tch.

106
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,030
If I go to jail this time, I'll be out when you graduate.

107
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,790
- So I have to see my daughter's face before I go.
- Don't swear, it's ignorant.

108
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,590
Yeah, you must be glad you're smart, you b*tch.

109
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,680
I don't know if I'm going through living this difficult life trying not to raise you like me.

110
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,190
What? I'm ignorant?

111
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,880
Stop it before I kill myself!

112
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,800
You're making such a fuss.

113
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,140
Neighbors! My daughter is telling me to my face that she's going to die first!

114
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,470
You b*tch!

115
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,120
You rotten b*tch!

116
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,590
Why don't you stop there? I think I've given you enough slack.

117
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,100
You're a cop, aren't you?

118
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,230
My daughter will be a lieutenant when she graduates from this school. Do you know that?

119
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,410
Hey. Make sure to remember that jerk's face properly.

120
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,080
Understood?

121
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,120
Don't sell this now. Sell it when the price of gold goes up.

122
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,970
Let's go. We have to go, right?

123
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,720
Let's stop doing this, please.

124
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,430
Let's stop meeting each other, please!

125
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,310
Police

126
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,690
Police

127
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,590
You just need three seconds.

128
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,730
If you endure for three seconds, it will be over.

129
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,970
♫ I'm walking in the street ♫

130
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,520
♫ And fell off the first steps ♫

131
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,130
♫ I'm searching for something ♫

132
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,520
Why are you there whenever I cry?

133
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,460
Why are you always there when I'm embarrassed?

134
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,920
♫ We'll take the path where love is ♫

135
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,360
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,520
Go. I don't want to see your face either.

137
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,650
♫ I'll never be the same again ♫

138
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,610
That's right, that's right. He's really an idiot if he leaves just because she asks him to.

139
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,960
My son isn't someone like that. Never.

140
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,420
Aish, that idiot.

141
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,360
Incoming call
Seung Beom

142
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,560
- What?
- I think Seung Beom hasn't had his dinner yet.

143
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,420
Have you ever seen him starving?

144
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,390
- But who was that girl earlier?
- What?

145
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,020
She looks pretty and kind.

146
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,000
Is she someone you have good feelings for?

147
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,700
Is it because of her that you want to go to Police University?

148
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,820
Hey, I'm your father. I know everything by just looking at your eyes.

149
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,640
- It's not like that.
- You can't deny it. I am right.

150
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,590
Oh!

151
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,960
Are you upset?

152
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,950
Crazy jerk. Is that something to get upset about?

153
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,980
You are upset!

154
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,090
Because I ate dinner with father alone.

155
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,990
Hey, can't I do that once?

156
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,540
You idiot, stop talking nonsense.

157
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,560
Why didn't you tell me?

158
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Did you think I'd stop you from going to college?

159
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,780
- Seung Beom.
- The more I think about it the madder I get.

160
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,290
Why did you say you'd go to the military with me then? If you have nothing to say, get out of here.

161
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,260
Hey! If you want to have a conversation, talk instead of getting angry.

162
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,800
Conversation? Have we ever had one before?

163
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,490
You don't talk to me about anything and just tell me what you've already decided!

164
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,630
You damn... You think you're so great and I'm just an immature kid.

165
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,700
Don't follow me. I'm not angry. I'm totally pissed.

166
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,140
- My heart is beating at the thought of a new semester starting.
- Yes.

167
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,180
You will also get to know this feeling while staying in this school, Professor Yu.

168
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,890
Ah. I really don't want to know.

169
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,420
Then, we will begin the orientation for the new semester now, professors.

170
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,700
I am the guidance counselor, Baek Hui.

171
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,910
This year, as usual, we have Professor Seo Sang Hak in charge of public administration.

172
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,520
You will be the professor for the freshmen this year too.

173
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,430
Nice to meet you all.

174
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,540
Our judo professor, Professor Choi Hui Su.

175
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,420
I'm Choi Hui Su.

176
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,580
And for our professor of law, we have Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil.

177
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,490
Thank you.

178
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,080
- Why?
- What are you doing?

179
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,890
Why do you need to know what I'm doing, or are you just slow?

180
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,150
- I'm slow.
- What's the matter with you, punk?

181
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:16,850
And for investigations, our new professor, Professor Yu Dong Man.

182
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,310
Professor Yu Dong Man.

183
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,300
Ah, yes. I am Yu Dong Man.

184
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,800
A call, an urgent call.

185
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,900
Call.

186
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,520
- For policy analysis...
- Are you at school?

187
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,420
Wow. You really adjust fast!

188
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,990
Hey, you haven't been beaten up enough lately, have you?

189
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,290
In two weeks, they're recruiting personnel.

190
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,430
After this, you can't come back even if you want to.

191
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,000
It's here.

192
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,660
Wow, this is really so—

193
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,950
This is a signature draft beer, so it's best to drink it as is—

194
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,200
I want to drink somaek (soju and beer mixed together).

195
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,600
I want some, too.

196
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,800
Then you should have ordered bottled beer.

197
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,230
Why is he like that?

198
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,610
So...

199
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,420
What so?

200
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,740
In order to chase those guys, we're monitoring several different kinds of cryptocurrency.

201
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,190
It will take about three months to catch them.

202
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,300
Not three days or three weeks but three months?

203
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,450
Do you even know how many kinds of cryptocurrency there are?

204
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,040
Also, we aren't even getting paid for the investigation, so I'm dying working all alone!

205
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,700
Can't you see these dark circles going down?

206
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,860
They were there before.

207
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,800
If you just get on your knees and apologize to our team leader—

208
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,340
Are you crazy? Now my pride is on the line.

209
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,060
What pride? It's because you will lose face.

210
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,050
And anyway, I can't trace the account because the exchange was switched.

211
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,390
Now we'll have to ask Yoon.

212
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,020
You have to catch those jerks, don't you?!

213
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,870
- Mentor, is this because of your $100,000?
- What, you punk?

214
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,800
I mean, even if it is because of that, I just don't understand!

215
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,750
You weren't even interested in it, to begin with. And honestly, this was the cyber investigation team's job.

216
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,560
Is it because of that accident in which...

217
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,260
You can't shut your mouth?

218
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,020
Ah, seriously!

219
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,900
I have a very bad feeling about this case.

220
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,320
Who do you think you are that your feelings mean anything?

221
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,780
I was going to tell you when I was sure about it,

222
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,700
but even the fact that the gambling place got cleaned out so quickly

223
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,600
and the way that they slip out of every operation so quickly is so suspicious.

224
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,240
This doesn't seem like a problem we can solve.

225
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,990
I told you to work but you are writing a novel.

226
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,200
Ow! Really? This is the instinct of a detective!

227
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,140
Instinct? Don't even get me started!

228
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,990
What? We can't solve it?

229
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,210
You claim to be a police officer and look at what you're saying.

230
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,880
You have to get another beating. You jerk.

231
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,340
Are you really not going to talk to me?

232
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,460
Will this also end only if I apologize first?

233
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,910
What, you punk?

234
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,500
Never mind. Let's stop this.

235
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,200
Let's go!

236
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,160
This jerk. I told you to stop!

237
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,300
- I said to stop!
- I said let's go, you jerk!

238
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,100
Do I really seem like such an idiot now?

239
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,470
Answer me you jerk. Do I still look like an idiot?!

240
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,950
If you can't hit me you really are an idiot.

241
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,780
Hit me. Hit me you jerk!

242
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,930
What does it matter to you whether I go to college or not?

243
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,880
Isn't it more important to say, "Did you do well in your interview?" or "I hope you get accepted"?

244
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,150
Are you still my friend? Are we still brothers?

245
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,930
You're an idiot that doesn't even want to hear those things from me!

246
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,060
Hit me quickly. Hit me quickly, jerk.

247
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,210
Then, what about you, you jerk? You did judo for ten years

248
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,870
and you could lay me out and knock me out.

249
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,090
You are getting hit, falling down and letting me stomp on you on purpose.

250
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,160
You are more of an idiot!

251
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,450
Stop losing, please.

252
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,180
I'm not going to lose. Even if I die, I won't lose.

253
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,060
Does it hurt?

254
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,340
You're hurt, right? Let me see.

255
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,230
Crazy jerk.

256
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,100
- What about your interview?
- I did well, you punk.

257
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Congratulations, you punk.

258
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,540
That crazy jerk.

259
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,280
Hold on.

260
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,890
A Wish for Acceptance
Haejang Student Dorm

261
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,700
It's here. It's here.

262
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,940
You have passed the freshmen recruitment

263
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,710
examination test for the 2021 school year,

264
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,400
conducted by the National Police University.
- You passed! You passed!

265
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,060
Oh my god!

266
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,210
Hallelujah!

267
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,590
I got admitted! Yay! I got admitted!

268
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,430
Why do you keep looking at it? Can't you see the acceptance?

269
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,770
Father, your second son became a cop. He's a level-six civil servant!

270
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,680
No way, Dad. Are you opening that?

271
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,610
Here.

272
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,470
What's this?

273
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,750
Just spam.

274
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,350
Hold on.

275
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,300
Congratulations on your acceptance to the Marine Corps, Yun Seung Beom.

276
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,200
Here.

277
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,940
Congratulations.

278
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,310
The timing is insane.

279
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,460
You did well.

280
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,610
I want whiskey, too! Why are you drinking the two of you?

281
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,340
Go. And Dad, drop off Seon Ho.

282
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,080
I can go alone, so please see Seung Beom off.

283
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,520
I'm going to leave because I have a business trip.

284
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,390
Both of you take care of yourselves.

285
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,140
Ah, seriously! If you grow old like that, you'll become an old man living alone!

286
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,420
I'll call you, Dad!

287
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,540
Let's go.

288
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,700
Seung Beom!

289
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,010
What? What happened?

290
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,380
Go to college after you're discharged.

291
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,120
I'll be at your college entrance ceremony no matter what, no matter what, so

292
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,040
go to college.

293
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,250
- Hey. Dude.
- Promise me that you'll go to college!

294
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,630
I was going to go, you crazy punk! Did you think you'd be the only college graduate and I'd be just a high school graduate?

295
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,940
And Kang Seon Ho!

296
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,390
Isn't that your train?

297
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,720
What nonsense are you saying?

298
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,630
Hey, hurry!

299
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,180
Car 4 Seat A12.

300
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,250
Okay. Here it is.

301
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,590
Drink it.

302
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,700
Oh. Thanks.

303
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,660
♬ Truly. I wanna know. I wanna know what's on my mind.  ♬

304
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,610
♬ What is this sudden feeling? ♬

305
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:31,730
♬ My heart keeps racing. You're dazzling like a shining star. ♬

306
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,940
♫ When I see you, I'm filled with thoughts of you ♫

307
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,150
You're thirsty, right? I'll go and buy a drink real quick.

308
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,250
- No, it's okay.
- No, I'll be right back.

309
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,080
I said it's fine.

310
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm sorry. Then I'll bring you water whenever you're thirsty during Cheongram training.

311
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,980
Why?

312
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,180
I'm just so happy to have seen you again.

313
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,220
I wanted to see you again no matter what.

314
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,110
♬ With this good feeling, stepping closer to me ♬

315
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,900
♬ Get ready ♬

316
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,120
♬ There's only one thing I wish from you ♬

317
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,250
♬ Just stay by my side ♬

318
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,420
♬ Get ready ♬

319
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,520
What? Say what you wanted to say.

320
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,220
- Huh?
- Say what you wanted to say.

321
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,010
N-No. It's not that.

322
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,130
I'll carry this suitcase for you!

323
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,710
Do what you want.

324
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,110
Okay, good. I'll carry it for you.

325
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,520
One second.

326
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,980
Just give it to me. I'd rather just take it myself.

327
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,880
No, no! I can do it.

328
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,740
I'll just roll it.

329
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,330
Why is it like this?

330
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,310
You're the new Police University enrollees, right?

331
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,110
Huh? Yeah.

332
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,930
Me too. I'll take this to the meeting place.

333
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,970
It's okay though.

334
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,380
I can take it.

335
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,040
Police University

336
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,440
Nice to meet you.

337
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,250
I am Baek Hui, the guidance counselor of the National Police University.

338
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,430
For the next two weeks, you'll partake in our Cheongram training. The 'Cheong' means green, and 'ram' means cradle.

339
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,690
It means that we will nurture talented people here.

340
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,480
But unlike its beautiful name,

341
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,370
you will go through intense and rigorous times, that will make you think of your mother's face at every moment.

342
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,730
Endure it. Overcome it.

343
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,080
You will be the leading force of the next generation of police.

344
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,620
I hope all of you complete the training successfully,

345
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,360
without anyone getting hurt or giving up.

346
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,800
Applause.

347
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,390
How do I get it back?

348
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,440
I'm going crazy, seriously.

349
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,120
Yes, yes.

350
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,590
That punk!

351
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,040
You're coming in here?

352
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,530
Do my words seem like a joke to you?

353
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,290
Honestly, I don't know why you are being like this!

354
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,950
You're the one who told me to use the rest of my life to pay back my father for getting on his knees.

355
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,450
Yes, I said that. But you said this, too.

356
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,440
"Life is the process of making mistakes and correcting them."

357
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm here trying to correct my mistake. My mistake for letting you off.

358
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,550
You can't come to this school, you punk.

359
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,540
This will be the last time you're standing here. Do you understand?

360
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,260
I was officially accepted into this school.

361
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,550
We'll see about that.

362
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,200
Wow! This is so nice.

363
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,590
This is the best.

364
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,160
Wow. This National Police University is something...

365
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,900
Hey, bro!

366
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,450
I knew you'd get in.

367
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,020
Exactly! It's so nice to see you again!

368
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,460
I'm No Beom Tae.

369
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,580
How could you think of coming to this school?

370
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:57,270
But how do you know Professor Yu Dong Man?

371
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,550
- Just from here and there.
- How nice.

372
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,180
They say connections and relationships are everything in Korea.

373
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,140
- We're more like an ill-fated relationship.
- What?

374
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,030
Once we get this training, it's the end, right?

375
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,530
The end? Now is just the beginning, bro!

376
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,420
Let's get through Cheongram training and

377
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,990
make it to the final step of admission, okay?!

378
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,980
Agreed!

379
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,330
You can flunk out here too?

380
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,460
Of course! You don't know anything, do you?

381
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,110
There are many people who drop out because they can't last through Cheongram training.

382
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,870
If you get on the bad side of a drill instructor, you won't even last two days.

383
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,520
Who's going to be our drill instructor?

384
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,320
Please give me an easy teacher. Please.

385
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,390
It's nice to meet you. I'm Chief Inspector Yu Dong Man, and

386
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,030
I'm guiding your Cheongram training.

387
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,690
I'm warning you, don't stand out and don't mess around.

388
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,560
Train quietly, as if you're not there.

389
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,980
Whoever catches my eye will, without fail, be dropped.

390
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,040
Without fail.

391
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,830
The Cheongram training begins now.

392
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,140
- Fifty-one!

393
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,890
- Fifty-two!

394
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,440
- Fifty-three!
- Do it properly!

395
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,090
- Fifty-four!
- Put your arms up properly!

396
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,900
Watch your elbows!

397
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,320
- Fifty-six
- I said do it right!

398
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,530
Yes sir!

399
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,950
How long—

400
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,230
How long are we going to jump for?

401
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,740
Don't tell me it's over when someone dies.

402
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,670
Who's jumping while running his mouth right now?

403
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,620
Raise your arms!

404
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,100
- Line up.
- Stop!

405
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,390
Kang Seon Ho, you're the base line.

406
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,990
- Baseline!
- Gather around him!

407
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,140
You cadets will be divided into three squads, and in the future,

408
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,320
you will move, gather, and train together.

409
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,380
For each squad, select a squad leader.

410
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,790
Remember, if the members can't keep up with the training,

411
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,850
all responsibility will be taken by the squad leader.

412
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,360
Nevertheless, are there any

413
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,110
brave applicants, who want to be a squad leader?

414
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,710
All of you said they will become police officers to protect the citizens.

415
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,540
Are all of you cowards?

416
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,740
Park Min Gyu, a cadet at the National Police University.

417
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,990
I'll do my best!

418
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,530
Okay. What about the 2nd squad?

419
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,700
Oh Kang Hui, a cadet at the National Police University. I'd like to apply.

420
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,100
All right.

421
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,840
Okay, everyone. Then the for the last, 3rd squad.

422
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,430
You there!

423
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,780
Yes?

424
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,530
- Me?
- Yes.

425
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:47,570
You look like you need courage, you're the 3rd squad leader.

426
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,330
Let's see if you can hold out, you son of a b*tch.

427
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,700
You really want to do this, you shameless man?

428
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,170
What's wrong with that punk's eyes?

429
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,560
Aren't you going to lower your eyes, you punk?

430
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,230
He's really trying to die.

431
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,150
Hey! Lower your eyes!

432
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,010
I knew it. Having connections mattered.

433
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,160
I need to work harder! Get your act together, No Beom Tae!

434
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,020
Did you get in touch with that hacker, Yoon?

435
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,290
Are you sure you're close with him?

436
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,850
I'm busy, you punk! I have a punk here, I need to weed out right now.

437
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,670
- Who is it?
- Kang Seon Ho.

438
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,230
What? Kang Seon Ho, the one who got you demoted?

439
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,140
I'm hanging up!

440
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,780
That dumb son of a bitch. Seriously.

441
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,830
[Cheol Jin] It's because I really don't have a good feeling about this.

442
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,900
Why don't you just talk to team leader Kang and work it out together?

443
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:10,000
Why does he keep talking about his feelings?

444
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,860
Feeling? What bullshit.

445
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,140
Yoon, that punk, where the hell did this guy go?

446
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,660
Yoon, track an IP address for me.

447
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,440
Did you send Yu Dong Man, the one who was after us, here?

448
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,170
Are we all going to die now?

449
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,170
Charge forward!

450
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,390
Left foot!

451
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,180
Left foot! Get it together!

452
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,170
Left foot! Left foot!

453
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,280
Left foot! Left foot!

454
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,300
Left foot! Left foot!

455
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,840
Left foot! Left foot! Hey! Why aren't you focusing?!

456
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,940
- What's wrong with him?
- Left foot! Left foot! Left foot!

457
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,000
Left foot!!

458
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,690
This is driving me nuts.

459
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,330
Tell 1st and 2nd squad to sit on their knees.

460
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,310
1st and 2nd squads, stop.

461
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,620
Squat on one knee.

462
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,850
Over there, 3rd squad, which has no concept of lining up in a row to march,

463
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,510
shout aloud for three seconds.

464
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,940
While the commands are dragged out, take the time to get ready.

465
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,410
How many times do I have to tell you to move quickly?

466
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,090
Hey! The 3rd squad go again!

467
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,460
Face left and go!

468
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,500
One, two!

469
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,690
One, two!

470
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,770
That's a total mess. Tell them to stop.

471
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,690
Stop.

472
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,740
The squad's failure is the squad leader's incompetence.

473
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,520
3rd squad leader.

474
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,280
Get down in a plank.

475
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,700
When I say, "one," you go down. When I say, "two," you come up.

476
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,420
One.

477
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,080
Two.

478
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,680
One.

479
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,070
One.

480
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,090
One.

481
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,480
One.

482
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,000
If the leader's stomach hits the ground,

483
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,980
the entire squad will do the drill.

484
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,400
See...

485
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,360
I told you you're not a police officer.

486
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,900
3rd squad, all of you get down.

487
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,310
Get down!

488
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,460
Get down.

489
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,250
- Get down.
- Get down.

490
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,320
When I say, "one," you go down. When I say, "two," you come up.

491
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,500
- One.
- One.

492
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,030
- Two.
- Two.

493
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,260
One.

494
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,190
It's really strange.

495
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,220
Why is he volunteering to be a training professor,

496
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,880
when he's so mad about coming here like a dog being dragged to a slaughterhouse to die?

497
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,420
Are you really curious about reason or are you curious about the person?

498
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,550
Both of them.

499
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,130
♫ We know ♫

500
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,550
♫ this path that the heart chose is too far and too rough ♫

501
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,180
♫ We don't know how to take a step back ♫

502
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,000
♫ We have never learned nor do we want to know.  ♫

503
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,490
3rd squad, you're out.

504
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,340
♫ We're taking a deep breath with a tough look ♫

505
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,080
♫ Let's run, ready, go, farther than anyone else ♫

506
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,330
♫ We'll do it faster. Faster than fast ♫

507
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,980
Again! Again!

508
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,860
Why are we watching this?

509
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,050
You're leaving?

510
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,190
3rd squad, you're out!

511
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,890
♫ In my heart ♫

512
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,860
Turn her over!

513
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,070
I'm sorry. I can't go easy on you.

514
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,530
I have to feed the kids.

515
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,760
I'll do my best, too.

516
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,980
♫ Let's run, ready, go, farther than anyone else ♫

517
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,140
♫ We'll do it faster. Faster than fast ♫

518
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,980
♫ Fly away towards tomorrow ♫

519
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,900
Everyone in the 3rd squad seems incompetent, including the leader.

520
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,760
♫ The hot sun is not in the sky ♫

521
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,880
♫ I found it, in my heart (in my heart) ♫

522
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,100
I wanted to be in Min Gyu's squad, too.

523
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,030
I should have been the leader.

524
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,020
Damn really...

525
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,180
We can't fail.

526
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,390
The side dish for today is sausages.

527
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,840
It's sausages.

528
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,180
How could it be sausages?

529
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,270
Honestly, shouldn't Kang Seon Ho voluntarily drop out?

530
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,500
How could he lose to a woman?

531
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,420
What kind of guy like that wants to be the leader and be a police officer?

532
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,850
I...

533
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,250
Research and Lecture Building

534
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,400
- Is the hillside training next?
- Oh!

535
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,870
Hey, that's good.

536
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,410
Then I won't roll or fall over, or anything like that.

537
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,220
You don't know that.

538
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,590
You could go down the hill by rolling down.

539
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,490
What?

540
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,970
You there! With the incorrect uniform!

541
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,910
Does a cadet wear slippers?

542
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,050
I'm sorry. I'll change to running shoes right away.

543
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,320
Does only your foot hurt now?

544
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,200
Did you think about all the other cadets that are all blistered from training?

545
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,210
Sunbaenim. Hello

546
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,660
I'm Oh Kang Hui, the leader of the 2nd cadet unit.

547
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,150
I'm sorry, Sunbaenim. I spilled water on her shoes.

548
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:29,420
It's my fault her uniform is incorrect. I'm sorry.

549
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,030
This is a warning to the 2nd cadet unit.

550
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,820
Are you okay?

551
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,710
Hey! Their leader is really awesome.

552
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,330
She is really awesome.

553
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,370
Did you strain it a lot?

554
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,060
Left foot! Left foot!

555
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,090
Left foot! Left foot!

556
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,640
One. Two. Three.

557
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,110
Four. One.

558
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,030
Two.

559
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,950
Three.

560
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,740
March in place. March in place!

561
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,400
Stop marching in place.

562
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,700
One. Two.

563
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,750
This is the Cheongram Hill.

564
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,300
It's the 'panting' hill that National Police University is proud of. (T/N: a hill that will leave you out of breath.)

565
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:17,200
If you can't get over this hill, do you think you can catch a killer on the scene?

566
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,810
Everyone will do the duck walk.

567
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,170
The duck walk?

568
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,610
The time limit is 15 minutes. For the cadet unit that doesn't make it on time,

569
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,640
you should be prepared to leave tonight.

570
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,610
'Panting' Hill
1 min 20 seconds

571
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,620
Don't take it easy!

572
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,900
We have to keep going. Can't give up.

573
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,770
Beom Tae, are you okay?

574
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,130
I'm all right, sir.

575
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,190
- Do you want to go home?
- No, we can do it.

576
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,430
No, we don't.

577
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,450
Then hurry up and go!

578
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,500
Let's hurry up and go!

579
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,910
Stay in position.

580
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:26,550
Keep your hands clasped.

581
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,360
You don't have much time left!

582
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,000
Refreshing ice water is waiting for you.

583
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,200
- Go all the way!
- Go all the way in!

584
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,360
You're almost there. You're almost there.

585
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,310
You're almost there.

586
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,430
Just a little further.

587
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,930
All of the first squad's members have made it through.

588
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,360
Go all the way.

589
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:04,070
There isn't much time left.

590
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,970
Ah, the 3rd cadet unit...

591
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,040
Beom Tae!

592
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,910
- I will push you.
- No, no.

593
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,130
Just leave and go.

594
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,060
Hey, the time's almost over.

595
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,210
I'm screwed.

596
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,940
Let's live together and die together.

597
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,250
Here, get up.

598
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,400
- Unit Leader.
- We can do it.

599
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,190
Let's go.

600
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,620
Fighting! Fighting! (T/N: Let's go, you can do this!)

601
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,790
- Beom Tae just a little more...
- Beom Tae.

602
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:56,700
Beom Tae.

603
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,200
- You're almost there.
- Fighting!

604
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,460
You're almost there.

605
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,110
You can do make it!

606
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,810
Fighting!

607
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:03,990
- Fighting!
- Be strong just a little more!

608
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,600
Be strong!

609
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,820
- Fighting!
- You're almost there!

610
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,060
Just a little more!

611
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,500
Please.

612
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,130
Fighting!

613
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,210
Fighting!

614
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,230
Fighting! You're almost there!

615
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,450
All but the 3rd cadet squad, go to the cafeteria.

616
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:00,420
The 3rd cadet squad will duck walk up this hill again.

617
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,960
- Get up.
- Get up.

618
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,370
Move quickly.

619
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,660
But Professor

620
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,510
the leader ... because of me...

621
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:16,280
He can't even take care of himself. Who is he to take care of someone else.

622
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,610
What did I do so wrong?

623
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,850
I'm asking because I really don't know.

624
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,530
Being incompetent is your fault.

625
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,950
It's wrong to hang on when you don't deserve it.

626
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,490
It's wrong to act up when you don't even know your place, you punk.

627
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:36,800
You have nothing to say, right? Then go back down, you punk.

628
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,370
Squad Leader!

629
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,960
No one's watching. Let's just head in.

630
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,170
Leader.

631
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,340
Are you okay?

632
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,230
I'm okay. I'm okay.

633
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,700
Hey, hey, sit down.

634
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,770
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

635
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,460
Hey, I'll go get some pain-relief patches for now.

636
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,480
- I will go get ice.
- Stay here and rest.

637
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,410
- Just stay here for a moment.
- Thank you.

638
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,420
Drink it. You look like you're hot.

639
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,740
I was supposed to take care of you.

640
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,820
It's fine.

641
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,810
You are good. I don't think I have what it takes to be the leader.

642
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,880
What it takes?

643
00:47:54,860 --> 00:48:00,570
Leader. I never asked for your help.

644
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,900
What?

645
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:08,360
If you do that, you take the opportunity away for me to solve the problem.

646
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,110
What kind of thing is that?

647
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:23,390
You, me, and Park Min Gyu. It's all the same for everyone.

648
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:31,150
I really don't know

649
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,560
what to do.

650
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,670
Why don't you just be yourself?

651
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:50,280
It's not that everyone is good or bad, but they're working hard.

652
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,560
You just ignore other people's eyes and thoughts.

653
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,860
Do it your way.

654
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,280
- My way?
- Yes.

655
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,680
Covering for me and pushing Beom Tae today.

656
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,770
That's who you are.

657
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,260
Hey, Squad Leader.

658
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,830
How did you think to hide this?

659
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:37,000
When I took the third exam, I did a lot of research,

660
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,850
and I heard that being hungry is the hardest thing in Cheongram training.

661
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:46,230
And I'm really sorry and grateful to Seon Ho.

662
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,560
I get it, but no matter what I think, I don't think this is right.

663
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,550
If we get caught like this, we could really get kicked out of school.

664
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:01,130
Okay. If that's what you think.

665
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,520
Are you giving up on ramen right now, comrades?

666
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,810
This smell.

667
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,430
These noodles.

668
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,620
No. What the squad leader said is right.

669
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:24,570
Seon Ho, I think you are the most like a police officer out of all the friends

670
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:29,110
I've met since entering National Police University.

671
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,230
You'll be a great cop,

672
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:37,720
protecting our men and leading them on the right path.

673
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,570
I thought I wasn't qualified.

674
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,850
Hey man, what are you talking about?

675
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:53,210
I felt it when I saw you, bro.

676
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,410
If I had been the squad leader, I would have been in big trouble.

677
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,080
I would have already passed away,

678
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,800
died already, or killed myself.

679
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,940
Let's not eat anything like this, like the squad leader said.

680
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,850
If you throw away food, you'll get punished.

681
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,790
Just 30 seconds, that's it. Okay?

682
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,220
Who are you?

683
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,940
Who are you?!

684
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,710
What's going on?

685
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,420
Oh no!

686
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,950
Kang Seon Ho?

687
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,730
What are you doing here?

688
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,840
What's that behind you?

689
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,540
What is it?

690
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,250
Are you blocking me?

691
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,020
You're eating ramen?

692
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,850
Come follow me.

693
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,880
Come out!

694
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,590
Whoever passes through this place, your country believes in you.

695
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,860
Let's meet up.

696
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,290
It's because I have something to talk to you about.

697
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,880
Why won't you hurry up and tell me?! Who were you with?

698
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,550
Are you stepping up to take the lead or something like that?

699
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:02,670
Okay. Let's see when you will come down from there.

700
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,350
Do 30 more laps around the field.

701
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,530
Let's just go and tell the truth, huh?

702
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,220
Seon Ho will die if he does that.

703
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,630
All right, we should at least get punished together.

704
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,190
Don't move.

705
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,050
How about you just be yourself?

706
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:56,420
Covering for me and pushing Beom Tae today.

707
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,850
That's who you are.

708
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:01,160
Look at him.

709
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,950
Keep going around the field until it burns.

710
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,210
I was alone!

711
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,630
Do you think I'm stupid?

712
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,090
Should we take a look at the CCTV?

713
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,360
Whether it's a hundred

714
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,970
or two hundred laps, I'll accept all the punishment.

715
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:33,580
I should have stopped him as the squad leader, but I couldn't even control this,

716
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,530
and it was my mistake to eat the ramen with them.

717
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:40,880
The leader of his squad has done something shameful.

718
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,500
I don't want my classmates to see me like this anymore.

719
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,380
Please let me be the only one who gets the punishment.

720
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,710
This punk is all talk.

721
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,820
Hey Han Min Guk, go in and do a roll call on the kids.

722
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,760
Okay.

723
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,590
Are you still not going to leave on your own?

724
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:08,810
Aren't you going to answer me, punk?

725
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,610
Why?

726
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,140
Why can't I be here?

727
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:22,680
Do you think this is unreasonable for just eating ramen with your classmates?

728
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,760
Is it unfair?

729
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:28,190
Don't be ridiculous.

730
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,090
It's easy for you, breaking rules like this.

731
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:33,950
Doing something you shouldn't have done.

732
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,720
I don't think that's right.

733
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,480
No? What's not right?

734
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,420
Can't you just give a break to a kid, who made one mistake?

735
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:46,620
You didn't do it once.

736
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:52,010
You didn't do it once, you punk!

737
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:57,510
Dad's not going to have cancer anymore!

738
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:01,330
Bank of Royal transfer to Kang Seon Ho

739
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:04,200
Deposit Complete: ₩5,000,000

740
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,590
Go to college!

741
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,790
08-18-2020 New deposit - ₩5,000,000

742
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:16,720
This crazy punk, where did he get this kind of money?

743
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,010
Seven-million won transfer at 7:15 pm.

744
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,710
Transferring another five million won at 7:18 pm.

745
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,920
It's hard to commit a crime the first time. The second time is easy.

746
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,780
You don't even feel bad the third time.

747
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:40,630
And you want to be a cop?

748
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,290
Do you get it now? The reason why you can't be one.

749
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:49,270
The reason you're not qualified to be at the National Police University.

750
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,620
What? It's a late dream of yours?

751
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,000
You're all talk, punk.

752
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,750
Are you not going to give me an excuse?

753
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:06,220
I have nothing to say. I'm sorry.

754
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,450
Oh, all right. If you did, I was going to rip that mouth off.

755
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,710
It's wrong to hold on when you don't deserve it.

756
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:20,030
I told you it's wrong to act up when you don't even know your place, right?

757
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,870
Just leave on your own.

758
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,100
- I'm sorry.
- I said to leave, you punk!

759
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,590
I was wrong. Please give me one more chance.

760
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:39,300
I won't break the rules again. I'll abide by the rules.

761
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,900
I'll change to be a good fit for National Police University.

762
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:49,500
Please give me one last chance.

763
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:56,670
A chance is for someone who deserves it.

764
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:59,330
You don't deserve it.

765
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,060
Professor, the leader said we really can't eat it,

766
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:17,650
but we said we'd eat it. It's not Seon Ho's fault.

767
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:21,750
If Seon Ho just said our names, he wouldn't get punished like that.

768
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Professor, don't scold him for protecting us.

769
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,270
What do you want, punk?

770
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:39,340
Don't be surprised and listen. It's about your online friend,

771
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,130
that hacker Yoon.

772
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:43,940
Yes, did you find him?

773
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,900
It's Kang Seon Ho.

774
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,940
What the hell are you saying?

775
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,480
You know, that Kang Seon Ho we caught not that long ago.

776
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,650
That guy was your online friend, Yoon.

777
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:01,320
Wow, an online comrade is an enemy offline.

778
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,000
You're in a little bit of trouble, aren't you?

779
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,780
How can that punk be...

780
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:40,300
If chances are given to those who deserve it,

781
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,730
then I will try to win first place for the 3rd cadet squad in the last training session.

782
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,090
If I can't make it then as well,

783
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:51,400
then I'll leave on my own, without saying anything.

784
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:57,490
So could you decide after the training is finished

785
00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:02,560
whether or not I'm allowed to stay at this school?

786
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:16,490
♫ Fly away towards tomorrow now, ♫

787
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:20,170
♫ fly away high to the end. ♫

788
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:23,430
♫ The hot sun is not in the sky. ♫

789
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,180
♫ I found it (I found it) ♫

790
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,120
♫ in my heart (in my heart) ♫

791
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,100
♫ Challenging ourselves every day, we're gonna burn it up. ♫

792
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:35,380
♫ There's nothing we can't get through together. ♫

793
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,150
♫ We're not stopping. Never stop. ♫

794
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,660

Police University

796
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,970
A miracle? A surprise that you are dreaming of?

797
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,970
Can't I dream of it? You don't have to say that I will fail in such a long way.

798
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,610
Hyung! Hyung! I got into the National Police University.

799
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:52,030
Ah, this punk, how could he keep calling me hyung?

800
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,780
What are you going to do about Kang Seon Ho?

801
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,000
Do what your heart tells you to do? Who is this woman?

802
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,250
- Who is it?
- Huh?

803
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,110
Who is the person you like?

804
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:00,940
If I officially pass, I'll tell you.

805
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,000
Then I guess I have to start rooting for you, too.

806
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,210
I can't leave this school.

807
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,370
I will definitely pass.

808
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,490
Sunbae, you're not going to give up, right?

809
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:09,190
Cheol Jin. Park— Hey Cheol Jin!

810
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:13,360
- What about school?
- I will voluntarily leave.
