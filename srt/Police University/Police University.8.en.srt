1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,740
Episode 8
We're coming!

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,370
- Sorry.
- This way!

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,090
Stay still!

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,350
4 years ago

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,300
He's in Incheon, isn't he? I'll come with you.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,100
Go away. You're annoying.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,380
What are you going to do alone?

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,330
Do you not know that you have to go to the award function tomorrow?

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,760
Also, I've been on Detective Team 1 for one year, and I'm your partner!

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,520
Ridiculous! How dare you call yourself a partner?

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,460
Go away.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,530
I'll show you that even I can be a worthy partner.

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,020
Gosh. Seriously?

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,240
Hey! Hey, stop!

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,790
That's why I told you not to follow me here!

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,990
Back up!

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,010
Where did they go?

18
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,450
No!

19
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,550
Cheol Jin!

20
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,740
That crazy jerk!

21
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,980
Let go. You crazy jerk!

22
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,750
Cheol Jin!

23
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,680
Let go, you crazy jerk!

24
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,410
I won't let go even if I die.

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,040
Mentor!

26
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,940
Hurry, hurry!

27
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,180
This way!

28
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,350
I'm sorry I left you and ran when I'm supposed to be your partner.

29
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,390
What? Why are saying things like that?

30
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,390
Now that I have a knife wound, I kind of look cool,

31
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,200
but I was scared out of my mind.

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,260
How will I ever go investigating in the middle of the night by myself?

33
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,960
Who said I would let you go alone?

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,990
Hereafter, I will always be behind you, so don't be afraid.

35
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,070
Ah, jeez.

36
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,780
Ah, jeez.

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,100
Mentor!

38
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,830
The fingerprints on this laptop

39
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,550
don't match the remote that you brought me,

40
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,350
but they match this plastic cup.

41
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,630
Professor!

42
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,770
Professor's Office

43
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,860
I can't drop out of this investigation.

44
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,820
No. I won't drop out.

45
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,710
I heard that there is a criminal at the National Police University.

46
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,700
Hey. How did you...

47
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,280
I really need to catch that criminal.

48
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,700
So, all those who are precious to me,

49
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,070
I must protect them.

50
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,790
I've made my decision. Now it's time for you to make your decision, Professor.

51
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,060
I have to see this investigation through to the end.

52
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,830
Mentor.

53
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,690
I think he came back, but...

54
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,250
What about Seon Ho? Did he go to the library?

55
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,700
It's the start of finals, so all the kids are swarming there.

56
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,660
Who are you? Do you know me?

57
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,730
- Ah. I came to meet my friend Seon Ho!
- Get out.

58
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,840
- I'm leaving!
- Get out!

59
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,890
Seon Ho!

60
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,830
- Hi!
- Wait.

61
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,770
- This seat is taken.
- Oh, okay.

62
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,100
Sorry, sorry.

63
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,070
Where did he go to make his case?

64
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,700
Why are you drinking so much? It's like you've decided to get drunk.

65
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,610
You start talking first.

66
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,120
Huh?

67
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,200
Explain to me the reasons why you think this punk is the culprit—speculative reasoning and basis.

68
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,550
Wh-What? Who is the culprit? Me?

69
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,500
I've finished analyzing Mr. Park Cheol Jin's cell phone communication data.

70
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,470
What?

71
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,700
The unregistered cellphone signal that was captured at the base station,

72
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,820
whenever it contacted your phone,

73
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,100
your phone signal was captured at that same base station after a few hours, several times.

74
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,130
Nonsense.

75
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,230
So?

76
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,010
It means the unregistered phone called him, and Cheol Jin came here.

77
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,090
Phone, movement, the same base station.

78
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,130
The same pattern kept reappearing.

79
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,390
What is this jerk saying?

80
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,570
Hey! I really...

81
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,540
Are the cause and effect certain?

82
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,750
Is that the only one?

83
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,690
Wasn't there any time that I called him and Cheol Jin came to the Police University?

84
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,390
Your theory lacks evidence.

85
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,620
The fact that the evidence is lacking doesn't mean that it isn't true.

86
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,840
Why did you come to Police University when the professor didn't call you?

87
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,590
This jerk keeps saying nonsense.

88
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,100
Mentor, it's not me. Why would I do such things?

89
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,490
Shut up and follow me.

90
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,900
Wow. I really...

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,760
Mentor, you really aren't believing what that jerk is saying, right?

92
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,330
Mentor. Say something!

93
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,790
Why did you touch Kang Seon Ho's laptop?

94
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,140
Mentor.

95
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,420
The laptop that was on the table. I just wondered what it was so I touched it.

96
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,010
Then why did you investigate my communication pattern?

97
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,140
What exactly were you suspecting me of?

98
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,290
Whether it happened while you were investigating and fell into a trap, or

99
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,900
whether you're really on the same side as those punks.

100
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,720
I don't know if you're pretending to have lost your memories, right?

101
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,350
Mentor.

102
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,680
We don't know if you touched the laptop

103
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,230
with the hope of finding something in there.

104
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,800
Do you really think that?

105
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,860
For the past six years, while getting stabbed together,

106
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,380
I gave my all to the job!

107
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,940
That's why I know it well.

108
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,560
What expression you make when you're lying.

109
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,850
Just go, Cheol Jin.

110
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,750
Could you make a U-turn, please?

111
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,510
Shall I make the U-turn or not?

112
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,700
Mr. Park Cheol Jin.

113
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,300
I think you took my taxi the previous time too.

114
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,860
I can't do it anymore.

115
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,220
No, I don't want to do it anymore.

116
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,210
It's very hard.

117
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,020
Seriously.

118
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,910
Driver, could you please stop the car?

119
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,330
So you do remember everything.

120
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,340
They will call.

121
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,130
Police University

122
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,690
Has just about everyone submitted their exam papers?

123
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,160
Yes, except for Professor Yu.

124
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,650
Professor Yu, even if it gets late, you should upload it to the cloud by tomorrow night.

125
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,800
- Professor Yu.
- Yes?

126
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,040
Exam paper.

127
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,100
Ah, ah. Yes, I got it.

128
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,390
Yes. Okay, so shall we wrap up the meeting?

129
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,710
Good job all of you.

130
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,650
Submit your exam paper tomorrow and go on a drive with me, okay?

131
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,150
To where?

132
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,970
Misari or Yangsuri. There are plenty of places that end with "ri."

133
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,070
Why do you want to go to that kind of place? It's dark and narrow, and there are a lot of accidents there.

134
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,580
That's why we should go. It's dark and narrow, so some accidents could happen.

135
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,340
What was that? I was rejected right now, wasn't I?

136
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,220
Ah, seriously. So this is the so-called "killing" exam period.

137
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,350
I flunked my mid-terms, so if I mess up my finals too, I'll die.

138
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,260
- Hmmm, you die.
- Hmmm, no I won't.

139
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,550
Kang Seon Ho- Are you studying well? Shall we have some coffee?

140
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,450
Here.

141
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,180
So, did you talk well with Professor Yu Dong Man?

142
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,250
Not yet. Seems like he needs some time.

143
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,340
But, he will be alright soon.

144
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,700
The professor I know is always like that.

145
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,770
You said you were only investigating together. It seems like you've gotten quite close with him.

146
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,580
We only fight every day.

147
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,450
That is close. If you weren't close, you wouldn't fight. You would just ignore each other.

148
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,590
So, when will you tell me about the investigation that you are doing with Professor?

149
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,330
I haven't been able to come to a good resolution.

150
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,770
- Sorry.
- You don't have to be sorry.

151
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,320
Also, when I'm done with the professor, you're next.

152
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,500
Let's come to a resolution regarding our relationship now.

153
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,880
Hey, I didn't ask because I want some quick resolution with you.

154
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,570
I only asked because it may be related to my mom.

155
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,090
Why are you laughing at this time?

156
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,450
I don't think I should be wasting time. Let's go. I'll finish it off.

157
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,550
What shouldn't you be wasting time on? Hey, Kang Seon Ho!

158
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,680
Cyber Forensics Final Exam

159
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,390
Are you okay, sir?

160
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,430
Since when did you know about this?

161
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,030
Since when did you know that the culprit is in Police University?

162
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,860
After the sports festival.

163
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,970
I heard you talking to Ahjussi Cheol Jin.

164
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,600
This jerk! Why did you eavesdrop on your elders' conversation?

165
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,850
Why did you not tell me?

166
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,110
I wasn't even sure about it.

167
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,790
It could just uselessly affect our investigation.

168
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,490
Still, if the wiretap was discovered, isn't it certain?

169
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,880
There is nothing that is certain. We haven't even done the investigation properly.

170
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,400
The ones we were actually chasing were the people behind the illegal gambling website.

171
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,330
Whether they are inside or outside the Police University,

172
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,400
it is a fact that they are near us.

173
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,170
If Cheol Jin is really the culprit,

174
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,350
shouldn't we investigate how deeply he is involved

175
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,420
and how many b*stards are behind him?

176
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,400
So, that means we will do it properly now, right?

177
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,920
No matter what happens, we will go till the end, right?

178
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,490
Ah, what did you hear till now?

179
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,800
Of course, we have to go till the end!

180
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,720
What exactly do you want to hear from me?

181
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,230
We can't avoid it even if we want to, and we can't change anything by doing nothing.

182
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,600
We can face whatever it is only if we proceed.

183
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,410
For now, we have to proceed to find out what is at the end of our investigation.

184
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,760
I'll block him in such a way that he can't do anything.

185
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,530
No matter what I do, I'll block him in such a way that he can't proceed.

186
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,240
I'll do it properly this time, so

187
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,330
give me just one more chance.

188
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,250
Professor's Office

189
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,240
Professor Yu Dong Man

190
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,730
Why did I want to become a police officer?

191
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:36,800
Exactly. Anyway, we can't become police officers if we don't pass the exams and graduate.

192
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,930
If you have time to worry about that, use that time to study.

193
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,480
It's because we aren't able to study.

194
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,740
- Do you know the answer to this question?
- What is it?

195
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,280
What is it? What is it? What is it?

196
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,330
- Oh!
- Why? Why? Why?

197
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,680
He graduated getting straight "A's" in all of his classes during all four years.

198
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,920
The Sunbae, who is at the headquarters and is being called the next commissioner.

199
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,270
I know I know. Of course, I know.

200
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,920
These are the legendary questions he apparently wrote out to study.

201
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,260
- How much?
- Give me your price first, Customer.

202
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,990
No negotiations, right?

203
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,610
Guys, this is Police University.

204
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,290
- Anything that raises speculative—
- Chicken.

205
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,670
Whoa, chicken.

206
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,460
- Plus pizza.
- Pizza.

207
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,000
- Plus beer!
- Beer!

208
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,660
I'll pass on this.

209
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,800
- Are you serious?
- I'm going ahead.

210
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,900
- I'll set you up on a blind date.
- Blind date?

211
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,260
- I'll give you the expenses for the blind date too.
- The expenses for the blind date too.

212
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,050
♫ I'm walking in the street ♫

213
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,580
♫ I follow the first steps ♫

214
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,190
♫ I'm searching for something ♫

215
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,850
♫ That we all dreamed of ♫

216
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,570
Look at your book and stop looking at me.

217
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,520
Oh, okay.

218
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,140
Ah, did you talk well with Professor?

219
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,090
Ah. I did try.

220
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,260
Sorry.

221
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,230
It's only till the exam period ends.

222
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,340
If it's all over, you should tell me everything.

223
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,440
I will.

224
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,560
- Back to our studies.
- Okay.

225
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,970
Okay.

226
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,540
Hey, Min Gyu. Did you see this?

227
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,680
Look at it and then give it to me.

228
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,540
It seemed like patient Park Cheol Jin got his memories back.

229
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,580
Didn't you know?

230
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,630
Cheol Jin

231
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,890
Cheol Jin
Call Log

232
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,380
Incoming call- Professor Baek

233
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,080
Hello.

234
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,250
Professor Yu Dong Man.

235
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,360
A student made a tip

236
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,020
that what's making the rounds amongst the students

237
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,220
seems like the cyber forensics final exam paper.

238
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Professor Yu Dong Man, is it the one?

239
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,380
Is it the final exam paper?

240
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,230
Yes it is.

241
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,180
Why is this here?

242
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,150
The cyber forensics exam hasn't been uploaded to the cloud yet.

243
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,370
Did you perhaps print the exam paper?

244
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,880
Yes, I did print a copy to check it one last time last night.

245
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,320
Did anyone come to your office after the exam paper was ready?

246
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,010
Let's check the hallway CCTV by the office.

247
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,400
Yes, sir.

248
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,840
Professor Yu Dong Man, let me have a word with you.

249
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,870
The cyber forensics document you were looking at this morning?

250
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,630
Yes. They said that's the cyber forensics exam paper for this term.

251
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,880
I think it was leaked.

252
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,250
What about Professor Yu Dong Man?

253
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,020
The report was filed at the Asan Police Station,

254
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:36,520
and I got a call that the investigation team is already on their way.

255
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,530
Yes, sir.

256
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,180
Let me ask you again.

257
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:49,770
Did anyone come to your office after the exam paper was ready?

258
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,630
A student did come.

259
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,770
Was it Kang Seon Ho again?

260
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,310
Yes.

261
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:05,190
Yes, he did. But he left after talking with me.

262
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,610
He was with me all along, you can even check the CCTV.

263
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,330
The laptop you handed in for fingerprint analysis

264
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,140
also looked like Kang Seon Ho's.

265
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,650
Are you perhaps doing any personal work

266
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,180
with Kang Seon Ho?

267
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,150
There shouldn't be anything like that, Professor Yu Dong Man.

268
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,010
For now, go back.

269
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,540
Yes.

270
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:55,680
Are you perhaps doing any personal work with Kang Seon Ho?

271
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,780
There shouldn't be anything like that, Professor Yu Dong Man.

272
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,160
Ah, my head hurts.

273
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,340
What is this now?

274
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,420
What the hell—

275
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:32,610
Professor Yu Dong Man, we're from the Asan Police investigation team.

276
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,060
What is that behind your back?

277
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,330
No, it's nothing.

278
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,330
Professor—

279
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,200
Professor.

280
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,980
Professor. Let go off me.

281
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,620
Tell them something.

282
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,640
It's not true, right?

283
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,750
Professor!

284
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,690
Wait a moment.

285
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,490
I'll take Professor Yu in my car and follow you.

286
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,510
This is an arrest without a warrant.

287
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,730
Since we don't even have solid proof,

288
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,070
I'm saying that we don't need to show the students this kind of situation.

289
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:28,540
And I'm saying that if this talk gets any longer, I'll make an issue of it.

290
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,440
If you understand, let's end this conversation.

291
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,480
Do you know where Asan Police Station is?

292
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,810
Stop First

293
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,370
You don't have to do this.

294
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,800
I told you we should go on a drive.

295
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,030
But it's a little bright out and the roads are wide.

296
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,880
Well, the accident has happened.

297
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,250
It is a case not an accident.

298
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,230
It is an accident.

299
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,600
It is an accident that suddenly happened to you.

300
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:50,090
Was this accident caused because I didn't grab the brakes?

301
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,700
I just wonder if they are doing this to stop me

302
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,880
because I don't stop.

303
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,420
Simjeong-ro

304
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:10,670
I don't know if this is right, but there is a day that I regret the most in my whole life.

305
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,480
That day, the dream was so ominous

306
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,970
that I told my husband to skip work and take the day off so we could go to the ocean.

307
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,490
But he just wouldn't budge.

308
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,790
He was like that. No matter how hard I tried,

309
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,030
in the end he would always do what he wanted.

310
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,060
But had I known I wouldn't make it to the ocean after planning to go that weekend,

311
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,560
I should have broken his legs to stop him from going to work.

312
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,490
I should have done whatever it took.

313
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,800
I should have come up with something to do.

314
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,030
I regret it every day.

315
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:58,260
So forgiving

316
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,050
and making up is only possible if you're alive.

317
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,460
Don't you think so?

318
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:33,570
♫ If someone were to ask me, ♫

319
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:39,790
♫ who is in my heart? My answer would be you ♫

320
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:46,220
♫ Stay with me. Stay hold me in your mind ♫

321
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:53,990
♫ n the night, wanting to see you, speaking to myself, ♫

322
00:30:53,990 --> 00:31:02,380
♫ I love you so much, more than myself ♫

323
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:08,700
♫ You descended like a star ♫

324
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,230
Lee Ju Won

325
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,350
You can't deny it! A money envelope was even found in the room.

326
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,470
That's what is so suspicious.

327
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,280
- It's too much like planted evidence.
- That's true.

328
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,260
He was the Investigation Department's legend.

329
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,590
He wouldn't have done it sloppily like this.

330
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,960
Exactly. Professor Yu Dong Man doesn't seem the type who would do that.

331
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,380
- Right, Sunbae?
- How do we know a person fully?

332
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,600
He'll get expelled or dismissed.

333
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,090
Will he get expelled?

334
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,020
You mean we are going to do it properly, right?

335
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,310
You mean we will go till the end no matter what?

336
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,770
Of course, we have to go till the end, you jerk.

337
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,530
What exactly do you want to hear from me?

338
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,270
Kang Seon Ho.

339
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,720
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

340
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,040
They have just now started the investigation.

341
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,110
Why are they not allowing even us to see the CCTV footage?

342
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,860
See clearly, someone has turned the CCTV

343
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,030
so there's nothing that was caught on camera.

344
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,690
Right. Seeing that they know the angle so well, they must be an insider.

345
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,960
Who is your accomplice?

346
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Whether it is a student or not, you must have done this so that the camera doesn't capture you receiving the money from that person, right?

347
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,060
Inside job!

348
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,610
Professor, just confess your crime.

349
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,120
The CCTV is being analyzed right now anyway, and we'll be issued a warrant!

350
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,200
Dong Man!

351
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,960
Why did you come here ,Team Leader? It's embarrassing.

352
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,000
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

353
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,920
So you know it's embarrassing? You know it's embarrassing?

354
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,460
No matter how big an idiot you are, I know you wouldn't do such a thing.

355
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,440
These jerks!

356
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,860
I know, right? What do they want me to do?

357
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,150
What, you jerk?

358
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,990
If they were going to frame me, they should have done it better.

359
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,430
So you suspect someone.

360
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,370
Who is it? What is it?

361
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:12,050
Are they really doing this to stop me from doing more?

362
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,000
Tell me so that I can understand, you jerk! It's so frustrating.

363
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,040
Team Leader, I have a request.

364
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,310
Here, have the tea.

365
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,730
I heard that you were in Professor Yu's room with him

366
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,140
the day before the day the paper got leaked.

367
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,230
Yes, I did go to see him for a moment.

368
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,820
May I ask you why?

369
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,880
There was something I didn't understand from forensics class.

370
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,990
I wanted to ask him about that.

371
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,400
You went to Professor's office over

372
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,590
ten times this month alone.

373
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,610
Was it all to ask questions about the forensics class?

374
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,940
Oh! You shouldn't have such an expression when the police question you.

375
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,960
Student Kang Seon Ho.

376
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,830
Let's see. It's an arrest without a warrant,

377
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:27,670
so he'll be in custody for another 36 hours.

378
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:34,180
You'd better hurry and prove his innocence before he's put in a tougher spot.

379
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,700
(TN: Police can hold someone arrested without a warrant for 72 hours)

380
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,170
Then, go now.

381
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,680
Yes, sir.

382
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,890
Scientific Investigation Research Society

383
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,120
It was you who did it, right?

384
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,480
Go study.

385
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:11,930
I will definitely find evidence that it was you.

386
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:19,360
Try it. I don't know if a kid like you could do it though.

387
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,580
Seon Ho.

388
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,330
Honestly, it is a bit strange.

389
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,590
All he had to do was score well on the test by himself. Why would he spread the final exam paper?

390
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,610
Even the police are investigating this case, so

391
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,550
wouldn't they have noticed what is strange?

392
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,110
Since they found the money envelope,

393
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,420
I'm sure they'll investigate with the evidence, not the circumstantial evidence.

394
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,930
Then they will miss the golden time.

395
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:56,350
- Still, I think the police will look for the culprit among the students first.
- True.

396
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,020
That is me.

397
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,090
- Huh?
- What?

398
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,470
It is you?

399
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:09,230
I went to see Professor Yu Dong Man in his office that night.

400
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,630
What?

401
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,780
But you didn't leak the paper, right bro?

402
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,080
Of course, Seon Ho didn't do it.

403
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,860
It wasn't Professor Yu Dong Man either. He is falsely accused.

404
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:26,890
I... have to catch the culprit.

405
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,610
That is why...

406
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,970
if you guys help me...

407
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,860
Never mind. It's exam period.

408
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,870
I'll go ahead.

409
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,450
Hey, Kang Seon Ho!

410
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,470
What are you doing? Something like that happened to you.

411
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,690
Of course, you should do it with us.

412
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,930
Exams? Exams? What is so important about that now?!

413
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,570
Yes, Seon Ho. I may not be of help, but

414
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,500
I also want to help.

415
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,340
You would have done the same for me.

416
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,840
Yes, bro. Don't make us upset.

417
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,890
We're friends.

418
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,950
You guys...

419
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,290
Hey, don't be emotional. We don't have time.

420
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,190
Okay.

421
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,830
Don't be emotional. We don't have time.

422
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,870
What should we start with?

423
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,600
♫ Fly away facing tomorrow Now ♫

424
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,180
♫ Fly away high until the end ♫

425
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,530
♫ The hot sun isn't in that sky there ♫

426
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:56,790
♫ I found it (I found it) in my heart (in my heart) ♫

427
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,720
I think everyone in our grade bought a copy of the exam.

428
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,640
Beom Tae and Jun Wuk, you two go around questioning people.

429
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,780
People who didn't buy the exam paper or borrowed it from someone who bought it.

430
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,290
Among them, those who were likely to have bought one but didn't.

431
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,770
Let's narrow down the suspects by questioning them first.

432
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,010
Also, find out Dong Gu's alibi since he sold it.

433
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,050
- Roger that.
- Roger that.

434
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,670
What about us?

435
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,930
We should go to the scene of the crime.

436
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,570
The evidence is always available on the scene of the crime.

437
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,090
Let's go.

438
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,280
There obviously is a CCTV camera here, but they say they didn't find the culprit?

439
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:47,620
We will get the answer if we look at this just once.

440
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,330
Let's go for it then.

441
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,380
No.

442
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,240
Asan Police Station believes that there could be an insider or an assistant who helped out in this case.

443
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,980
Even professors are not allowed to approach the case.

444
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,630
- Then how about seeing it here at least—
- Oh ho!

445
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,300
I said you can't. Hurry up and leave!

446
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:12,390
It's because I thought I saw someone tampering with the CCTV outside Professor Yu Dong Man's office.

447
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,240
You saw that?

448
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,000
Was it a male or a female?

449
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,650
It was dark no I couldn't see clearly.

450
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,400
Get out. Go, go, go.

451
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,040
Go out quickly.

452
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,350
So someone really was messing with the CCTV.

453
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,180
Not bad.

454
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,990
The others should be done with the questioning, too. Let's go.

455
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,780
L-Let go of this and talk.

456
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,320
Yes.

457
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Sh-Sh-Shall we go?

458
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Let's go.

459
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,590
Park Dong Gu

460
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,800
Dong Gu got his hands on the paper

461
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,370
on Monday around 12.

462
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,120
And he saw it sitting on the printer in the residence hall,

463
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,270
and he has admitted to making a copy.

464
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,900
There are seven people who didn't buy a copy of the paper.

465
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,130
The salesman Dong Gu, Kang Hui, Jae Gyeong,

466
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,920
Seon Ho, Min Gyu,

467
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,100
and Seong Su and Hae Ju.

468
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,420
Wait. Cha Seong Su and Ahn Hae Ju didn't buy it?

469
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,620
Right.

470
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:40,600
I don't know about the others, but those two should have bought it.

471
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,670
What is more shocking is that more than eighty percent of the students bought the paper.

472
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,520
Park Dong Gu should be a salesman instead of becoming a policeman.

473
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,920
Then the suspects have been reduced to two people.

474
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,120
I'll meet Hae Ju.

475
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,460
Then, Jun Wuk and Beom Tae, you guys meet Seong Su.

476
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,290
I'll try to find a way to get the CCTV footage again.

477
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,720
We will be able to save Professor Yu Dong Man, right?

478
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,700
Are you going to keep being uncooperative Mr. Yu Dong Man?

479
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,700
Mr. Yu Dong Man!

480
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,180
Forensic Science Room

481
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,620
I met Ahn Hae Ju.

482
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,150
The one who came out of the printer room was wearing a fluorescent watch.

483
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,530
Check Cha Seong Su's watch.

484
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,790
If it is a fluorescent color, then he is the first one to find the paper.

485
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,470
It's exam period, aren't you studying?

486
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,150
I have to go somewhere now. Let's talk next time.

487
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,960
Am I...

488
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,500
Am I next time again?

489
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,560
I... like you.

490
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,690
I'm not asking you to answer immediately.

491
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,390
I am just saying that that's how I feel about you.

492
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,480
Okay.

493
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,150
Then let's talk about it next time.

494
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:56,390
The 41st Cheongram Sports Festival

495
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,320
Okay, let's talk now instead of next time.

496
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,930
Min Gyu, I like someone.

497
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:20,030
So, I am only so worried about him being upset that I can't even see that you are upset.

498
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,290
Who is that?

499
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,480
Kang Seon Ho?

500
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,490
I'll go ahead.

501
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,820
You want me to show you the CCTV footage?

502
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,950
Yes, sir.

503
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:48,690
I can't but I thought you could see it.

504
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,460
It is a burdensome request.

505
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,310
I'm sorry.

506
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,590
I know it's burdensome but I still came.

507
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,400
Why is that?

508
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:05,020
Because it is better to do it than to not do it.

509
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,760
Sometimes not doing it could be better.

510
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,650
We can't avoid it even if we want to, and we can't change anything by doing nothing.

511
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:21,980
We can face whatever it is only if we proceed

512
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,240
is what Professor Yu Dong Man taught me.

513
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:30,560
I am worried that you might fall if you keep looking forward and proceed.

514
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,340
But falling isn't failure. Isn't it the process of learning how to walk properly?

515
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:42,580
When we first went to the shooting range, I remember what you told us.

516
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,010
"We police must use our guns for protecting people"

517
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,360
"and not to kill people."

518
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:58,810
Can't you trigger the gun so that I can protect Professor Yu Dong Man?

519
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,190
I've checked for the fluorescent watch at 3 o'clock.

520
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:21,110
Done with checking at 9 o'clock, too.

521
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,540
What are you guys doing?

522
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,570
No matter what angle I see it from, it is fluorescent color.

523
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,320
What?

524
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:42,190
I heard the one who first found the exam papers was caught on the CCTV.

525
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,750
Hey, there's no CCTV there. What nonsense are you—

526
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,130
So it is you.

527
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,600
You have the right to remain silent and—

528
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,700
Stay put.

529
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,690
You have the chance to explain and you can call a lawyer.

530
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,000
You have the right to question the legality of this arrest in court...

531
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,540
That's not it. Ah!

532
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,230
You can take it up with the professors!

533
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,270
Stay put!

534
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,700
Crazy jerks!

535
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,920
I think you broke my bone!

536
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,600
Forensic Science Room

537
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:36,830
Yes, Beom Tae?

538
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,850
Seong Su was the first one to find the paper.

539
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:42,820
But he said there was someone in the printing room first.

540
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,450
What?

541
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,980
Could I have a word with you?

542
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,180
If you have anything to say, tell me quickly and go.

543
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,520
I told you, right?

544
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,400
That I would definitely find evidence that you were the one who did it.

545
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,840
The night the exam papers were leaked,

546
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:19,060
we've obtained testimony from Cha Seong Su that you were in the room first.

547
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:24,750
That's not enough evidence.

548
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,590
That is why I am planning on finding the evidence that we can see soon.

549
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,890
So,

550
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:40,700
I will save

551
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,680
Professor Yu Dong Man, your mentor.

552
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:51,800
Do you really think getting Mentor

553
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,080
out of there is good for him?

554
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:01,730
This time it was exam papers, but aren't you afraid of

555
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,050
what he will be framed for next time?

556
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:10,930
No, I am not afraid.

557
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:15,920
Because that is exactly what those bastards want.

558
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,330
To scare off me and the professor

559
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,220
so that we

560
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,750
are unable to proceed with this investigation.

561
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,870
Professor and I will never do

562
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:39,290
what those bastards want.

563
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,120
Will you really...

564
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,660
be able to handle it?

565
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,480
Will you be able to be next to

566
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,390
Mentor till the end without running away?

567
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,380
Yes.

568
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,160
He is better than me.

569
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,550
Did you confirm it, Team Leader?

570
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:31,980
It's true Cheol Jin withdrew 10 million won from his account.

571
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,820
What exactly is happening?

572
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,890
Did Cheol Jin get blackmailed or something?

573
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,720
I understand. Bye.

574
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,510
Let me make another call.

575
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,500
Hello.

576
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,260
It's me.

577
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:07,920
We've obtained testimony, but not a decisive blow.

578
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,850
It's strong, it's strong.

579
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,590
Where in the world did Seon Ho go?

580
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,020
Let's find the final evidence now.

581
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,030
- What is that?
- What is it?

582
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,300
What is that?

583
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,660
What is that?

584
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,790
Did you find the culprit?

585
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,000
Yes.

586
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,490
I have something to report.

587
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,190
Stop it there.

588
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:05,360
What? Only his hand is visible.

589
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,790
Wait a moment.

590
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,240
I'm sure it is a man's hand.

591
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,150
The culprit is a man.

592
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:23,330
With this, we can't find out who turned the camera.

593
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,250
What are you doing?

594
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,110
I can see, I can see.

595
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,880
We found it.

596
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,870
But isn't that the new academic advisor who just arrived?

597
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:59,680
Yes. It's Professor Park Cheol Jin.

598
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,920
Let's go.

599
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,790
Did Cheol Jin get blackmailed or something?

600
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,020
Mentor.

601
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,860
There are only two.

602
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,010
No! Stop!

603
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,710
It still hurts a lot when it rains.

604
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,600
I turn around scared that someone is standing behind me.

605
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,210
So...

606
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:49,120
Mentor!

607
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,030
...don't leave me alone.

608
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,560
I'll show you that I'm worthy enough to be your partner.

609
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,040
I have a very bad feeling about this case.

610
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,230
I am the new academic advisor as of today.

611
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:01,910
What?

612
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:04,750
Cheol Jin requested it of me so that he can stay by your side.

613
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:08,320
Hereafter, I will always be behind you so

614
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,040
you don't have to be scared.

615
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,500
You won't give up, right Mentor?

616
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,310
You really won't give up chasing those guys, right?

617
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,640
The report...

618
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,520
let's write it.

619
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,350
Really?

620
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,230
I got the pass for us to go out from Professor Seo Sang Hak.

621
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,410
The taxi is also ready. Let's go quickly.

622
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,310
Quickly.

623
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:10,800
Yes, this is Seo Sang Hak.

624
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,810
What did you say?

625
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:24,280
The final exam papers were leaked at the Police University.

626
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,480
The cradle of justice, Police University.

627
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,080
The ideology overshadowed by corruption,

628
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,190
KCS News reports.

629
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,460
It has been less than a year since Professor Yu began at the Police University.

630
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,820
He gave out the answers for his own class exam.

631
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:42,650
According to Asan Police Station, Mr. Yu initially denied all the charges

632
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:46,820
but eventually confessed during the investigation.

633
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,420
What do they mean by confessing suddenly?

634
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,940
Professor didn't do it.

635
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,740
Ahjussi, please go a bit faster.

636
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,440
Okay.

637
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,560
The police suspect the possibility of solicitation

638
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,420
and will further investigate to find out what deals might have been made.

639
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,380
This is Lee Myeon Seok of KCS.

640
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,810
This is a case that is still being investigated so nothing is confirmed yet.

641
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,750
We can't give any explanation right now.

642
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:25,740
I apologize.

643
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,790
That's...

644
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,860
Oh!

645
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,250
Where's Academic Advisor Park Cheol Jin?!

646
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:35,150
Who did you receive the money from?

647
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,490
I don't know, I said.

648
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,490
They told me they'd give me cash if I give them the exam paper.

649
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,660
You agreed to write a report.

650
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,330
What are you doing now?

651
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,510
What are you saying suddenly?

652
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,490
Hello.

653
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,260
It's me.

654
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,910
I wondered if you are all right.

655
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:49,240
Since you picked up the call, I guess you are fine.

656
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,480
Then it's fine.

657
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,520
Mentor.

658
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,840
In this situation too,

659
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,760
why would you worry about me?

660
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:07,540
I told you I would protect you.

661
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:15,520
I am keeping that damn promise now, you jerk.

662
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:49,350
I leaked the final exam.

663
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,860
You bastard, what are you doing?

664
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,050
You should have been the one to handcuff me.

665
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,780
Hey! Park Cheol Jin!

666
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:18,560
I wanted to make some money

667
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,100
and here I am.

668
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,820
Hey, punk!

669
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:28,230
You should have quit when you found the listening device!

670
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:32,840
Even though I acted like I lost my memory, you wouldn't put on the brakes.

671
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,100
You jerk! Won't you shut up?

672
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:41,350
Senior Inspector Yu Dong Man. Mentor.

673
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:47,220
You can stop watching my back now.

674
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,880
You crazy bastard!

675
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,730
♫ If a person whom I don't even know ♫

676
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:25,920
♫ asks how I feel ♫

677
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:33,090
♫ Saying there's no reason ♫

678
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:38,240
♫ I like everything, ♫

679
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,230
♫ I just like it ♫

680
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,890
Police University
♫ We begin a beginning which has no end ♫

681
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:47,810
I didn't come to Police University

682
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,160
to learn from people like Yu Dong Man.

683
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,730
Who tipped off the news?

684
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,990
If you are doing this because of me, don't do it ever again.

685
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:55,360
Where are you touching?

686
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,260
- She smiled.
- Don't smile.

687
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,590
So it's not you, right?

688
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:02,490
If it is you, then I will really never see you again.

689
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,500
I need to be a part of that investigation.

690
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,240
And I like you, Kang Seon Ho.

691
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,930
What you learned wasn't even the standard rules, so forget about it.

692
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:15,460
I don't want to. I had a hard time learning it. Why would I forget it?

693
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,980
Okay then, punk.

694
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,990
The burner phone's been turned on!

695
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:20,840
It was you?

696
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,300
♫ asks how I feel ♫
