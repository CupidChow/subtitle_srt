00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,910
But how did a hacker end up in Police University?

Episode 12

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,710
The policeman Yu Dong Man who connived with hacker Kang Seon Ho.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,610
Yu Dong Man.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,180
Is it thanks to this person?

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,840
Who are you?

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,250
Who the hell are you?!

14
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,190
Professor Yu Dong Man

15
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,070
Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil

16
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,690
Are you getting off work now, professors?

17
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,990
If these files are exposed, then it will be the end for you and Yu Dong Man.

18
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,800
No.

19
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,960
Put your phone down.

20
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,250
Even now, the person who can save you now is not Yu Dong Man

21
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,380
but me.

22
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,530
Stranger
Yoon

23
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,840
Professor Yu Dong Man

24
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,330
Do just one thing that I order you to. Then I will delete these files for you.

25
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,570
You decide, Kang Seon Ho.

26
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,470
Whether you will hold my hands and survive,

27
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,370
or

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,830
whether you will fall off the cliff with Yu Dong Man.

29
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,080
Police University

30
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,520
Yu Dong Man

31
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,700
- Yes, tell me.
- The number you told me doesn't exist now.

32
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,960
What about the last received base station? Did you find out?

33
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,840
Yes. The positions are overlapping, but it's near the Police University.

34
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,900
Okay. Bye.

35
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,070
Aren't you going to the meeting?

36
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,960
Just a moment.

37
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,970
What's wrong? The investigation was over and the culprit was caught too.

38
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,060
I am just asking because your office lights are on every night.

39
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,690
What about you?

40
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,360
The Judo club room's lights also stay on all night.

41
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,620
So it's not just me watching you.

42
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,550
It's just that the seniors will graduate soon and be out in the field.

43
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,820
I'm busy trying to teach them as much as possible.

44
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,060
Go home early. It's dangerous at night.

45
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,840
Then I'll leave work on time today while the sun is up.

46
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,520
Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil

47
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,090
You're the same as me, leaving work.

48
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,130
Let's go.

49
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,460
Let's eat quickly and go to get seats. We have to sit in front.

50
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,230
I know. In the special lecture, I heard that the talk about the field is so good.

51
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,860
Do you know who the senior that will give us the lecture today is?

52
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,770
Of course.

53
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,690
Jun Wuk. I don't know everything.

54
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,110
- Where's Seon Ho?
- Seon Ho said he isn't feeling well so he won't eat breakfast.

55
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,870
Why isn't he feeling well? How? How sick is he?

56
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,800
Kang Hui. I don't know everything.

57
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,020
Let's eat quickly.

58
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,290
Professor Yu Dong Man

59
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,710
He isn't even picking up my calls. Where did he go?

60
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,940
- Is the lecturer from the goverment office?
- Not sure.

61
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,300
You go ahead.

62
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,190
It's almost time for the lecture. Aren't you going?

63
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,800
Yes, I will.

64
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,920
But, did you not see Seon Ho?

65
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,860
Seemed like he left before to attend the lecture.

66
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,330
Oh, is that so?

67
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,960
Let's go too. We might be late.

68
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,700
Okay.

69
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,310
Professor's Room

70
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,630
Professor Yu Dong Man

71
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,800
- Yes, Boem Tae.
- Seon Ho. What are you doing instead of coming for the lecture?

72
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,210
- For what?
- I misunderstood who gave me the bracelet

74
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,080
and received it and †hen returned it and it was such a fuss.

75
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,060
- Did Seon Ho give you that?
- Huh?

76
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,460
Yes.

77
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,440
Hey. That's so tacky.

78
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,710
- Hey. it's not.
- It is tacky.

79
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,500
Hey, it's cute and red.

80
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,730
Oh! Seon Ho!

81
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,100
2021 lecture for invited Police University graduates
What is justice?

82
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,200
Here. I saved seats. Come here.

83
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,020
Hey Min Gyu. There are three seats.

84
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,450
You didn't even answer my calls. Where were you?

85
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,550
I checked the phone late because I went to see Professor.

86
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,690
Are you feeling better? I heard you didn't feel well.

87
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,670
Yes, I'm feeling better.

88
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,820
Looks like the lecture is starting.

89
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,630
Oh, Department Head Han.

90
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,670
Oh! Inspector Yu.

91
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,890
The culprit was caught.

92
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,320
Caught you say?

93
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,150
You know it right when they are caught. The facial expression in that moment can't lie.

94
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,350
Inspector Yu. You worked hard.

95
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,550
Today's special lecture host is a graduate of the 5th class of National Police University.

96
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,670
He's the current head of investigation at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

97
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,390
Chief Han Jeong Sik.

98
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,400
Please give him a round of applause.

99
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,820
Nice to meet you. I am Han Jeong Sik.

100
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,220
What is the matter? You even asked to have tea together.

101
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,450
I just didn't have any class, so...

102
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,970
I see.

103
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,840
Professor,

104
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,920
it's been about 30 years since you came to this school right?

105
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,060
Oh. Wow.

106
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,310
It's been 28 years.

107
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,030
I should retire as soon as I hit 30 years, shouldn't I?

108
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,050
Well then,

109
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,190
you must have taught half of the police force.

110
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,860
Yes. Well.

111
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,490
I still have quite a few of my juniors and students working as officers right now.

112
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,450
Oh. Today's lecture is being given by my junior, too.

113
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,290
Junior?

114
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,910
Yes.

115
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,210
There is one symbol that is the most representative of our school.

116
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,690
Who can tell me what that is?

117
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,120
It's the Justice Tower!

118
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
Correct.

119
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,720
The Justice Tower signifies an upright and just mindset.

120
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,230
So to the advanced police force,

121
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,730
it carries a very weighty message.

122
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,760
What is justice?

123
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,250
Justice.

124
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,300
What does it mean to all of you?

125
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,780
To me, it means catching the bad guys

126
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,940
and protecting the weak.

127
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,750
Put simply, that was justice to me.

128
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,650
But after I became a police officer,

129
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,480
we caught a brutal serial killer

130
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,450
who murdered ten wealthy elderly people.

131
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,000
When we asked him why he did it, he answered,

132
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,670
"The poor are poor because of the rich."

133
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,170
"So if I killed the rich,"

134
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,730
"I thought I could resolve inequality."

135
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,610
Yes.

136
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,880
I was like that, too.

137
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,540
Even for those bad guys that I wanted to beat up,

138
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,850
there is a thing called justice.

139
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,950
It was shocking and amazing.

140
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,640
Back then, I thought,

141
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,740
"What exactly is this thing called 'justice'?"

142
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,090
We're all human beings,

143
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,040
but how could perceptions of justice be this different?

144
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,020
In fact, justice is neither good

145
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,010
nor evil.

146
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,460
Justice is a neutral concept

147
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,820
that includes both good and evil.

148
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,180
Wouldn't a law that is based on justice

149
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,250
be considered evil by some?

150
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,890
Nevertheless, human beings seek and yearn for justice.

151
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,350
When they realize their sense of justice is wrong,

152
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,610
because they are human, they are willing to risk their lives.

153
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,670
Let's talk about it this way.

154
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,000
You are now all police officers.

155
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,710
And you're chasing a murderer.

156
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,880
But there is a river in front of the killer

157
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,590
And the killer steals a boat and gets away.

158
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,600
So if you want to catch him,

159
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,250
you have to also steal a boat and go after him.

160
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,910
What would you do then?

161
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,250
Would you steal the boat to catch the killer?

162
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,550
Would you uphold the law

163
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,320
even if it meant letting the criminal get away?

164
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,470
This is Noh Beom-tae from the 41st division!

165
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,000
I wouldn't steal the ship. I would borrow it from the owner.

166
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,140
I would ride my jet ski and go after them.

167
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,110
Sure.

168
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,250
In this case—

169
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,950
I would fire my gun. Once towards the sky.

170
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,810
And once towards the fleeing boat.

171
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,800
And if they didn't stop, I would fire once more towards the criminal.

172
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,360
Who did you learn that from?

173
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,690
The student next to her.

174
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,320
What was your name?

175
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,670
Kang Seon Ho from the 41st.

176
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,150
What would you do?

177
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,550
I...

178
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,960
I don't know.

179
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,430
Good. Sit down.

180
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,970
It's okay not to know

181
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,980
since you're still first-year students.

182
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,200
But in your hearts, each of you has an answer.

183
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,630
To some people, police officers,

184
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,500
even if they have to break the law to get the bad guy are enforcing justice.

185
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,700
And some others will think that because you are police officers

186
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,900
you should never commit a crime under any circumstance, even to achieve justice.

187
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,500
So, to my juniors and future police officers,

188
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,850
I want to say this.

189
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,820
What exactly is justice?

190
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,720
Ask yourself this question constantly.

191
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,310
And come up with your own answers.

192
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,930
Every moment. Every second. The answer to that wavering question

193
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
should always be in your heart.

194
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,800
I'm sure everyone will be better police officers than we are now

195
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,410
because you are proud students of the Police University.

196
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,010
I'm sure you can find that answer.

197
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,670
What is justice?

198
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,550
Even without stealing the boat,

199
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,200
what's the strategy to catch the killer?

200
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,200
I'm not sure. Wouldn't you have to swim?

201
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:17,900
Using common sense, it is impossible to catch someone escaping on a boat by swimming.

202
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,090
It is off-putting to say we must somehow abide by the law and catch the criminal.

203
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:29,900
Is suggesting a futile way to do this truly justice for the organization?

204
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,390
- Chief Han Jeon Sik?
- Yes.

205
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,020
I know him well.

206
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,310
When I first started off as an officer,

207
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,030
he was the chief of our station.

208
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,480
Even though he was younger than me, he was so stiff.

209
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,400
Anyway, then and now I still have no luck.

210
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,420
But why are you suddenly asking about the chief?

211
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,110
Oh, I'm just a little curious.

212
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,240
This jerk, I'm so busy I could die.

213
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,630
Because you made a huge fuss about Cheol Jin and Go Deok Bae needing to be put in different detention centers,

214
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,620
you have no idea what I went through to send Go Deok Bae to the southeast detention center!

215
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,250
Why are you calling me and getting me irritated, punk?

216
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,520
Okay. Okay. Well go eat then.

217
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,580
Aigoo. This...

218
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,130
Shall we have a cup of coffee?

219
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,900
Aren't you leaving?

220
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,020
No, let's go.

221
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,510
I didn't know you gave lectures like that.

222
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,010
It's a lecture at my alma mater.

223
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,500
So I have to do it even if I don't want to.

224
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,610
Ah... Alma mater...

225
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,040
Oh yeah. Among the first year students,

226
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,040
Kang Seon Ho was it?

227
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,130
That student was entertaining.

228
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,070
It looks like he has a good foundation.

229
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,900
If you raise him well, it'll look good for you.

230
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,280
Who's raising whom?

231
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,570
He's coming up well by himself.

232
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,530
He must be a student that you cherish.

233
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,520
There's affection in your voice.

234
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,310
Oh! How do you know Professor Choi?

235
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,420
- Who?
- Professor Choi Hui Su.

236
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,310
I saw you meeting with her recently.

237
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,220
Are you talking about Professor Choi from the Judo club here?

238
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,470
She's just my junior's wife.

239
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,010
It was Inspector Lee Ju Won.

240
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,000
He was a police officer. Didn't you know?

241
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,970
Memorial For Police Officers Who Died On Duty

242
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,750
Search

243
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,510
Lee Joo Won

244
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,580
Lee Joo Won, may he rest in peace.

245
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,960
June 8th, at an entertainment bar located in Soowon, an officer was apprehending members of a gang who were operating a gambling den.

246
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,360
He was stabbed with a knife by one of the members, and with a wound 17cm deep, he was transported to the hospital but passed away from excessive bleeding.

247
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Gambling den?

248
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,500
Incoming call: Kang Seon Ho

249
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,390
You called me to tell me something but you aren't talking at all.

250
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,240
Why are you frowning again?

251
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,450
I think you are frowning too.

252
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,470
You were busy the whole day too.

253
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,860
This jerk. Are you looking at only me?

254
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:52,530
I am... I am still confirming this.

255
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,540
What is it about?

256
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,390
No. I'm not sure about this yet, so

257
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,680
don't get worked up after hearing it. Got it?

258
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,450
I think the illegal gambling ring case isn't over yet.

259
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,650
I think the culprit is still out there.

260
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,010
The culprit who ran away that time?

261
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,330
Not the sidekick.

262
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,860
The real head behind all this that Go Deok Bae tried to hide.

263
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:32,150
I found the burner phone that he threw away when we caught him.

264
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,320
I got a phone number from that.

265
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,640
I'm still looking into it, so wait.

266
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,540
Are you surprised?

267
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,910
- No.
- That's right, punk!

268
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,060
Whether it is two or three culprits,

269
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,470
you and I are going to catch all of them and lock them up!

270
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,080
What's there to worry about? Huh?

271
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,140
Professor.

272
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,420
Nothing will happen to us if we just catch the culprit, right?

273
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,160
Everything will be alright if we just catch the culprit, right?

274
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,160
This jerk... Why are you saying such obvious things aloud?

275
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,790
Wait and watch.

276
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,900
I will end all of this in one week.

277
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,700
You just have to trust me and attend school well.

278
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,770
I will definitely ask you for your help when I need it.

279
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,550
Stranger
Yoon

280
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,170
Whether you'll fall off the cliff with Yu Dong Man.

281
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,860
This account does not exist.

282
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,190
This account does not exist.

283
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,620
Kang Seon Ho, is this how you are going to be?

284
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,760
Stop it now.

285
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,210
I feel full just by watching you eat.

286
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:27,100
Me too. I feel happy just by watching you eat.

287
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,870
Wow! Are you going to eat all this alone?

288
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,010
Hey! Don't eat.

289
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,370
- Huh?
- Don't eat it. It's all mine.

290
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,680
Am I your idol?

291
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,300
Till when are you going to just watch me from afar?

292
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,490
This is really very frustrating.

293
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,940
Do you still call yourselves men?

294
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,790
Justice
Honor

295
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,010
We put our faith in those who pass through these halls.

296
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,450
Justice
Honor

297
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,520
All we have to do is win one round.

298
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,610
The loser gives up for now.

299
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,440
- Like a man.
- Like a man.

300
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,360
Am I your idol? Till when are you going to just watch me from afar?

301
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,850
Rock, paper,

302
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,850
- scissors.
- Scissors.

303
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,420
- Ah! No!
- Yes! Let's go.

304
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,440
It looks like they decided that Jun Wuk can confess first by fair play.

305
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,910
Ah! Fair play is tough.

306
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,210
You are fine today. Yesterday you didn't seem well.

307
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:34,050
I'm just trying to cheer up till the end.

308
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,700
Then recharge yourself.

309
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,870
You told me you're going to cheer up till the end.

310
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,210
Then I should charge myself fully before I leave.

311
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,770
Let's go together to my mom when we don't have classes.

312
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,250
- Seriously?
- We have to tell her.

313
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,940
I want to tell her to stop gambling now that

314
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,600
her daughter is a police officer and so is her daughter's boyfriend.

315
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:19,590
Ah, are we not police officers yet?

316
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,740
Nowadays you come to me first.

317
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,700
How is it? Do I look moist? What about my wrinkles?

318
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,290
Aigoo. I almost mistook you for a student.

319
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:02,420
I can see light coming from your skin. Are you done with your classes?

320
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,850
Can't you tell? I've showered and I'm glowing refreshingly now.

321
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,800
Ah, then now that you are glowing refreshingly shall we eat together?

322
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,370
Huh? What to do? I have plans today.

323
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,100
Plans? Where are you going?

324
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,260
Seoul?

325
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,070
No, Daejeon.

326
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,930
Why Daejeon?

327
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,400
Are you curious about where I'm going or whom I'm meeting?

328
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,870
Both.

329
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,030
What is this? You're making my heart flutter.

330
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:42,200
Then I'll drop you off. Let's go in my car.

331
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,810
I said it wrong. It's not fluttering, it's scary.

332
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,170
What's gotten into you suddenly?

333
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:55,260
I have something to ask you while we drive.

334
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,440
Let' talk tomorrow. Today is not possible. See you tomorrow.

335
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,820
No.

336
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,460
Where is she going early in the morning?

337
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,930
What is it?

338
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,060
Let's just confirm. Just confirm.

339
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:01,790
Chicken! Eat up.

340
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,850
Eat up. Eat it all.

341
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,510
Because I'm buying it with my mom's card. See.

342
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,820
Hey! Eat. You should eat it.

343
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,690
But, Jun Wuk, why are you treating us? Did you decide to date that sunbae?

344
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:29,450
No. But, well, it will happen as soon as I confess.

345
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,750
Hey. If Jun Wuk gets rejected, he doesn't get another chance.

346
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,060
It's just better to do it after him.

347
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,380
- Right?
- Hmmm.

348
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,240
But if Jun Wuk doesn't get rejected, you don't get a chance at all.

349
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,200
Right.

350
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,070
- I don't want to eat.
- Why are you doing this?

351
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,940
- I won't eat.
- I was just kidding.

352
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,270
- You, eat a lot!
- Alright, alright.

353
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,220
Did you get pissed off already??

354
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,690
You eat a lot.

355
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,690
You're not even a kid.

356
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,600
Come here!

357
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,120
Seoul Southeast Detention Center

358
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,960
She told me she was going to Daejeon.

359
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,550
Seoul Southeast Detention Center.

360
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:40,310
You have no idea what I went through to send Go Deok Bae to the southeast detention center!

361
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,020
Have applications for festival support funds been submitted for each club?

362
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,480
Yes, all of them have been submitted except for the PR team.

363
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,820
PR team again. Professor Yu Dong Man, really.

364
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,990
I'll answer the call.

365
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,560
Yes, I am the administrator of Police University.

366
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,940
Forensic Science
Police

367
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,820
Professor. Professor!

368
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,590
- Huh?
- Your shoes.

369
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,230
Huh. Oh yes. Thank you.

370
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,690
Give it to me, I'll drive.

371
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,320
Forensic Science
Police

372
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,030
I'm sorry.

373
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,720
Please make way! Please make way!

374
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,520
Emergency Room

375
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,420
Ah! This jerk!

376
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,220
Team Leader! Are you alright?

377
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,570
Let's go quickly. Dong Man must be waiting.

378
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,720
This jerk!

379
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,220
Okay.

380
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,870
Okay, Professor.

381
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,420
Yes, I got it.

382
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,280
Professor's

383
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,440
surgery went well.

384
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,020
- Thank god.
- Thank god.

385
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,930
Ah, seriously. I was scared.

386
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,570
Are you surprised?

387
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,640
Whether it is two or three culprits, you and I are going to

388
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,090
catch all of them and lock them up.

389
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,600
What's there to worry about? Huh?

390
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,560
You just have to trust me and attend school well.

391
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,520
I will definitely ask you for your help when I need it.

392
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,360
- Are you the patient's guardian?
- Yes.

393
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,770
This is the patient's belonging.

394
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,730

395

Go Deok Bae arrest June the 24th

397
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,530
Go Deok Bae's fake phone is missing. Destruction? Why? The information leaked?

398
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,190
People who knew about the strategy: Choi Hui Su, Gwon Hyeok Pil, and Seo Sang Hak.

399
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,660
Choi Hui Su and Department Head Han meeting. Why? Lies?

402

Base station - Police University

403
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,420
Information leaked?

404
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,990
No way!

405
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,130
Informations leaked?
People who knew about the strategy: Choi Hui Su, Gwon Hyeok Pil, and Seo Sang Hak.

406
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,900
Fortunately, the surgery went well.

407
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,880
They said he would recover consciousness soon, so let's keep an eye on him a little longer.

408
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,680
Where did they say Professor Yu got into the accident?

409
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,530
It was in the Seoul suburbs.

410
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,400
Why did he go there?

411
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,790
I'm not sure.

412
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:28,250
Korean National Police University

413
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,270
Hello.

414
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,970
We also should go to the hospital today, right?

415
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,080
Yes, indeed.

416
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,800
A hit-and-run accident. What are they talking about?

417
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,970
Is the cyber forensics class canceled today?

418
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,850
Ah, that's right. I'm going to announce it now.

419
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,850
A what? A hit-and-run accident?

420
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,590
That's impossible.

421
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,270
The police investigation must have started.

422
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,640
I'm going to find the driver who disappeared soon.

423
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,230
No.

424
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,060
I have to find him.

425
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,000
That's not the moment for that. Since the cyber forensics class is canceled today, let's go see Professor Yu.

426
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,300
Yes, let's do so. I'll get permission to leave campus.

427
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,140
Aren't you going?

428
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,610
I have something to do before Professor Yu wakes up.

429
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,870
I won't ask what it is.

430
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,160
I'm not even asking why you are being like this,

431
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,420
because there must have a reason why you don't talk,

432
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,300
and there must be a reason for you doing this alone.

433
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,760
Just don't get hurt.

434
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,610
Be careful!

435
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,740
Hey!

436
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,270
Just one minute.

437
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,110
I need some courage right now.

438
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,610
Go backwards from here.

439
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,000
Just a little bit more. Here!

440
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,630
Here?

441
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,060
He is wearing a mask and a hat, we don't even see his face. Really.

442
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,480
This is driving me crazy.

443
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,500
Excuse me. Team leader, take a look. Here.

444
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,780
- What?
- Here, don't you see it?

445
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,960
It's a tattoo, right?

446
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:47,460
Wait! Shouldn't we buy and bring juice or something at least?

447
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,740
Professor Yu hasn't even woken up yet.

448
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,680
But, he will drink it when he does.

449
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,130
Let's go buy juice. It's rule number one when you visit someone in the hospital.

450
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,910
Yes!

451
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,810
Let's go, let's go.

452
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,650
Hello, Yu Dong Man.

453
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,500
You're not a nurse, right?

454
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,080
Hey! Kang Hui!

455
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,360
What is it? What's happening to you?

456
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,540
Did something happen, Kang Hui?

457
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,020
- What are you saying?
- On the day Professor Go was arrested

458
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,020
there's someone who ran away from the scene.

459
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,150
Let me go, you b*stard!

460
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,710
This b*stard.

461
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,550
I think that's him.

462
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,720
Black Net

463
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,450
I'll call the professors right now—

464
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,560
Don't. Not the professors.

465
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,300
I'm coming right away. Don't tell the professors.

466
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,480
For now, please stay by Professor Yu's side.

467
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,210
Office of investigation

468
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,270
This idiot.

469
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,440
Understood, hanging up.

470
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,780
Where did you say Inspector Yu's hospital was?

471
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,210
It's Korea University Hospital.

472
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:14,800
What about the hit-and-run driver?

473
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,400
Because the car that caused the accident was unregistered and the suspect hasn't been identified yet,

474
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,270
they said it would take some time.

475
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,920
Therefore, sir. This time, for this case, could you add personnel—

476
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,790
That...

477
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,720
Yes, Officer Ju. Yes.

478
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,900
Are you going now to see Professor Yu?

479
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,660
What's going on?

480
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,790
I have something to tell you.

481
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,420
If it's not something urgent, let's talk while going to the hospital.

482
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,500
No, I have to say it now before Professor Yu regains consciousness.

483
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,780
What do you mean?

484
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,050
Answer honestly.

485
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:12,600
Is there something I need to know about Professor Yu's case?

486
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,360
- What?
- I saw yesterday.

487
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,720
I saw Professor Yu following you outside.

488
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,600
Professor Yu and you were both in Seoul.

489
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,810
Hui Su.

490
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,620
Deal with Kang Seon Ho first.

491
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,470
If you don't, it will be over for you too.

492
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,000
Chief Han, that bastard. Damn.

493
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,300
- Good evening.
- I'm Officer Jo Eun Ae from the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

494
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,930
Looking at the location, it seems like it's somewhere nearby.

495
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,500
Seriously!

496
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:02,460
Ahjussi. Ahjussi! This is a no smoking area.

497
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,490
It's a public place, and he's being so rude!

498
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,660
Hey, look here.

499
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,600
- Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey!
- What?

500
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,530
- Do you know me?
- I don't.

501
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,640
- What is he doing?
- Forget it. Let's leave.

502
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,340
Why? Ah, why?

503
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,620
He keeps staring at us.

504
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,400
- No, let's go. We're sorry.
- Ah Why?!

505
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,140
Black Net
Stranger

506
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,940
Stranger : Korea University Hospital CCTV.mp4

507
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,610
Korea University Hospital CCTV.mp4

508
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,890
Who is he to tell us what to do? Why did he stare at us?

509
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:54,110
- What was it?
- Excuse me. I'm sorry but let me ask you something.

510
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,850
Have you seen a man who looks like this and who has this tattoo?

511
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:59,810
This ahjussi. You saw him, right?

512
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,250
This barcode, I've seen it at this internet cafe.

513
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,530
The internet cafe?

514
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:07,220
It's our internet cafe. What's the problem?

515
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:13,280
Downloading...

516
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,940
No Signal

517
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,160
What is this?

518
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,850
Portable Light
Security system has been activated.

519
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:15,340
How is it, is it fun? Jang Jae Gyu?

520
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,270
Who is the person who is controlling the murderer Jang Jae Gyu?

521
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,760
Put your phone down.

522
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,150
The person who can save you now is me not him.

523
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,360
Open the door, Jang Jae Gyu.

524
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,280
Don't you have the key?

525
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,650
Open the door, Jang Jae Gyu!

526
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:56,770
I'll leave the files. I'll leave it for you.

527
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,960
Open the door, Jang Jae Gyu!

528
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:08,120
Open the door, Jang Jae Gyu!

529
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,950
It's here. It's here.

530
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:46,110
A person's life is so interesting.

531
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:54,920
It would have been so easy if you had just died.

532
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:02,660
Why are you making both of us exhausted by not dying?

533
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,060
Hurry! Turn the lights on!

534
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,790
This way!

535
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:13,200
Was it you, who hurt our professor?

536
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:29,600
The higher-ups say you should stop now, inspector Yu.

537
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,170
If you keep going on,

538
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:37,780
the person who gets hurt next time may not be you.

539
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:45,730
Probably it will be the hacker Kang Seon Ho for whom you made an exception.

540
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,310
It's probably going to be him.

541
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,910
I'll leave a present for you.

542
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:10,390
Check it when you get up.

543
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,850
Let go, you jerk!

544
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,290
Take this and get lost.

545
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:31,690
Did you think I came here to hold hands with a criminal?

546
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:36,340
Don't mistake me. I came here to catch the guy who controls you.

547
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:45,180
Even if my life ends here, I will catch him and then end my life.

548
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:49,570
So tell me, Jang Jae Gyu. Who is the guy who

549
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,800
not only opened an illegal gambling website but even hurt a person?

550
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,560
Tell me who the b*stard hiding in Police University is, immediately!

551
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:25,740
♫ I guess you're another me. I guess you're like that. ♫

552
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:32,900
♫ The only person who resembles me is you. ♫

553
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:39,870
♫ When you look at me and touch me ♫

554
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:45,790
♫ I feel the reason I open my eyes everyday ♫

555
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:48,170
♫ That reason is you.

556
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,420
♫ Even if someone knocks me down and I collapse

557
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,640
Police University
~Preview~

558
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,760
The culprit is actually one among the professors?

559
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,620
Who the hell is that person? Is it a woman or a man?

560
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,740
It was a mistake he made to get the surgery fee for his father.

561
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,170
They say there is evidence. If we find that alone, we can find the culprit.

562
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:08,300
No. This time we will have to give up.

563
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,780
Have you still not changed your mind?

564
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,700
Can't you take my side for one last time?

565
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,390
Take it.

566
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:17,160
I see this as a reason for expulsion. Let's open the school disciplinary committee hearing.

567
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,950
This isn't training guys. This is the real thing. And Seon Ho is insisting on getting involved!

568
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,530
Kang Seon Ho will open it

569
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:26,460
because he also has something he needs from there.
