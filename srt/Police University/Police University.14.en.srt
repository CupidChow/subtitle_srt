00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,410
Episode 14

2
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,510
Professor Yu Dong Man

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,200
You saw the photo, didn't you?

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,480
You bastard, what are you trying to do right now?

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,400
What do you mean? I'm trying to catch all of you and lock you up.

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,410
Seon Ho hurry!

7
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,580
Zelkova Tree Support Association Day
August 27, 2016

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,440
Anyway, the money that people gamble with on this site is already virtual currency.

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,900
It's the same website.

10
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,140
Gamble Money

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,070
Zelkova Tree Support Association Day

12
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,220
- Yu Dong Man!
- Shut up and listen to me first.

13
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,520
If you mess with my students one more time,

14
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,750
I'll follow you to the depths of hell to catch you.

15
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,450
I ordered the students to do it

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,520
to catch the criminal hiding in the National Police University.

17
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,320
So, instead of the students,

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,490
talk to me from now on.

19
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,610
What, how,

20
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,360
and who are you saying you were trying to catch that you put them (the students) up to it?

21
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,920
Can you take responsibility for what you just said, Professor Yu?

22
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,210
The professors are right.

23
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,790
Shouldn't you explain the situation properly

24
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,340
so that everyone here can understand it?

25
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,070
Professor Yu Dong Man.

26
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,980
We caught the culprit who ran away, Professor.

27
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,870
Culprit?

28
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,240
Yes. Not only did he run an illegal gambling ring,

29
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,450
but he's the culprit who injured Professor Yu Dong Man

30
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,610
and broke into the National Police University.

31
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,680
What are you saying...

32
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,130
Payment Ledger

33
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,610
Mr. Jang, a man in his 30s who was wanted for running an illegal gambling site,

34
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,780
was arrested at the National Police University in Asan on the night of the 7th.

35
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,400
Mr. Jang, who had been avoiding police investigations for more than two months,

36
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,410
was found to have infiltrated the National Police University to steal a gun needed to escape

37
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,520
and was caught by the students passing by the scene.

38
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,380
Yes, yes. I'm sure the press director will block it.

39
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,050
The police will investigate Mr. Jang to see if there is an accomplice who helped him escape,

40
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,670
while the investigation into the illegal gambling sites

41
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,150
that have not been closed yet is expected to accelerate.

42
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,450
An illegal gambling site that has been operating for several years avoiding a police investigation network,

43
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,150
and Mr. Jang was at the center of it.

44
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,930
And the National Police University students who put an end to his escape incident

45
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,850
that had lasted for months.

46
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,460
Punishment Announcement
Persons subject to discipline: Oh Kang Hui, No Beom Tae, Jo Jun Wuk
Disciplinary Decision: Probation

47
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,280
Person subject to discipline: Kang Seon Ho
Disciplinary Decision: Indefinite Suspension

48
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,840
It was this incident where their wit and courage stood out.

49
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,660
I am Im Hyeon Seok of KCS.

50
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,630
Okay! The news is going out!

51
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,400
Okay, what nonsense.

52
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,290
Kill this news story.

53
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,500
Director.

54
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,840
The police contacted me to take care of this quietly

55
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,060
and we've already decided to do that, so bring another story, punk.

56
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,970
If you make things uncomfortable, then your juniors

57
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,490
won't be able to do their reporting.

58
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,580
- But we need to tell the truth—
- Damn it!

59
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,100
If you want to do whatever you want, just go to Youtube

60
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,180
and submit your resignation here.

61
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,970
You and I have to obey orders, what can you do?

62
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,410
Forget it Reporter Im. I'll talk to you later.

63
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,660
Han Jeong Sik must be really

64
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,100
anxious right now.

65
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,550
Zelkova Tree Support Association Day

66
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,440
Why isn't that punk here yet?

67
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,810
What? Are you going to say that you're sorry again?

68
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,490
You've been saying that since last night.

69
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,260
Because of me, you guys are involved in this.

70
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,100
You guys even received disciplinary action.

71
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,660
Of course, we should receive disciplinary action

72
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,000
because it's true that we broke the rules, regardless

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,920
of whether or not we caught the culprit.

74
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,220
And thanks to Professor Yu Dong Man,

75
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,250
everyone was able to avoid expulsion.

76
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,560
We just have to not create any more issues.

77
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,200
Then your suspension will be lifted too.

78
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,350
Right?

79
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,980
Of course.

80
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,740
Now that the ledgers are out, and all the evidence is out too,

81
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,900
the professor will find the culprit soon.

82
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,490
All I have to do is help while by his side until then.

83
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,480
I will never give you cause to worry

84
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,590
about me anymore. I promise.

85
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,900
Now you say what I want to hear.

86
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,460
If you do it again, I will never see you again.

87
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,340
Okay.

88
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,670
I'm serious. So keep that in mind.

89
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,770
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

90
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh, right! The guys couldn't come out because they were cleaning.

91
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,370
Beom Tae and Jun Wuk will hold up well, right?

92
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,990
Hey, they look weak, but they are stronger than you think.

93
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,280
Geez.

94
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,590
I was bad.

95
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,990
To be honest, I thought it was a relief when I heard that Seon Ho

96
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,800
was going to be suspended by himself.

97
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,470
I'm a three-time test taker

98
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,800
and if I get cut from the police force, my life will be over.

99
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,550
I was suddenly nervous

100
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,780
about getting a penalty like that.

101
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,950
I was a bad person...

102
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,080
Only our Seon Ho ended up...

103
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,260
Hey punk, how can that be bad?

104
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,810
Come here.

105
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,340
Don't you know Seon Ho?

106
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,190
He's going to come back to school as if nothing happened.

107
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,020
- Right?
- Yes.

108
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,820
He will, right?

109
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,720
What are you guys doing?

110
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,050
You guys were acting like you were already cops. Serves you right.

111
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,020
But Kang Seon Ho, that jerk, hasn't been expelled yet?

112
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,140
But then again, if he has 150 penalty points,

113
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,360
he'll be expelled from school even if he goes in for an honorary report.

114
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,300
Hey Cha Seong Su!

115
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,020
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

116
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:15,240
- It's an assault during disciplinary action, so you have to report it to the leadership department, Sunbae!
- An assault?

117
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,300
It's an assault. A water assault.

118
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,810
- Sunbae!
- Hey that's enough.

119
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,000
He could have made a mistake while cleaning.

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,070
It wasn't a mistake! No Beom Tae, that punk shot me with water on purpose.

121
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:34,490
Hey, just say it's a mistake. You're embarrassing yourself.

122
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,390
But seriously is this school jinxed or what?

123
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,390
After all these incidents, do we need to perform an exorcism?

124
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,120
You're right.

125
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,130
Go away water demon!

126
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,910
Sunbae!

127
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,100
Damn it.

128
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,880
Are just the two of us investigating again?

129
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
Of course, punk!

130
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,320
Han Jeong Sik's name was all over that ledger.

131
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,230
If we hand that over to the police,

132
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,080
we will be doing Chief Han a favor.

133
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,220
Do you think I'm crazy?

134
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,570
I'm glad I got suspended.

135
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,350
Let's go in.

136
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,110
Why is this so heavy?

137
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,690
- Why are you doing that when you're not well? Give it to me.
- No.

138
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,440
It's fine.

139
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,600
Convenience Store

140
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,720
Nothing was found?

141
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,320
Yes, sir.

142
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,590
There was nothing special when Jang Jae Gyu was arrested.

143
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:09,400
They finished searching his residence but nothing else came out.

144
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,230
I'm busy, so I'll be leaving now.

145
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,750
Wait.

146
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,190
When you guys missed Jang Jae Gyu at the internet cafe,

147
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,750
you said there was an accomplice, right?

148
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,560
Professor, take a look at this.

149
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,970
When the money is handed over to the police,

150
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,120
I think there are two methods of payment, "in-kind" (goods/services only) and "cash."

151
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,670
Han Jeong Sik mostly received in-kind payments, but the amount has increased sharply since two years ago.

152
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,990
And there is someone who received a larger amount than Han Jeong Sik.

153
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,830
Someone named Ju Jae Il. It's the only one that doesn't have any affiliation.

154
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,180
Ju Jae Il

155
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,120
I think we need to look into this person.

156
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,680
These are all the bastards who took bribes.

157
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,680
By what method? Were they all through the sponsorship association?

158
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,240
Yes.

159
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,330
Did you find anything out about the Zelkova Tree Support Association?

160
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,200
Yes. I heard that if the police get caught up in a lawsuit while on duty,

161
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,330
they will pay for the lawsuit, and support the hospital expenses of injured police.

162
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,690
That's probably just nominal.

163
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,860
In the end, it's a paper company set up to deliver the bribes.

164
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,890
And they're all under the names of people without family or friends.

165
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,230
- But why did they create a support association?
- What do you mean?

166
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,720
I just wonder, if the purpose really was for money laundering or to deliver bribes,

167
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,560
was there a reason to establish an association to do that?

168
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,720
A reason? What's so important about that, punk?

169
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,250
That those damn jerks established an illegal gambling ring

170
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,420
and the last culprit hasn't been caught yet is what's important.

171
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,390
That's true, but...

172
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,220
What about the payments in the ledger?

173
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,970
I think they kept changing their account to avoid tracking.

174
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,360
Kim Ik Gu, Seo Min Wu, Lee Ju Wan.

175
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,840
I'm guessing that they created fake bank books.

176
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,280
Wait a moment. Who?

177
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,410
Kim Ik Gu, Seo Min Wu, Lee Ju Wan.

178
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,070
Lee Ju Wan?

179
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,920
Professor Choi Hui Su. I saw her meeting you a few days ago.

180
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,990
She was my junior's wife.

181
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,040
Inspector Lee Ju Won. He was a police officer, didn't you know?

182
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,900
Memorial Service for a police officer who died on duty.
Lee Ju Won rest in peace.

183
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,100
Why? Is that someone you know?

184
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,630
It's Choi Hui Su again.

185
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,090
What?

186
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,160
Where are you going?

187
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,050
I have to see the prime suspect first, right away.

188
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,410
You're going to the school, right?

189
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,060
Yes.

190
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,730
Yes, Beom Tae.

191
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,200
What is this? They didn't even contact me.

192
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,390
Beom Tae, wait a minute.

193
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,530
What are you doing right now?

194
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,270
Hey, arrest Dong Man.

195
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,290
- Team Leader!
- Professor.

196
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,660
Hey. Hey Detective Ju!

197
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,010
Kang Seon Ho, on September 9th at 10:17,

198
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,280
you are under arrest without a warrant for abetting an escape and violating the Information and Communication Act.

199
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,480
You can hire an attorney, you have the right to remain silent,

200
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,340
and you can file an appeal on the legality of the arrest without a warrant.

201
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,510
What the hell are you doing now?

202
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,370
What do you mean?

203
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,060
Tell me properly. What are you saying?

204
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,520
I was on a call with him.

205
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,920
Suddenly they said he was under arrest without a warrant, and Seon Ho...

206
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,630
This is driving me crazy. You distracted the police and let me get away.

207
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,900
Don't you remember?

208
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,000
The police going all the way to Zeto Internet Cafe in Asan

209
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,190
in vain was all because of this bastard.

210
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,290
This bastard hacked into the system and opened the emergency exit for me,

211
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,910
and I ran away from there.

212
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,230
How many times should I say this calmly?

213
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,410
I get it for now so shut your mouth.

214
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,790
Mr. Kang Seon Ho, is the testimony given by

215
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,130
Mr. Jang Jae Gyu just now all true?

216
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,070
Where were you and what were you doing on

217
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,320
Thursday, September 2nd 2021, at around 10:30 pm?

218
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,950
He's using the right to remain silent.

219
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,860
- Yu Dong Man! Get it together!
- Let go of me.

220
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,200
Lose your attitude.

221
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,860
Let's be smart and rational, okay?

222
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,020
All right. All right.

223
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,760
Hey! Don't go there!

224
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,020
I'm telling you I'll take care of it myself.

225
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,540
I also have to live, right?

226
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:21,630
Just stay quiet at school

227
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,830
as you always do.

228
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,060
I told you that I'd chase you to the depths of hell if you messed with my students, right?

229
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,800
This bastard. You really do whatever you feel like.

230
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,930
How dare a mere inspector grab the chief by the collar?

231
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,790
I don't see a chief here.

232
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:02,630
I can only see a criminal who accepted bribes from the culprit behind the illegal gambling ring!

233
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,840
Bribe?

234
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,960
Who said it was a bribe?

235
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,570
I only received a police donation that was made to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

236
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,130
And I don't know how they gathered that money either.

237
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:25,420
Doing this to me when I only fulfilled my duties to promote the public interest is not fair.

238
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,140
This crazy bastard!

239
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:36,430
Yu Dong Man, bring me the ledger if you want to save Kang Seon Ho.

240
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,620
- Hey! Dong Man!
 - You son of a—

241
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,950
Drag him out quickly!

242
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,870
Let go. Let go. Let go!!

243
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,050
Did you just say you are going out?

244
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,730
Yes, please let me.

245
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,100
Student Oh Kang Hui. Do you know you are currently being disciplined?

246
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,520
There is no way you don't know that you are strictly prohibited during this period

247
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,110
from going out and staying out overnight.

248
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,340
I know it well.

249
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,500
I am glad. You may return to work.

250
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,340
I will finish cleaning up after I come back.

251
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,940
I will finish all the cleaning and training for the day.

252
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,980
I will finish them even if it takes all night.

253
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,910
- So please just once more—
- Your punishment started yesterday.

254
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,040
I will absolutely not allow it. I will not grant permission and you know it.

255
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,800
So go back to work immediately.

256
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,010
What are you doing? Are you not listening to me?

257
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,960
Let her go, Administrator.

258
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,530
Professor!

259
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,100
She seems to have somewhere she must go to. We should let her go.

260
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,420
You know they won't stop even if we try to stop them.

261
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,490
Yu Dong Man, bring me the ledger

262
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,170
if you want to save Kang Seon Ho.

263
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,530
Hey, hey, hey, I get it all.

264
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,960
Jang Jae Gyu was adamant that Kang Seon Ho aided his escape.

265
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,720
We had no choice but to arrest him.

266
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,400
A warrant hasn't been issued yet, so don't get worked up. Huh?

267
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,150
I am his guardian.

268
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,940
Let's not notify his father for now.

269
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,980
Fine.

270
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,340
Hey, what's with the look in your eyes?

271
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,300
I will definitely lock up those bastards,

272
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,910
so you just keep the kid until that happens.

273
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,450
That may be safer.

274
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,550
What are you saying now?

275
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,640
Hey, punk, come here! Come here!

276
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,880
Why? What?

277
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,590
Team leader, let me see the kid before I go.

278
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,710
How can you laugh in this situation?

279
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,590
Just because.

280
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,400
It's just like when we met the first time.

281
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,430
Then and now

282
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,620
I haven't changed a bit, Professor.

283
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,710
Punk. Of course, you have.

284
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,400
You are not any nicer, and you are even ruder.

285
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,660
You keep blabbing just because you know more now.

286
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,560
And you refuse to listen to me.

287
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,330
How did you not change? You changed so much, punk.

288
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,600
You just tried to catch bad people who tried to kill someone.

289
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,900
Things went bad in the process.

290
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,100
You don't need to add any reasons or sentiments to that. Understand?

291
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,970
I'll be back.

292
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,420
Order a big size soup and rice and eat it.

293
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,760
Sit up straight and keep your head up.

294
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,410
Okay.

295
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,900
It's him, right? The person in the report you asked me to get for you at the hospital?

296
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:46,670
Yes. I think I have said this to you often, Detective Ju.

297
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,420
Jeez.

298
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,890
What? What are you going to ask me again?

299
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,760
Where's Dong Man?

300
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,220
He made copies for a long time and just left.

301
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,240
He had a crazed look in his eyes.

302
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,230
Just what the heck is going on?

303
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,040
I know right?

304
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,900
Where did it go?

305
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,270
Oh my...

306
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,320
The ink on the new car loan paper hasn't even dried yet. Where are the car keys?

307
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,950
Where did it go?

308
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,060
You friggin bastard!!!

309
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,380
You punk!!!

310
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,500
Where are you?

311
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,330
Come to the school.

312
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,540
I'll be waiting.

313
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:36,780
Professor Gwon, shall we have a cup of coffee?

314
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,280
How are the students doing?

315
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,910
They're anxious. The professor of investigation is not there,

316
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,400
and the criminal was caught, and it's not even the first time.

317
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,660
The kids can't focus on classes now.

318
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:09,390
I know, right? How did it come to this point?

319
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,930
Our kids have done no wrong.

320
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,550
They've gone through too much.

321
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:28,400
They say the ground hardens after the rain. Even so,

322
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,650
would you please look out for the kids

323
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,840
so they won't shake too much in the storm?

324
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,490
Me?

325
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,120
Yes.

326
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,380
I think you are the right person.

327
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,710
Come in. Sit there.

328
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,560
By chance, did you notify the school, too?

329
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,340
No, not yet. A warrant hasn't been issued.

330
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,800
Now there are just the two of us so I'll speak casually.

331
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,050
Chief Han Jeong Sik is the mastermind.

332
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,820
I heard from Sunbae.

333
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,400
He said he was going to the school and gave me this.

334
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,300
He said you'll know what to do with it.

335
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,550
Payment Ledger

336
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,260
Ju Jae Il.

337
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,390
Please let me borrow a laptop, Detective.

338
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,840
Are you feeling alright?

339
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,670
Zelkova Tree Support Association Day, August 27, 2016.

340
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,890
Did you do it?

341
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:44,650
Choi Hui Su. Are you the culprit?

342
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,150
If I say no, will you believe me?

343
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,880
Just answer me.

344
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,450
I guess you won't believe me.

345
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,020
From the illegal gambling ring ledger,

346
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,670
there was proof that your husband Lee Ju Won was a member.

347
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:10,590
There was also proof that he delivered a bribe to Han Jeong Sik as a sponsor.

348
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,150
Going so far as to lie while meeting Han Jeong Sik and Go Deok Bae,

349
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:21,400
being at this school from 2006 when the illegal gambling ring was formed,

350
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,140
it's all you, Choi Hui Su.

351
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,420
Isn't that all circumstantial?

352
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:38,880
I think you're done talking. Now listen to me.

353
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,740
I don't know if you know but Zelkova Tree Support Association is a group that helps the police.

354
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,350
What?

355
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,670
They help current police officers

356
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:54,930
and also sponsor funeral expenses for bereaved families, and they even sponsor consolation settlement funds.

357
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,000
Although, it was all earned through an illegal gambling ring.

358
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,130
If you're going to confess do it down at the station.

359
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,360
Shut your mouth and listen closely to what I have to say first.

360
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,660
The question isn't why the illegal gambling ring established Zelkova Tree Support Association

361
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,490
but why the Zelkova Tree Support Association even went so far as to make an illegal gambling ring.

362
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,400
Don't look at the trees but the forest.

363
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,930
If you chase that, the culprit will be standing in front of you.

364
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,360
That could be me like you think

365
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,850
or it could be someone else.

366
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,700
What are you trying to do right now?

367
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,520
I've finished saying what I wanted to.

368
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,180
Whether my words are a confession or a testimony, it's now time for you to find out.

369
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,280
I'll wait here.

370
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,590
Hey, hey Choi Hui Su!

371
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,410
Yes, speak.

372
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,740
Seon Ho found out what Ju Jae Il is.

373
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,450
Ju Jae Il?

374
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,760
Yes, it's the place where the largest amount of money went.

375
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,030
And there's someone who is receiving a larger amount than Han Jeong Sik.

376
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:35,450
It's a person called Ju Jae Il but it's the only one without an affiliation.

377
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,700
I'll send you the address now.

378
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,860
Confirm it. Yes.

379
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,220
- Detective.
- Yes?

380
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,710
Someone is looking for you.

381
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,420
Who?

382
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,110
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

383
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,560
Seon Ho's friend?

384
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,250
Yes.

385
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,540
I'm sorry to say, but you can't meet him because he's being investigated.

386
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,790
Then could I make one phone call to Seon Ho?

387
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,310
Please.

388
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,170
Not long, keep it short. And I have to listen in on it.

389
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,040
Thank you.

390
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,390
Kang Hui.

391
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,290
How could this happen?

392
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,310
You promised not to make any more mistakes,

393
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,520
and that this wouldn't happen.

394
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,030
It's only been one day since you said that to me.

395
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,990
Do you even consider me in your decision-making?

396
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,080
Kang Hui, I'll explain everything.

397
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,960
It's gotten a little complicated because of the ledger that came out of that safe.

398
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,730
The school hasn't heard yet—
- Kang Seon Ho.

399
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,730
You... While I was coming here

400
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,300
do you know how I was feeling?

401
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,230
I was like a crazy woman.

402
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,980
It's going to be okay. There won't be anything wrong.

403
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,650
Feeling that way,

404
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,090
I worried that something terrible happened to you.

405
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,140
My heart would fall in an instant,

406
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,060
I felt crazed worrying about the traffic,

407
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,950
my emotions were a tangled crazy mess.

408
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,810
At the same time,

409
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,250
I started feeling angry with you.

410
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,900
Thinking about it,

411
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,550
I had felt like this many times,

412
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,420
every time my mother was taken away by the police.

413
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,840
And now, even my boyfriend...

414
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,520
I guess the words, "I've done enough,"

415
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,360
are used at times like these.

416
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,660
H-Hold on, Kang Hui.

417
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,820
Let's stop here.

418
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,330
♫ I will remember. ♫

419
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,600
Let's break up.

420
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,200
Kang Hui.

421
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,590
♫ and the time now that I can't remember  ♫

422
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:54,560
♫ I can remember ♫

423
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,250
♫ From behind me getting farther away whether I keep reaching for you or not ♫

424
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,780
♫ Warmly so you won't get sick ♫

425
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,050
♫ I won't see it ♫

426
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:14,130
♫ Will you remember even if time passes? ♫

427
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:20,920
♫ Both now and then I will be there for you ♫

428
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:33,420
♫ I was thankful even for the difficult moments.
 ♫

429
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,510
How can there be no evidence?

430
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,550
- That is—
- Then why did you arrest him without a warrant?

431
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,820
- But Chief, you were—
- Go and find the evidence immediately!

432
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,880
If there isn't any, make it up and bring it! I don't care what you do!

433
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,380
Hold onto Kang Seon Ho. Got it?!

434
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,700
Sunbae gave this to me and said...

435
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:21,110
If I am late, or you think something's gone wrong,

436
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,430
give this to Director Han Jeong Sik.

437
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,280
Payment Ledger

438
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,620
Director Han Jeong Sik?

439
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:37,580
Give that to him and ask him to let Seon Ho go without getting hurt.

440
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,360
If you need to get out, make your decision.

441
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,860
Jaeil Corporation

442
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,150
Ju Jae Il isn't a person. It's a factory.

443
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,390
Jaeil Corporation

444
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,120
Then go home safely.

445
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,740
How may I help you?

446
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,320
Zelkova Tree Support Association?

447
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,530
Do you know it?

448
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:51,090
I don't know about it but the person who handles that is our company manager.

449
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,260
Today he is working overtime so he'll probably be here after thirty minutes.

450
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,940
I'll wait. Well. What do you make here?

451
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:08,260
We make stuff like bulletproof vests, protective gloves, protective gear.

452
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,790
Payment Ledger

453
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:24,490
Yes, Eun Ju died while

454
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:27,870
chasing the guys behind the illegal gambling ring.

455
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,310
If only I hadn't hacked the website

456
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,960
you could have caught all those guys behind the illegal gambling ring.

457
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,960
Whether you hacked or not, it's my fault that I let go of the culprit.

458
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,350
The ledger ...

459
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,200
Don't give it to them.

460
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:58,950
If you give that to them, the professor can't complete this investigation.

461
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,360
What are you doing with the suspect?

462
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,770
T- Team Leader.

463
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,540
No matter what the situation, what were you doing with a suspect who is under investigation?

464
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,940
But, Team Leader... the day Jang Jae Gyu gave his testimony,

465
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,220
there wasn't any CCTV in the vicinity that he was captured on.

466
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,540
You clearly know a warrant will be denied.

467
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,130
Shut up.

468
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,020
Do you guys want to lose your jobs?

469
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,460
Let's put him in the detention center. Get out right now and

470
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,190
find evidence on Kang Seon Ho.

471
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,890
Of course, I know.

472
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,250
Through the Zelkova Tree Support Association, our products are distributed to police stations.

473
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,960
Among the police officer's protective equipment, some are old or in short supply.

474
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,040
I understand they somehow find out quickly about those items

475
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,260
and get them sent away as donations.

476
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,610
When it comes to protective gear, we are very familiar with it.

477
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,050
How long has it been?

478
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:28,950
I think it's already about five to six years.

479
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:34,230
Could I possibly get a list of what has been delivered during that time period?

480
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,490
Yes, wait a moment.

481
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:58,460
2021/1/04 - Zelkova Tree Support Association - protective gloves- 200 - 20,000 -4,000,000

482
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,800
Gyeonggi Nambu Office.

483
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,470
How is this...

484
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,810
Delivery date: 2021/01/05 Account name: Zelkova Sponsor Association
Wrist protector (WG2001) / 500 / 10,000 / 5,00

485
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,680
The Zelkova Tree Support Association is a group that helps the police.

486
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,710
But if the purpose is to launder money or deliver bribes,

487
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,210
why the need to establish a support association?

488
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:49,620
The question isn't why the illegal gambling ring established Zelkova Tree Support Association

489
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,370
but why the Zelkova Tree Support Association even went so far as to make an illegal gambling ring.

490
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,450
Don't look at the trees but the forest.

491
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:04,350
If you chase that, the culprit would be right in front of you.

492
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,830
Zelkova Tree Support Association Day

493
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,840
The number you are calling does not exist ...

494
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,380
What's wrong with you?

495
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,180
The phone number you gave me doesn't exist now.

496
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,260
The burner phone.

497
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,990
Whatever I told you earlier is everything I know.

498
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,080
What about this picture?

499
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,660
I went there just once because I was invited.

500
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,890
I saw all these people there for the first time.

501
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,760
Honestly, I don't even remember well because I only went there for business.

502
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,220
And that phone number also belongs to someone whom you don't know?

503
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,500
Hey! Does that even make sense?

504
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,830
It was one of the conditions of the contract with Zelkova Tree Support Association.

505
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,040
If someone came to the factory and asked questions about their sponsorship,

506
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,680
we had to call this number. If we didn't, the contract would become null and void.

507
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:57,250
But, last time I was able to call.

508
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,960
Why does it say that the number doesn't exist this time?

509
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,840
You called last time?

510
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,980
Yes. It was about two years ago, I guess.

511
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,810
A police officer came and asked about the sponsorship.

512
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,510
Who was it?

513
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,370
That was...

514
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,180
I don't remember the name.

515
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,630
He had double eyelids, he was tall and

516
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:28,420
he seemed to be in his fifties.

517
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,730
Han Jeong Sik usually received in-kind, but since two years ago, the amount increased.

518
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,760
Han Jeong Sik!

519
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,840
Do you even consider me in your decision-making?

520
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,540
Let's break up.

521
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,350
A fax came in.

522
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:20,170
What is this?

523
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,810
Yes, Dong Man.

524
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,500
Huh?

525
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,800
What?

526
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,230
Hey, kid!

527
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:07,710
Get in. Let's go.

528
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:29,220
I clearly told you no matter how you did it to hang on to Kang Seon Ho.

529
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,550
Let's just say this was a trade.

530
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,850
Payment Ledger

531
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,020
Where are we going?

532
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,910
There's something we have to confirm for the last time.

533
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,350
Notice

534
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,980
Kang Hui, did you hear that?

535
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,880
Professor Seo Sang Hak lifted the suspension.

536
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,990
Seon Ho can come back to school from tomorrow.

537
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:40,180
He also came out of the police station today morning without any problem.

538
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,500
Thank god he got released right?

539
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,910
Right, Kang Hui?

540
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,500
I broke up with Seon Ho.

541
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,290
What?

542
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,570
So don't talk about Seon Ho in front of me.

543
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,350
Why are you cleaning?

544
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:37,620
Yes.

545
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,250
It has to be empty so you fill it up with the new.

546
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,470
What is this, Professor?

547
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,480
Ah, it's trash.

548
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,090
- Shall I throw it away?
- No, no.

549
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,420
I made it so it's only right for me to throw it out.

550
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:05,810
When I'm about to forget, you come.

551
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:09,760
I'm also tired of seeing your face.

552
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,500
Take it out.

553
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,540
Zelkova Tree Support Association

554
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,540
The Zelkova Tree Support Association.

555
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,700
It looks like you guys played a lot of tricks using it.

556
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,460
What?

557
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,420
While pretending to support the police

558
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:40,890
you handed over the money to the corrupt police and did all kinds of things.

559
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:44,670
Everything was there on the ledger. Right?

560
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,810
Well, it takes one to know one.

561
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:59,510
I just know very well what trash like you do.

562
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,110
Hey, Inspector Yu.

563
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,230
Do you know why Park Cheol Jin almost died?

564
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,290
He kept getting confused.

565
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:18,250
He didn't even know what was important.

566
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,140
The ones that you are after, from the gambling site,

567
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,710
they're at the National Police University–

568
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,490
Cheol Jin. Cheol Jin.

569
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,770
Park Cheol Jin!

570
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:30,680
Cheol Jin!

571
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:47,270
Why did you make things complicated?

572
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:51,560
We did all that to save police like you.

573
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:00,170
We all started at first with the same intention—to do something good.

574
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:03,640
Sometimes you end up getting your hands covered in dirt or blood,

575
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,860
but that bastard kept making a big deal all of a sudden.

576
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,920
Hey, Go Deok Bae!

577
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,910
We established the illegal gambling ring to help you police.

578
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:18,850
We protected your frivolous justice with the money we earned there!

579
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,550
Who?

580
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,670
Professor Seo Sang Hak?

581
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:42,500
Let me ask you just one thing for the last time.

582
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,530
The woman who you called...

583
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,750
Wo—Woman?

584
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:51,430
No. That person was a man.

585
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:29,150
Did he go to a class?

586
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:40,010
Zelkova Tree Support Association

587
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,660
Visiting Room

588
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,040
Let's go, Professor.

589
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:11,850
Yes, let's go.

590
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,490
Introduction to Public Administration

591
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:29,450
Every year students come and ask me this question without fail.

592
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:35,540
If you think you can understand the criminal's motive,

593
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,500
and in the same situation,

594
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,660
would I have been able to not commit a crime?

595
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:47,250
What should I do when I

596
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,760
get this doubt about myself,

597
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:58,020
whether or not people who feel that have the right to be police.

598
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:05,360
My answer was always the same.

599
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,100
It's normal.

600
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:13,640
You do have the right by just thinking that.

601
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:21,160
But, this year I somehow want to give a different answer.

602
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:28,000
Never give justification to anyone who breaks the law.

603
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,970
Whether that is your friend or lover or family

604
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,810
or teacher.

605
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,170
You don't have to understand them.

606
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:47,540
Regardless of the reason,

607
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,420
if they have committed a crime, you should help them to reflect upon themselves

608
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,720
and get their punishment.

609
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,330
It is very difficult, Professor.

610
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:04,450
Yes, it is. It won't be easy.

611
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:17,540
But it is something you shouldn't avoid just because it is difficult.

612
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:25,290
Because you are the future police.

613
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:28,730
You are people who will uphold justice.

614
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:35,490
So, don't get hurt.

615
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,860
Don't die.

616
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:44,520
That is how you can do everything.

617
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:02,910
I apologize. I think the story suddenly went off tangent.

618
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,120
For some reason today's class seems short.

619
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,100
You all worked hard.

620
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,540
Thank you, sir.

621
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,420
Thank you, sir.

622
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,530
Professor Seo Sang Hak

623
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:09,000
Yes. This is Seo Sang Hak.

624
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:39,600
♫  I guess you're another me. I guess you're like that. ♫

625
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:46,610
♫ You are the one person who resembles me ♫

626
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:53,620
♫ When you look at me when you always touch me ♫

627
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:59,300
♫  feel the reason I open my eyes every day ♫

628
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,870
♫ the reason is indeed you. ♫

629
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:13,530
Police University
~ Preview ~

630
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:16,370
One person died and one person got hurt.

631
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:20,070
If they have such a story behind it, anyone would do such a shitty thing.

632
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:24,920
If you got those noble hands dirty, then you should just go all the way to the end.

633
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,270
What can I do so that no one gets hurt?

634
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:30,910
After seeing the professor for the last time ...

635
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:34,600
I don't have the right to be beside you now.

636
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,370
Meet me in front of the gate tomorrow at eleven o clock.

637
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:40,440
What exactly has Seon Ho been doing?

638
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,840
I was grateful that you let me go to this school.

639
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,900
♫ I guess you're another me.  ♫
