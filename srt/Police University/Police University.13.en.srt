00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:09,580
Episode 13

2
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,510
It really is tenacious...

3
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,430
human life.

4
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,850
If you had just died,

5
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,290
it would have been easier.

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,600
Why make things more difficult for both of us by not dying?

7
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,870
The higher-ups want you, Inspector Yu,

8
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,910
to stop already.

9
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,550
If you continue, the next person who'll get hurt

10
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,690
may not be you.

11
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,780
The one who you let off the hook,

12
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,470
hacker Kang Seon Ho.

13
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,370
It'll probably be him, no?

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,150
Decide carefully.

15
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,140
Don't make me hurt the kid, too.

16
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,250
You can't let him end up like Park Cheol Jin, can you?

17
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,760
Don't you agree?

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,010
I will leave a present for you.

19
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,930
Check it when you wake up.

20
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,910
Suspect's report

21
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,010
What... what exactly is this?

22
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,400
So tell me Jang Jae Gyu.

23
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,650
As if running an illegal gambling site is not enough

24
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,900
that bastard even tried to kill people.

25
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,940
Give me the name of the bastard who's hiding in the police academy!!

26
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,410
If I tell you, do you think you can catch him?

27
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,050
You can't catch that bastard anyway. Why?

28
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,290
There is no evidence.

29
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,590
Then I ought to lock you up first.

30
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,620
You bastard!

31
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,910
Go and search that side.

32
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,590
There is a safe at the National Police University where Go Deok Bae and the Head exchanged goods.

33
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,000
There will be illegal gambling ledgers there too.

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,500
- A ledger?
- Kang Seon Ho. Look for it.

35
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,260
I will give you the key.

36
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,950
You keep the ledger that's in there,

37
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,110
- and I keep the money.
- Don't play me!

38
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,630
You need to catch that bastard quickly anyway

39
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,010
before Yu Dong Man gets hurt more.

40
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,750
But I am curious.

41
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,340
What choice you'll make.

42
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,620
Why are...

43
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,260
Seon Ho and your names on this?

44
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,640
What does "the higher-ups want you to stop" mean?

45
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,250
And what does it mean that Seon Ho will get hurt next?

46
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,680
Professor!

47
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,960
He was trying to make money for his father's surgery.

48
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,190
It was a childish mistake.

49
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,740
That's why I taught him a lesson and closed the case.

50
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,360
Seon Ho.

51
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,650
Where is he now?

52
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,260
Let's go this way.

53
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Tell me.

54
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,060
You just woke up.

55
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,700
- I will tell you when you get a little better.
- Tell me because I'm not dying.

56
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,950
Jang Jae Gyu threatened me through the Blacknet

57
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,870
so I tracked him.

58
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,140
I found out where he was by hacking.

59
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,020
I was going to tell you,

60
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,210
but you got into an accident.

61
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,460
I felt I need to catch him right away,

62
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,070
so I anonymously reported Jang Jae Gyu's location to Detective Ju.

63
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,090
I am sorry.

64
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,460
What did Jang Jae Gyu threaten you with?

65
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,490
Your police report?

66
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:06,400
You were going to catch him to get rid of it?

67
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,620
You went so far as to do illegal hacking

68
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,840
just to destroy your report, punk?

69
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,550
No.

70
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,200
I was going to catch Jang Jae Gyu and

71
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,710
find the culprit hiding in the police academy.

72
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,450
- What?
- The names written on your notes

73
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,760
Seo Sang Hak, Kwan Hyeok Pil, Choi Hui Su, out of the three

74
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,260
I went to find the real culprit who ran the gambling site.

75
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,760
He said there is a safe at the National Police University where Go Deok Bae and the Head exchanged goods.

76
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,050
And there are illegal gambling ledgers in there too.

77
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,490
Professor, if we find those ...

78
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,080
We can catch the real culprit, too.

79
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,690
Who told you that now?

80
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,990
Jang Jae Gyu, that bastard?

81
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,650
Are you out of your mind?

82
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,520
- You believe a criminal's words—
- I know.

83
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,800
If they dragged me in, who has a hacking record and something goes wrong,

84
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,450
they probably thought it would be easy to ditch me.

85
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,960
But you can't avoid it just because you try to.

86
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,440
And nothing will change by not doing anything.

87
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,640
You must keep pressing on to face whatever it is.

88
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,650
- You told me that.
- Hey!

89
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,090
Even if you try to stop me,

90
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,900
I am going to do it.

91
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,570
You only got hurt this time.

92
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,920
But you don't know about next time.

93
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,410
Before something else happens,

94
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,150
I want to catch that bastard.

95
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,140
Seon Ho.

96
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,560
I am sorry...

97
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,010
about everything.

98
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,410
Seon Ho. Hey, Kang Seon Ho!

99
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,030
- You guys...
- No, you can't go.

100
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,910
- Kang Hui.
- Listen to the professor.

101
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,300
Or at least listen to me.

102
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,850
Are you a cop already?

103
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,530
Don't misunderstand. You are still a student.

104
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,190
You've crossed the line...

105
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,550
plenty of times already.

106
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,690
So stop it now.

107
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,040
The culprit is among the professors?

108
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,200
It is true, right? Everything is true, right?

109
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,640
Do it.

110
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,660
- Do it, Seon Ho.
- What?

111
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,260
In return, we'll join you.

112
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,950
Seon Ho, let's do it together.

113
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,020
Who do you think we are?

114
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,640
Professor Yu Dong Man, with 20 years of experience, got hurt!

115
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,350
He got lucky, but he could have died!

116
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,060
This isn't training guys. This is the real thing.

117
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,160
And Seon Ho is insisting on getting involved!

118
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,170
If it is that dangerous then we need to go with him.

119
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,610
Then it makes it less dangerous.

120
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,080
Remember what the professor said?

121
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,850
It will work out if we don't give up.

122
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,420
No. This time we will have to give up.

123
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,020
I am going to stop you guys and make sure you can't do anything.

124
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,450
Go ahead and try.

125
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,220
What? Really?

126
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,050
I am glad Professor Yu is awake.

127
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,080
Yes, thank you.

128
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,680
Professor Yu is recovering.

129
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,220
Who wants to come along to visit him today?

130
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,960
I will go next time. I have classes today.

131
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,920
What about you, Professor Gwon?

132
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,090
I also have something to check out before I see Professor Yu.

133
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,560
Regarding the issue of strengthening the student life standards, I have something to discuss with you urgently.

134
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,590
Strengthening?

135
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,300
No way! Seriously?

136
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,580
Yes, I heard they left without permission and got caught drinking.

137
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,750
They're so unlucky. How did they get caught?

138
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,150
They got drunk and went looking for girls, but that turned out to be

139
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,180
the guidance counselor.

140
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,130
What?!!!

141
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,690
- For real?
- Daebak.

142
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,900
I got goosebumps.

143
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,010
It's a simple math problem.

144
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,660
At a minimum, way past 2 in the morning,

145
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,360
students in disguise left unauthorized.

146
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,250
They went straight to a pub.

147
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,830
They wildly enjoyed drinking and dancing.

148
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,490
Now, then how many penalty points will that be?

149
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,210
- About 35...
- About 30...

150
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,520
60! 60!! The total penalty is

151
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,660
60!!!

152
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,110
Guidance Counselor, please relax.

153
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,440
I am plenty relaxed!!!

154
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,750
What's the duty of the student president?

155
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,690
Maintaining student discipline, and leads and controls the school life of—

156
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,440
That's right. That's the duty of the student president.

157
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,720
- Head of Operations.
- Yes, ma'am.

158
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,700
Head of Education! What the hell are you doing not taking care of things?

159
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,770
- I am sorry.
- I am sorry.

160
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,560
From this moment on, we will strengthen the rules of student life.

161
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,420
Of course, Professor Seo Sang Hak has also agreed.

162
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,010
From now on, if the penalty points exceed 30 points,

163
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,990
the disciplinary committee will be meet as soon as it exceeds 60 points,

164
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,660
and disciplinary action will be taken after

165
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,590
clear deliberation and resolution. Do you understand?

166
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,960
Yes, understood.

167
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,320
- Do you understand?!
- Yes!

168
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,050
- Get out.
- Yes.

169
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,460
You get out, too.

170
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,680
National Police University Disciplinary Rules

171
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,560
After the change: Penalty Points (30-100points)

172
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,270
As you can see, as of today, leaving without permission after roll call time,

173
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,060
they will receive probation regardless of the reason.

174
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,840
The student council will take turns on night patrols after roll call.

175
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,050
Regardless of their age, whether they're older or younger than you, you will give penalty points right away. Do you understand?

176
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,990
- Yes.
- Yes.

177
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,830
The student council is going to be criticized again.

178
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,200
"Do you understand?!"

179
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,710
I'm going to supervise thoroughly. Hey, you with the slippers!

180
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,400
I'm going to kill them all.

181
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,650
- Seon Ho.
- Huh?

182
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,230
Kang Hui is in the dorm, she's still very angry.

183
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,880
Did you hear about the stricter rules?

184
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,030
Why now of all times?

185
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,560
Exactly. We'll be fine, right?

186
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,440
Well, we're going to try anyway. Right, bro?

187
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,620
Right, Seon Ho. What should we do first?

188
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,740
Before that, let's talk for a moment.

189
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,630
So, Professor Yu Dong Man was the detective

190
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,290
in charge of the case where you were the culprit?

191
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:03,150
No matter the circumstances, I shouldn't have committed a crime.

192
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,710
I chose the easiest way.

193
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,580
I'm sorry for letting you hear such things.

194
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,820
It would have been nice if we were friends back then.

195
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,610
Then I would have lent you money immediately.

196
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,490
But you guys are with me now, right?

197
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,160
Anyway, I'm saying that I can't do anything even if I get kicked out of school like this.

198
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,720
I have nothing to lose anymore,

199
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,990
so I'm okay.

200
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,090
You guys don't have to do this with me.

201
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,090
Let me do this alone. It's something I should handle on my own.

202
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,140
Hey! Kang Seon Ho.

203
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,820
It may be a problem that started because of your mistake a year ago. But it's not so now.

204
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,210
Yes. It's not because of you.

205
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:19,710
We are also trying to catch those evil people who are lying in front of the other students and talking about justice.

206
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,920
And honestly, that person could be someone

207
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,120
among the professors, but maybe not.

208
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,920
Right. Honestly, there's a part of me that's hoping to confirm that it's not the case.

209
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,490
Let's not talk about this problem again.

210
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,420
The decision was already made that night.

211
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,250
Got it, fool?

212
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,360
Yes, got it?

213
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,810
I get it, but why did you raise your voice?

214
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,490
Hey, how was it? I was so cool just now, right?

215
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,450
So cool. Cool.

216
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,630
So, what do we start with?

217
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,790
Yes, you must have a plan, right?

218
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,460
Just say the word.

219
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,620
I was so cool. Really cool, right?

220
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,370
If you continue, the next person who'll get hurt may not be you.

221
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:36,460
The one who you let off the hook, hacker Kang Seon Ho.

222
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,830
It'll probably be him, no?

223
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,630
Why is she being so savage again?

224
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,650
So, what time are you coming?

225
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,320
Why aren't you answering?

226
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,310
Oh, Mom. What did you say?

227
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,400
You said you'd visit me this week.

228
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,570
You told me to behave and watch how I speak because you are coming with a friend.

229
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,160
You made such a fuss.

230
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,920
The thing is, I don't think I can come this week.

231
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,680
Why? Did you already break up?

232
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,560
Or did that guy say that he doesn't want to date you because your mom is in jail?

233
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,740
I said I was going to come with a friend. What nonsense are you saying?

234
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,060
A friend, my foot, bitch.

235
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,690
From the looks of it, he looks like nothing special. Just kick him!

236
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,570
What do you mean from the looks of him when you haven't even seen him?

237
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,870
If you're my age, you can see even if you don't see it.

238
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,330
I told you not to call me bitch.

239
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,270
Why do you swear every time you open your mouth? I'm not asking you for a big favor.

240
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,990
Just don't swear. That's all I want.

241
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,570
Why are you ranting at me, you bitch?

242
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,880
You think I am the easiest person in this world, right?

243
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,050
Bitch. Hang up!

244
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,730
Kang Hui.

245
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,300
Is something going on?

246
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,580
You didn't even eat breakfast and just now

247
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,110
you seemed like you were fighting over the phone.

248
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,080
Are you watching me all day?

249
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't want to do that either,

250
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,930
but I start worrying now that I see your face again.

251
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,580
Why? What happened?

252
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,670
Min Gyu.

253
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,170
Let's talk later. The afternoon class is judo, right?

254
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,810
Yes.

255
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,530
You're lucky that your car is strong.

256
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,830
If not, you would have died. Do you know that, punk?

257
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,290
It would have been better if I had just died.

258
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,330
Let's go. This guy is back to normal.

259
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,010
Ah, the doctor was asking for the guardian.

260
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,760
- Really?
- Yes.

261
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,050
I'll be right back.

262
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,880
Okay.

263
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,820
He went. Tell me.

264
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,780
What?

265
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,500
Team Leader left so tell me quickly.

266
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,570
Oh, okay. The thing is, I accessed Kick's,

267
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,970
but the October 22, 2020, record you mentioned,

268
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,300
it wasn't there in the server.

269
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,280
Really?

270
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,430
If it's not on the server, then I don't think it was uploaded while it was being written.

271
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,050
Cheol Jin must have done that.

272
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,440
What?

273
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,660
Then,

274
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,320
if it wasn't left on the server, it won't be a problem later...

275
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,240
Well, if it ended while the investigation wasn't over,

276
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,440
even if we get the report, there won't be any legal evidence.

277
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,330
But you know, since the charges remain,

278
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,030
if you somehow catch them and summon them again,

279
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,440
the problem gets more complicated.

280
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,450
Your step is also important, but the most important thing is

281
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,600
that you don't pull with your arms, but you use your weight.

282
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,530
All right.

283
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,350
The usual uplift and the two-armed up jaw I just showed you.

284
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,150
Did you all understand how they are different?

285
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,570
Yes.

286
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:28,630
All right. Min Gyu, return to your place. Then let's have one last free match and finish up.

287
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,500
Gender doesn't matter. Everyone, stand in pairs.

288
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,590
You shouldn't go easy on each other because your gender is different.

289
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,350
With civility. Okay?

290
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,880
Yes.

291
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,710
Have you still not changed your mind?

292
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,610
I know you are holding it in.

293
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,340
- I know but—
- Just answer my question.

294
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,420
I'll ask you for the last time. Will you really not change your mind?

295
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,470
Can't you take my side for one last time?

296
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,850
That means you won't change your mind.

297
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,830
I'm sorry.

298
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:52,590
♫ where there was no dream and am looking at the same place ♫

299
00:26:52,590 --> 00:27:03,060
♫ Whenever someone asks who's in my heart? ♫

300
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,130
Don't apologize.

301
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,020
Because I think I'm the one

302
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,080
who's going to be sorry to you hereafter.

303
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:21,260
♫ In the night, wanting to see you, speaking to myself, ♫

304
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:28,210
♫ I love you so much, more than myself, ♫

305
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,020
Let's talk for a moment.

306
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,660
It's a lovers' quarrel.

307
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,730
I am sorry for not telling you. I was wrong.

308
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,520
I wanted to tell you many times.

309
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,050
No, I wanted to open up many times.

310
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,460
But I couldn't...

311
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,070
because I thought you might dislike me.

312
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,340
Because I wanted to believe that if I

313
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,710
didn't tell you it would be as if it never happened.

314
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,180
But when I saw the report, I realized

315
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,360
the mistake I made, the crime I committed.

316
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,460
Not anyone else, but I...

317
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,780
I have to deal with it.

318
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,430
That is why I want to catch the culprit myself, Kang Hui. So—

319
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,410
That's why I'm asking you not to do it.

320
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,690
Because I know you will go in blindly

321
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:59,030
to fight without thinking about what can happen.

322
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:07,820
Professor said that what you did when you were young was a mistake.

323
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,320
Okay, then it was a mistake.

324
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,480
But, if you keep going, it's no longer a mistake.

325
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,990
You really have to take responsibility for everything.

326
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,480
You may have to forget your dream of becoming a police officer,

327
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,380
and you may not be able to attend this school anymore.

328
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,710
Did you consider all of that?

329
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,450
Did you?

330
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:56,920
♫ The person who calls me, comes to me and hugs me ♫

331
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:04,300
♫ Your name is another me ♫

332
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:10,760
♫ When I wander on an endless path and you see me going astray ♫

333
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:18,520
♫ You walk beside me without saying anything ♫

334
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:24,960
♫ With a sunshine like heart which shines after it rains ♫

335
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,990
♫ Your name which loves me more than I love myself ♫

336
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,920
Then you need the luck...

337
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,360
more than me right now.

338
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,850
♫ You are the one person who resembles me ♫

339
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,360
Take it.

340
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:53,350
♫ When you look at me when you always touch me ♫

341
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,990
♫ I feel the reason I open my eyes every day ♫

342
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,690
♫ the reason is indeed you. ♫

343
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:07,500
♫ Even if someone pushes me down and I faint ♫

344
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:14,890
♫ You will wake me up again ♫

345
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:25,760
♫ Not just for a moment in the long life you'll make me live ♫

346
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,590
Kang Seon Ho

347
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,830
You can't let him turn out like Park Cheol Jin.

348
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,700
Don't you think so?

349
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,050
Hyungnim.

350
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,830
How can you not be in your room after telling me to come over?

351
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,440
Do you feel any better?

352
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,340
What's that?

353
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,480
You told me to be a reporter and not a trash reporter.

354
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,670
I worked for one month without sleeping or showering to find this valuable data.

355
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,840
You're saying these are the account details of the illegal gambling, right?

356
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,210
Yes. But, what the police think is weird is

357
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,720
that 80% of the profits are being withdrawn regularly.

358
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,830
I mean, if you withdraw money like this, wouldn't you either buy gold or put it in a safe?

359
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:47,130
Or it means they used that money somewhere. Where did they use all that money?

360
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,290
They must have bribed someone to avoide getting caught.

361
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,150
A bribe?

362
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,520
You need to tail someone.

363
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,370
One hundred, ten million, one hundred.

364
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,350
What in the world is this?

365
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,800
Seems like he doesn't have insurance either.

366
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,060
That punk, Dong Man, has a lot of debt.

367
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,050
I'm sure he doesn't have much money.

368
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,240
Shall we apply for fundraising on the National Police Agency homepage?

369
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,290
Or a sponsorship?

370
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,200
Sponsorship?

371
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,670
That...!

372
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,630
Just because he's higher ranking ...

373
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,330
Just stay there, I'll go to you.

374
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,150
You couldn't even handle just a kid.

375
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,410
He wasn't just a kid.

376
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,530
So?

377
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,850
What are you going to do now?

378
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,290
Kang Seon Ho will open it.

379
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,170
- What?
- He will find the locker and open it

380
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,110
because there is something he needs in there too.

381
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,310
You have to take care of this issue properly.

382
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:50,580
If any document with my name remains,

383
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,830
you will die too.

384
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,530
Chief Han, we're making a deal with each other,

385
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,950
so is it okay for you to treat me so carelessly?

386
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,170
But, let me ask you one thing.

387
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,710
Who is that person?

388
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,430
It's one of the professors at Police University. Is it a woman or a man?

389
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,920
Someone like you doesn't need to know.

390
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,440
Just do your job.

391
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,830
Oh! Geez.

392
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:29,210
I guess you're really anxious.

393
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,920
Don't worry. I will get the data and get out.

394
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,610
I have made plans already.

395
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,860
Just make sure you have everything ready for my getaway.

396
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,480
When I'm done, I'm going to leave Korea.

397
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,760
If you go out now, I'll report you.

398
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,320
After roll call, it's 30 penalty points for going out without permission.

399
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,560
You know you'll be on probation, right?

400
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,000
Aren't you even sorry to Kang Hui for doing as you please?

401
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,460
Korean National Police University

402
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,610
Jun Wuk.

403
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,490
Let's go.

404
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,410
Kim Gu Library

405
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,580
- Hey.
- Let's go in.

406
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,090
This is one of them.

407
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,670
Then...

408
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,830
- What are you guys doing right now?
- Ah, you scared me.

409
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,250
- Nothing at all.
- What?

410
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,380
- What is it?
- No, it's nothing.

411
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,950
- No.
- Come here.

412
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,830
Hey, Beom Tae. It's this way.

413
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,920
No, this way.

414
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,880
It's nothing.

415
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,710
If you feel any discomfort, don't hesitate to let us know.

416
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,180
Okay.

417
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,750
What are you doing?

418
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,020
Ah, you scared me. Geez.

419
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,630
It's painkillers.

420
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,210
Why are you taking that?

421
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,290
Are you going to take them all in one go and die?

422
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,080
Oh, yes. And when I go,

423
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,480
there's someone whom I have to take along.

424
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:56,080
It's okay. It's okay.

425
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,360
It's okay!

426
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,730
It did seem like he was meeting someone.

427
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,480
But are you sure that you will get something related to the illegal gambling ring?

428
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,690
That I don't know.

429
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,680
Because the one I'm chasing now

430
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,180
isn't an illegal gambling ring.

431
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,320
What did you say?

432
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,290
I'm chasing the guy who threatened my student's life.

433
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,910
How do I enlarge this?

434
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,940
The magnifying glass.

435
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,440
Professor Yu Dong Man

436
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,080
Incoming call- Professor Yu Dong Man

437
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,340
Seon Ho.

438
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,310
We found out.

439
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,190
We confirmed everything.

440
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,900
There are only three places where the keypad has been replaced because of the change

441
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,490
in the security company.

442
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:26,780
And only those keypads use a blue security card like this one.

443
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,180
There are a total of three places in the school where the security keypad has been replaced with a new one.

444
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,590
The library, the gym, and ...

445
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,850
the shooting range.

446
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,790
Right? You get it, don't you?

447
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,240
Students are strictly prohibited from entering

448
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,760
and the security is strict.

449
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,260
But it is easy for the professors to come and go.

450
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,060
I have to check it out.

451
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,820
Right now? There are so many eyes on us.

452
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,740
Bro. Give me the security card.

453
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,890
- Beom Tae and I will check after the roll call.
- What?

454
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,560
Hey, you can't go because of Min Gyu anyway.

455
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,410
We share a room, so we won't get caught.

456
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,760
Yes. We will just go and confirm it.

457
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,510
All we have to do is check to see if the security card opens the door.

458
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,820
There won't be any problems.

459
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,720
It's already time for roll call.

460
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,830
- Hello.
- Hey, come here.

461
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,240
Tae Jin and Seong Su, you guys are doing the evening patrol this week, right?

462
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,180
- Yes.
- Ah!

463
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,360
Sunbaenim, I'll do it instead of Seong Su this week.

464
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,610
You said you had some assignment to finish, right?

465
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:53,050
Ah, I'll do it next week then.

466
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,690
Okay, then let Tae Jin and Min Gyu do it this week.

467
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,180
Okay.

468
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,750
Male Dormitory

469
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,590
We will just check and come back.

470
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,870
Security Out
Do you want to run this program?

471
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,070
Security Out

472
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,180
What happened?

473
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,390
Is it a black out?

474
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,720
It looks like only the main building's power is out.

475
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,220
The circuit breaker must be out again. Hurry up and call the facilities team.

476
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,780
Okay.

477
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,880
This is it.

478
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,350
- You scared me!
- Be quiet!

479
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,890
Seon Ho, we just got here.

480
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:33,380
We'll check and come back.

481
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,650
I'm going to try it.

482
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,680
It worked!

483
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,660
Hey, No Beom Tae! Jo Jun Wuk!

484
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,150
My eyes.

485
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,500
Hey, Min Gyu, you're not going to report us to the student council, right?

486
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,730
If you do that it'll be really bad, Min Gyu.

487
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,950
Hey, don't do that. Min Gyu, just...

488
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,680
Come on.

489
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,440
- We're classmates.
- Min Gyu.

490
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,420
Don't you think there must be a reason?

491
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:23,960
How can they answer if you corner them?

492
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,690
Shouldn't we give them plenty of time?

493
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,650
We gave them plenty of time, Professor.

494
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:35,330
After the roll call, they left without permission and were even snooping around in front of the restricted student access area.

495
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:39,030
And the student council patrol caught them.

496
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,570
If they can't tell you why they were there, it means they were trying to sneak into the shooting range.

497
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,820
What do they think they're doing by exercising their right to remain silent? Like they're trying to deceive the school.

498
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,110
To be honest, I think they should be expelled.

499
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:54,230
Even for the sake of disciplining by school regulations, we should give them strict punishment.

500
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,590
We should start the disciplinary committee hearing right away.

501
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,550
What do you think Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil?

502
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,710
I think the disciplinary committee meeting will be held right away.

503
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,670
What do we do?

504
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,620
Guys, what the hell is...

505
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:42,100
Min Gyu must have seen us while on patrol and followed.

506
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:47,330
Hey, it's fine. We'll just get some disciplinary action.

507
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,150
I'll talk to them.

508
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:53,810
I'll go in and tell them it's because of me—that I ordered you guys to do it.

509
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:58,280
There you go again. Are you going to make us look like idiots?

510
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:06,200
This is our problem to solve and you have to solve your problem.

511
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,590
Here.

512
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,980
We'll see you afterward.

513
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,380
I don't think they will get expelled, will they?

514
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,330
They'll probably just scare them.

515
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:37,240
It was the shooting range. There are even guns in there.

516
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,230
- Even in the army, you would get into big trouble.
- What's going to happen?

517
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,210
Are you sure they went into the shooting range?

518
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,130
What?

519
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,220
Did they really touch the guns?

520
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,460
According to the first eyewitness, Park Min Gyu, a first-year on the student council,

521
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,090
it is clear that the two students were standing at the entrance of the shooting range, not inside the shooting range,

522
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,220
and the student council conducted the first interrogation,

523
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:08,570
but neither of them spoke about why they were in front of the shooting range.

524
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:19,720
All right. Student Han Min Guk, you can go out now.

525
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,570
Disciplinary Committee

526
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:34,790
Disciplinary Committee

527
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,580
Kang Hui.

528
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:07,770
Okay, it was a probably mistake back then.

529
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,690
But, if you keep going, it's no longer a mistake.

530
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:16,190
You really have to take responsibility for everything.

531
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:26,890
This is our problem to solve and you have to solve your problem.

532
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,750
Professor Yu Dong Man

533
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,280
Professor Yu Dong Man

534
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,220
The customer cannot answer the phone–

535
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,230
This punk is really...

536
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,280
Oh Kang Hui

537
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,770
What is it?

538
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:42,520
This morning, an attendance notice was issued to the subjects accordingly

539
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,930
for disciplinary review of 41st class students No Beom Tae and Jo Jun Wuk.

540
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,550
Are you the subjects of this review?

541
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:54,820
Yes, sir. I am No Beom Tae from the 41st class.

542
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,850
Yes, sir. I am Jo Jun Wuk from the 41st class.

543
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,600
The two students are referred to the Student Disciplinary Committee in accordance with the disciplinary rules of the National Police University

544
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,180
for violating the provisions of Article 47, paragraph 1 of the Gyeongdae Rules.

545
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:12,280
You both may state facts or present evidence in your defense, either in writing or orally,

546
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,560
and may also request a re-deliberation within 10 days of disciplinary action.

547
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,000
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,110
The aforementioned case was witnessed by 41st class Park Min Gyu, a student on duty,

549
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,690
in front of the shooting range, which is a restricted area for students, around 00:11 on September 7th,

550
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,690
when students 41st class students, No Beom Tae and Jo Jun Wuk left the dormitory after 22:00

551
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,320
when the evening roll-call was over.

552
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,860
Patient Yu Dong Man.

553
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,590
Patient Yu Dong Man.

554
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,290
During that time last night, there was a power outage in the main building so nothing was recorded.

555
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,160
What? A power outage?

556
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,480
Yes, the facility team came and checked everything as well.

557
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,460
What's going on? What happened?

558
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:13,060
So, are you exercising your right to remain silent?

559
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:31,100

If you don't want a hole in your head then get up, punk.

581
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,000
Slowly.

582
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,260
Slowly...

583
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,010
Turn around.

584
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,580
See? I knew you'd make this choice.

585
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:47,260
You and I are both breaking the law.

586
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,850
But you're a police university student.

587
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:52,990
As for me? I'm a fugitive.

588
00:56:55,530 --> 00:57:00,800
What I'm saying is I think that you and I are not different.

589
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,570
Right?

590
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,070
He's different from you.

591
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,760
So save your bullshit for prison, you jerk.

592
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,280
Previously ...

593
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,010
Kang Hui.

594
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,660
I told Min Gyu to keep an eye on Kang Seon Ho and you guys.

595
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,080
- What?
- What are you saying?

596
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,450
Why did you do that?

597
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:57,090
Because I didn't know you'd take it this far.

598
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,940
Because I thought you guys would give up before that.

599
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:07,350
Because I thought that was the only way to protect Seon Ho.

600
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,180
Listen to me carefully.

601
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,540
Now that this has happened, keep the professors of the disciplinary committee busy

602
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:27,860
and keep exercising your right to remain silent until the end to stall for time.

603
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:33,560
While Seon Ho tries to open the safe, we won't let the real owner of the safe

604
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,390
show up.

605
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,840
It's going to be dangerous

606
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,730
for you guys and for me.

607
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:52,320
It's possible we might not be able to go to this school anymore.

608
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,160
If that happens, do you think you can do it?

609
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:10,280
That's the only way to protect Seon Ho.

610
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,750
Yes, of course, we have to.

611
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,050
Professor, it's Oh Kang Hui.

612
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:38,520
Beom Tae and Jun Wuk were caught by the disciplinary committee, and I think Seon Ho is going to see this through to the end.

613
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,820
I think I need to go to Seon Ho, Professor.

614
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,870
Don't get hurt

615
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:51,860
until I get there. Never.

616
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,250
Kang Hui.

617
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,400
Hurry up and take care of that. We don't have time.

618
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,730
Okay.

619

01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,880
You saw the photo, didn't you?

622
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,190
You bastard, what are you trying to do right now?

623
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:40,420
What do you mean? I'm trying to catch you all and lock you up.

624
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,940
Seon Ho hurry!

631
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,590
Shut up and listen to me first.

632
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,710
If you mess with my students one more time,

633
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:00,750
I'll follow you to the depths of hell to catch you.

634
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:10,040
I ordered the students to do it

635
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:14,760
to catch the criminal hiding in the National Police University.

636
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:23,180
So, instead of the students, talk to me

637
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,280

642
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,830
Police University

643
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:30,970
And there is someone who received a larger amount than Han Jeong Sik.

644
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:35,480
We protected your frivolous justice with the money we earned there!

645
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,230
Didn't I tell you I'll follow you to the depths of hell to catch you?

646
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,090
Let's go, Professor.

647
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,360
It looks like that punk Kang Seon Ho will get expelled.

648
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,940
Am I part of your decision making?

649
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,640
The woman you spoke to on the phone.

650
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,640
She had double eyelids and was tall, that's you, Choi Hui Su.

651
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,950
Come to the school, I'll be waiting for you.

652
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:53,320
I told you that I would take care of it.

653
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,390
You're under arrest without a warrant.

654
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,950
Take Dong Man.

655
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,670
- Team Leader
- Professor.

656
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:59,590
What the hell are you doing right now?!

657
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:01,980
♫ Hey yeah yeah yeah ♫

658
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,000
♫ Hey yeah yeah yeah ♫
