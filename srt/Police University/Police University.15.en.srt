00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,100
Episode 15

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,200
Deceased Kang Dong Yeong / Han Yeong Seon

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,670
Are you watching Seon Ho grow up well?

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,620
Then you know he got into the National Police University.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,340
But now that our son wants to be a police officer,

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,530
when I hear the sirens at night my heart drops.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,690
Watch over Seon Ho from there.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,410
I wanted to hear that I raised him well,

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,000
but he grew up on his own well. I'm thankful every day.

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,810
I'm going to see our son today.

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,360
Let's have a drink together in my dream when I get back.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,790
You should also come, Mrs. Kang.

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,590
Let's get out of here, Seon Ho.

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,950
I think the suspension was too light a punishment

15
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,610
for what this student did,

16
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,860
but you lifted the suspension?

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,680
Chief Park. What Professor Yu Dong Man and Kang Seon Ho

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,010
did was indeed dangerous,

19
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,900
but they did stop the intruder who was in possession of a gun.

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,590
I don't think their behavior is contrary to the ideal that our university teaches and strives for.

21
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,010
I didn't think they committed a serious error.

22
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,200
But still, school regulations—

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,170
Isn't it enough that he'll receive the same discipline

24
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,490
as other students who break school rules and accept responsibility?

25
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,530
It is all my fault.

26
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,820
It is my fault for not being able to predict an incident that could've become an accident.

27
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,470
How would you have predicted that?

28
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,500
I could have.

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,690
I should have.

30
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,830
Letter of Resignation

31
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm sorry for not being here till the end of the semester.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,310
- Chief Professor.
- I made this choice for the sake of school and the students.

33
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,300
This way, no matter what happens

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,750
the school and students are protected.

35
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,760
Leadership Room

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,460
I guess the words, "I've done enough," are used at times like these.

37
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,410
H-Hold on, Kang Hui.

38
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,340
Let's stop here.

39
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,440
Leadership Room

40
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,840
I finished the cleaning and training that I promised to do yesterday.

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,160
All of the third floor, fourth floor, and fifth-floor women's restrooms?

42
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,610
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,270
I'm sorry for going out without permission

44
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,440
while on probation.

45
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,210
I won't do that again.

46
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,680
Can you promise that?

47
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,970
Yes, ma'am.

48
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,710
I'll be watching you. All right?

49
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,380
You can leave.

50
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,460
So what grade, who was it?

51
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,730
It was first-year student Kang Seon Ho's father.

52
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,140
He didn't know he couldn't enter without making a request in advance.

53
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,360
But if it's that student, then he should be at home during his probation. Why would his parent come here?

54
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,040
The phone is turned off. Leave a message after the beep.

55
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,550
Please leave a voice message.

56
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,760
I didn't know that I had to apply in advance to enter.

57
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,510
Almost all parents come without knowing.

58
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,040
Oh, right. Seon Ho is with Professor Yu Dong Man

59
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,780
because of an investigation training, so he's not here.

60
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,140
I see. That's why his phone was turned off.

61
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,700
That's probably why.

62
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,930
Still, I got to see a friendly face, so it was worth the visit.

63
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,540
I bought this to give to you.

64
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,660
For me?

65
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,160
I heard from Seon Ho that you really like peaches.

66
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,720
Seon Ho always talks about you when he calls,

67
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,840
so I when I hear about you I also become happy.

68
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,990
Thank you for making someone who never talked, talk.

69
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,210
I'v kept a student who needs to study for too long.

70
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,130
You should head in now.

71
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,010
I will enjoy these peaches.

72
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,380
Thank you.

73
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,440
Also, if you have time, come visit our house again.

74
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,900
I will make you a lot of good food again.

75
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,880
Head inside.

76
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,050
We established the illegal gambling ring to help you police.

77
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,790
We protected your frivolous justice with the money we earned there!

78
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,490
Who?

79
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,200
Professor Seo Sang Hak?

80
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,260
Did he go to class?

81
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,210
Zelkova Tree Support Association

82
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,970
Account Management Log
Zelkova Tree Support Association

83
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,150
Sit.

84
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,510
It's going to be a long story.

85
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,730
Yes, this is Seo Sang Hak.

86
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,890
Are you Seo Min Wu's guardian?

87
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,480
This is the Sangjin University Hospital.

88
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,800
Professor Seo Sang Hak.

89
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,700
Professor! Professor!

90
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,670
Deceased Seo Min Wu
Father: Seo Sang Hak

91
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,880
Are you really not going in?

92
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,630
Yes.

93
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,320
Then why did you say that you would wait until the funeral is over?

94
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,260
Because even prisoners in jail get a leave when their family member dies.

95
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,970
Then why are you here?

96
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,620
I need to look out for the culprit. There's still a possibility of them escaping.

97
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,600
What is it, punk?

98
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,410
Just because. Earlier Go Deok Bae said

99
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,190
that he's responsible for all the terrible things

100
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,600
and that Professor Seo Sang Hak didn't know about anything.

101
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,230
So? I don't believe in that kind of bullshit,

102
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,710
but if you didn't know, isn't that a crime?

103
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,140
The fact that Professor Seo Sang Hak was the operator of the illegal gambling group remains unchanged.

104
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,620
He will be arrested as soon as the funeral is over.

105
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,200
Yes, sir.

106
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,640
You go in and offer your condolences.

107
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,960
You aren't a police officer yet,

108
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,640
and because you are just a student who was taught by Professor Seo Sang Hak.

109
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,940
Be polite and pay your respects.

110
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,060
Everyone, attention.

111
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,730
Salute.

112
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,860
At ease.

113
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,390
Wow, there are a lot of National Police University graduates here.

114
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,330
Probably since his son is a National Police University graduate.

115
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,680
But was his son really in a coma for ten years?

116
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,630
Yes, he was injured while arresting a criminal.

117
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,280
I mean how could he keep that a secret?

118
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,790
Do you think there was a reason for him to tell us?

119
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,760
It's about Professor Seo's family and a personal matter.

120
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,990
- What?
- Don't.

121
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,810
You're drunk.

122
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
He lost his wife and his son.

123
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,110
What kind of joy does Professor Seo live for now?

124
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,990
Jae Gyeong, did you happen to see Kang Hui?

125
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,580
Seon Ho.

126
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,750
Professor Seo canceled your suspension.

127
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,220
They said you can come back to school on Monday, bro.

128
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,280
It's been really hard, right?

129
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,190
And we heard.

130
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,350
You and Kang Hui...

131
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,270
Are you okay?

132
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,090
- What about Kang Hui?
- Huh?

133
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,440
Did Kang Hui look okay?

134
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,820
Kang Hui just offered her condolences and went back to school.

135
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,520
1/28/2019 Han Jeong Sik

136
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,870
Then, on that date, it is correct that you received five million won paid by

137
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,370
the Zelkova Tree Support Association for hospital expenses, right?

138
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,780
I see. Thank you.

139
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,720
I think it's correct that only the amount for Department Head Han doesn't match.

140
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,780
What should we do?

141
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,970
Team Leader, Department Head Han took a half-day today.

142
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,670
He said he was suddenly feeling sick in the afternoon.

143
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,250
Sick? What bullshit.

144
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,150
First, I will apply for an arrest warrant for Han Jeong Sik with these two documents.

145
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:08,920
But I don't think it will be easy to connect the gambling gang to the ledger and the factory delivery history.

146
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,500
It doesn't matter because that jerk received money for sure.

147
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,860
Find clear evidence that Han Jeong Sik helped the illegal gambling group as soon as possible.

148
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,660
He received that much from them, so there has to be something to connect him to them.

149
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,630
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,300
Let's start.

151
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,190
- Hello?
- This is Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil from the National Police University.

152
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,460
An arrest without a warrant for Department Head Han is now underway.

153
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,150
I'm sorry I suspected you, Professor Choi.

154
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,590
I'm also sorry I couldn't tell you when I knew who the culprit was.

155
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,640
I told him to turn himself in.

156
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,150
He asked for time to take care of things at the school, so I waited.

157
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,930
But you came to me.

158
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,970
When did you find out?

159
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,500
The day we arrested Go Deok Bae.

160
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,610
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

161
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,810
The external hard drive that came out that day as evidence

162
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,990
was my husband's.

163
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,020
So I went to see Department Head Han.

164
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,200
I wanted to check the evidence again.

165
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,490
There is no such external hard drive among the evidence.

166
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,960
That's not possible. I definitely saw it.

167
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,170
Did you maybe mistake it for something else?

168
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,610
After that, as you know, I went to meet Go Deok Bae.

169
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,030
Seoul Namdong-bu Detention Center

170
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,560
She told me she was going to Daejeon.

171
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:37,760
I wanted to know why my husband's property was involved in illegal gambling.

172
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,530
Then suddenly, the support association appeared.

173
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,120
Did Lee Ju Won start the Zelkova Tree Support Association?

174
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,140
At first.

175
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,080
After first, Ju Won, his partner Min Wu,

176
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,170
and Min Wu's father, Professor Seo. The three of them started the support association.

177
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,060
But not too long after,

178
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,820
one person died and the other person was injured.

179
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,330
Where's Lee Ju Won? He's a police officer, his name is Lee Ju Won.

180
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,870
- Where are you going?
- Ma'am!
- It was you, right?

181
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,280
That's what happened to my baby while they were saving you?

182
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,490
They were trying to save people like you... My Min Wu and Ju Won...

183
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,840
Ma'am.

184
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,830
Bring them back! Bring them back!

185
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,230
Bring back my baby and Ju Won's lives.

186
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,570
Because of you, why— Why did my baby...

187
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,990
What are you saying... Why Ju Won...

188
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,960
Bring them back! Bring them back!

189
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,850
I didn't know either

190
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,990
that the person that Ju Won and Min Wu saved was Professor Go.

191
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,040
It's funny, isn't it?

192
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,550
I didn't recognize him even though he was right in front of me.

193
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,470
How could you recognize him? It's been ten years.

194
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,950
But if I'd recognized him earlier,

195
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,390
I could have stopped Professor Seo even sooner.

196
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,060
How did that picture happen?

197
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:06,100
Five years ago, Professor Seo said he was running the support association again, so I attended.

198
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:12,190
After that, neither Professor Seo nor I talked about the support association again.

199
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,130
If we had talked about that, then we have had to talk about Ju Won

200
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,900
and Min Wu.

201
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,400
Like you said, it's been ten years.

202
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,560
After seeing his son lying in a coma for a long time,

203
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,230
did Professor Seo make such a wrong choice?

204
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,520
There is no person here without a damn back story.

205
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,330
Then does that mean anyone with a back story can do a shitty thing like that?

206
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,850
Seon Ho, then we'll see you at school after the weekend.

207
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,300
It is not right for just you and Jae Gyeong to be here. This is not right.

208
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,660
Let's stay together, bro.

209
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,240
Let's go and eat together. Please?

210
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,910
Are you really going to be like this?

211
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,370
Professor.

212
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,390
Eat up.

213
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,570
Only if you eat up can you go and tell the police the truth.

214
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:04,400
If you have to weigh all the evidence that has come out piece by piece, whether it's the motive for the crime

215
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,060
or from whom to whom, who was the accomplice until now,

216
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,980
you need to eat well.

217
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,120
I can't understand what you did.

218
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,010
No. I won't understand.

219
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,050
Even if you earned that money to help the police,

220
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,660
it's a fact that you used government authority to commit crimes.

221
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:42,360
So, don't say you did that to protect the police.

222
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:47,120
Because while chasing the illegal gambling website that you established and ran,

223
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,910
a policewoman called Kim Eun Ju died.

224
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:58,000
Park Cheol Jin, a police officer, who believed that was the right thing to do is now in jail.

225
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:04,610
Go Deok Bae who came out of jail committed a crime once again because of you.

226
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,190
Finally,

227
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,850
it doesn't change the fact that you corrupted a police officer like Han Jeong Sik.

228
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,800
So, don't say that you acted like that

229
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,390
to keep your bullshit-like beliefs, ever again.

230
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,210
I am...

231
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,940
sorry for all that.

232
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,090
You should apologize in front of the law

233
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,310
and the students, not in front of me.

234
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,520
You will be turned in first thing tomorrow morning.

235
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,790
Okay.

236
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,960
Let's do that.

237
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,820
Yes. Did you arrest Chief Han?

238
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,940
Payment Ledger

239
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,650
Get him.

240
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,220
I was wondering where the hell you were getting so much money,

241
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,140
but I found out that you were raising it yourself.

242
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,150
What are you saying Chief Han?

243
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,520
What's with you?

244
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,140
I also have a stake in this support association.

245
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,260
You must have forgotten that I worked hard

246
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,240
to keep you anonymous.

247
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,810
Let's talk at the police station, and I'll tell them everything.

248
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,020
What should I confess?

249
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,830
I respect your decision.

250
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,000
When you donate to the Seoul Police Agency,

251
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,650
you can just send a little more to me,

252
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,220
about ten million won per month.

253
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,310
Since you got your noble hands dirty,

254
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,180
you should go all the way, Sunbaenim.

255
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,290
Just because you want to stop now,

256
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,000
what you did won't disappear.

257
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,320
Shouldn't it be that no more police officers get hurt like Min Wu did?

258
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,970
Grab him.

259
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,360
Let go.

260
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,840
Chief Han—

261
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:09,600
Han Jeong Sik, you are under arrest without a warrant on charges of aiding gambling and taking bribes under the Special Act.

262
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,570
It's not me.

263
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:15,490
I just accepted the donations they gave me!

264
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,860
You can hire a lawyer.

265
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,700
This... This is all Seo Sang Hak's plan.

266
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,330
Let go of me! Get your hands off of me!

267
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,270
We should add singing loudly to his charges.

268
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,180
You guys are going to regret this.

269
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,640
You are arresting an innocent person!

270
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,410
Let go. Let go!

271
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,900
Hey! Let go! Hey! Let go!

272
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,680
You guys are going to regret this.

273
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,600
Let go. Let me go!

274
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,960
Ah! Hey! Let go!

275
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,650
You should apologize in front of the law

276
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,050
and the students, not in front of me.

277
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,270
Is taking some money from the bad guys a big crime?

278
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,710
Do you think the law will let you guys go

279
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,460
just because you're poor and things are tough, and you didn't have any other choice?

280
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,790
Professor!

281
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,260
National Police University Obituary Notice
2/8/2016
Inspector Kim Han Sol (Age 27) Sky Funeral Hall 1st floor

282
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,370
I am sorry.

283
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,540
What can I do,

284
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,800
so that no one

285
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,920
gets hurt anymore?

286
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,970
What...

287
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,670
should I do?

288
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,790
Is that your last?

289
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:28,120
Is that the last action you will take?

290
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:36,450
I also committed a crime just like you, Professor.

291
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,390
Because I wanted the operation fee for my dad.

292
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,430
So, I stole money by hacking the illegal gambling website

293
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:53,800
because I thought using that bad money for something good, like my dad's operation, wasn't bad.

294
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,310
But Professor Yu Dong Man said,

295
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,000
just because you have a back story or because you had no choice,

296
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,910
the law won't turn a blind eye.

297
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,500
Yes,

298
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,050
looking at your last action. I think I understand that better.

299
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,830
That something like that will never happen.

300
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,010
We cannot protect anything by such actions and

301
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:29,750
running away won't make your crimes disappear.

302
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,260
So, come with me, Professor.

303
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,710
Let's go and show me that you are paying for your crimes.

304
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:54,050
I can learn from you and live properly only if you do this.

305
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:01,670
Even if your first choice was wrong, this time

306
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,300
you can make the right choice.

307
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,930
I...

308
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,430
don't have the right to do so.

309
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,700
Yes, you don't have the right.

310
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:35,750
You are someone, who like a coward tried to run away from paying for your crimes.

311
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,860
Just as Seon Ho said, is this your last?

312
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:52,670
I respected you before as an elder.

313
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,380
You have admitted to all charges of bribery under the Special Act in violation of

314
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,500
the Act on the Concealment of Crime Proceeds from Gambling Operations.

315
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,000
Mr. Seo Sang Hak, come with us now.

316
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,930
That is how the investigation that Professor and I were doing came to an end.

317
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:06,020
Have you shared any investigation information with the management team

318
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,950
of an illegal gambling site that operated from December 2006 to June 2021?

319
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,000
Yes. The investigation status and information on Inspector Yu Dong Man, who was the investigator in charge,

320
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,210
I continuously shared with Go Deok Bae.

321
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,440
After Park Cheol Jin was arrested, the site reopened on June 24th after no activity.

322
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,060
I was going to get some money and go abroad.

323
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,700
I am sorry, but I really don't know anything.

324
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,730
I just did what the people above told me to do.

325
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:50,010
Go Deok Bae said that there was a police officer who would cover up for us

326
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,980
and that we would never get caught.

327
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,550
You can use a lie detector if you want.

328
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,580
In return, you put a total of more than 200 million won

329
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:04,050
in your back pocket for two years.

330
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,360
After Go Deok Bae was caught, you even conspired to kill a police officer!

331
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,500
I don't know. I have never done that.

332
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,760
You can talk to my lawyer once he is here.

333
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,720
No, Department Head Han requested the slush fund himself.

334
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,320
What were the exact circumstances...?

335
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:28,400
Two years ago, department head Han Jeong Sik found out about the source of the funds and threatened us.

336
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,680
As a condition to keep quiet, we had to deposit ten million won

337
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,160
each month into a fake bank account owned by Han Jeong Sik.

338
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,820
There is a backup of the text message requesting the opening of a fake bank account.

339
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,620
I will submit it as evidence.

340
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:46,220
Do you admit that you transferred a portion of the proceeds

341
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:52,260
to Han Jeong Sik, a police officer at the Seoul Police Agency, through the Zelkova Tree Support Association

342
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,390
for allegedly opening and operating an illegal gambling website and onsite location?

343
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,990
Yes.

344
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,390
I acknowledge all of that.

345
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:41,200
Professor Seo Sang Hak

346
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,800
For the time being, Professor Gwon Hyeok Pil has decided to take over as the faculty head.

347
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,510
I understand that the students may be confused due to the series of events.

348
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:02,840
We professors should hold classes just as we used to without changing anything so that it doesn't affect the students.

349
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,830
- Yes.
- Yes.

350
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,280
I kind of understand, though,

351
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,430
what kind of intentions professor Seo Sang Hak had in his mind when doing that.

352
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,660
Me too.

353
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,710
My parents go crazy if an article says someone got hurt at Police University so

354
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,810
they don't want me to be a police officer.

355
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,390
I understand what you're saying but don't do that.

356
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,050
Do you think no one would have thought about

357
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,600
helping good people with bad money?

358
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,260
But, they all hold it in and live

359
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,450
because you shouldn't do such things.

360
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,580
The law and the community set rules for us.

361
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,340
Okay?

362
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:01,710
One week has passed but students still only talk about Professor Seo.

363
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,110
Then let's talk about something else.

364
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:12,200
I heard Kang Hui and Seon Ho broke up. Is that true?

365
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm not sure.

366
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,070
I'm not going to bother with that anymore, unless Kang Hui herself comes to me, I guess.

367
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,310
Oh, you are cool.

368
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,570
Ah, why don't you ask me to help you? You asked me to join forces with you.

369
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:37,720
Just because you started feeling like that, I feel the same way.

370
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:44,360
But we put all our effort into our unrequited loves, right?

371
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,700
Huh?

372
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,590
What is this?

373
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:05,230
What is this? What is this? What is this?

374
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:10,270
♫ The place you and I are going to look toward is the same ♫

375
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:15,030
♫ We are going to dream the same dream again. Can you feel it? ♫

376
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,750
You were surprised I called you out of the blue, right?

377
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,360
No, I wasn't.

378
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,070
But what is this about?

379
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,760
I went to the school not that long ago.

380
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,700
I heard that Seon Ho went out on a training with you.

381
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,860
Oh, yes—

382
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,970
We were... doing investigation training.

383
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:58,550
But the leadership professor came out

384
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,370
and said that Seon Ho is suspended.

385
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,930
Yes, so, about that...

386
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,820
Professor.

387
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,340
What on earth has Seon Ho been doing?

388
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,730
Investigation Notes

389
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,990
The choice you make comes with responsibility.

390
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,810
What's most important when investigating is catching the criminal.

391
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,150
You're wrong.

392
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:58,160
What's most important when investigating is catching the criminal.

393
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,060
What does a police officer need the most? A partner.

394
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,190
I also can be wrong and make mistakes.

395
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,360
That's why a cop needs a partner,

396
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,540
and two is probably better than one.

397
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,600
What are you doing?

398
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
Let's go together.

399
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,960
Just calm down for a second!

400
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,460
I'm going to catch that damn rat!

401
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,360
All right.

402
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,470
Don't avoid, don't stop,

403
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,410
and keep moving forward.

404
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,800
We can't avoid it even if we want to,

405
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,850
and we can't change anything by doing nothing.

406
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,920
You crazy jerk.

407
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,030
We can face whatever it is only if we proceed.

408
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,660
Professor Seo Sang Hak.

409
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:56,300
If only I don't give up, justice will surely come.

410
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,800
Nevertheless, if our police don't give up,

411
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,670
if only we don't give up,

412
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:08,120
justice will surely come.

413
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,540
So, let's never give up

414
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,320
on any case.

415
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,890
Do you understand?

416
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,840
Yes, sir!

417
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,990
You're not dozing off, and you're paying attention to class.

418
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,290
I'm going to be a police officer soon.

419
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,610
Me too.

420
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,400
Fighting!

421
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,900
♫ The person who calls me, comes to me and hugs me ♫

422
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:53,440
♫ Your name is another me ♫

423
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:59,930
♫ With a sunshine like heart which shines after it rains ♫

424
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:07,240
♫ Your name which loves me more than I love myself ♫

425
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:14,200
♫ I guess you're another me. I guess you're like that. ♫

426
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:21,100
♫ You are the only person who resembles me ♫

427
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:28,390
♫ When you look at me when you always touch me ♫

428
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:34,010
♫ I feel the reason I open my eyes every day ♫

429
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:38,420
Did you get in contact with your father?

430
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,150
My father?

431
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,720
Yes.

432
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,570
No. I haven't been able to think of that.

433
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:52,770
Your father came to school while we were at the funeral that day.

434
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:53,980
What?

435
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,540
He said he was nearby and stopped by to see you.

436
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:06,150
I told him you weren't at school because you were with Professor Yu Dong Man for training.

437
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,860
He asked if we were doing well and I said yes.

438
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:17,310
So if you talk with him, you can explain to him.

439
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:27,180
He said he bought peaches for me.

440
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:32,900
He only bought ones that were perfect.

441
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,530
Tell him, thank you for

442
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,920
treating me kindly.

443
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:52,840
It'll probably be uncomfortable if we break up.

444
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,460
Even if we go to the same school, I thought we could avoid each other,

445
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,060
but we can't.

446
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:05,070
This is really hard.

447
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,860
I'm...

448
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:15,080
I'm really sorry, Kang Hui.

449
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,750
I thought I could be

450
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,960
next to you if I did this.

451
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,380
After catching the culprit,

452
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,870
and the investigation being over,

453
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:38,030
then I thought I'd be able

454
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,250
to be there for you confidently.

455
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,410
At least

456
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,580
wouldn't I deserve to be a police officer...

457
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,040
♫ Our images will ♫

458
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,970
if I was with you?

459
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:54,720
♫ remain in that place ♫

460
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,180
Although it's pathetic, I thought something like that.

461
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,710
♫ I who was unable to to hug you ♫

462
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,960
But it's not true.

463
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:07,270
♫ The you who smiled at me when you saw me like that ♫

464
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:13,640
♫ From behind me getting farther away whether I keep reaching for you or not ♫

465
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,220
♫ Warmly so you won't get sick ♫

466
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,250
So,

467
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:21,530
♫ I won't see it ♫

468
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,040
Kang Hui.

469
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,630
Tomorrow is our leave.

470
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,440
Meet me in front of the main gate at 11 o'clock tomorrow.

471
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,460
I'm going to head in first.

472
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:51,940
♫ From behind me getting farther away whether I keep reaching for you or not ♫

473
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:55,710
♫ Warmly. so that you won't get sick, ♫

474
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,930
♫  So that I won't see you ♫

475
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:05,490
♫ Even the image of you hugging me who was crying ♫

476
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,240
♫ remains ♫

477
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,510
Professor Yu Dong Man

478
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,870
Hey, Park Min Gyu.

479
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,350
Police University

480
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,290
Shall we go?

481
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:37,170
National Police University

482
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,770
It's pretty.

483
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,730
But why did we come to Jeongeup?

484
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,820
I used to live here

485
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:07,160
with my grandma whenever my mom went to prison.

486
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:19,440
When I came here when I was young, I really wanted to eat this ice cream.

487
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:21,740
This isn't anything special.

488
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:27,510
I couldn't ask her to buy it for me. I guess I was walking on eggshells around adults.

489
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,490
My grandma wouldn't have thought of it that way.

490
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:50,050
Professor's Office
Yu Dong Man

491
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:53,280
Professor Yu Dong Man

492
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,420
Let's take a picture too.

493
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,940
- I'll take it.
- No, together.

494
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,710
- Excuse me, can you take a picture for us please?
- Yes.

495
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,100
Just a moment.

496
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:26,330
Ready, one, two, three.

497
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,710
Should we take one over there?

498
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,810
That's good.

499
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,460
One, two!

500
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,870
One, two, three!

501
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,070
It came out well.

502
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:57,840
When we were dating, we never went on a date or anything like that.

503
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,570
That's why.

504
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,670
- Kang Hui.
- I know.

505
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:10,080
You're planning on leaving school.

506
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,570
I told you earlier,

507
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,410
this is where I used to go every time my mom went to prison.

508
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,890
It's a farewell place.

509
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:30,340
For me, this place is where I said goodbye to my mom,

510
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,840
waited for her, and met her again.

511
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:42,000
But this time, it's with you.

512
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,860
I ...

513
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,130
don't want to say goodbye to you.

514
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,800
Even if I was beaten to death I don't want that.

515
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,630
But, right now...

516
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,160
I don't deserve to be with you.

517
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:12,780
So...

518
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,400
Did you not hear me?

519
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,630
I said this is where I said goodbye to my mom and met her again.

520
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:30,240
So make sure you come back.

521
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,770
Come back and meet me here.

522
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:40,250
When you don't have to go back.

523
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,470
Come back then.

524
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,830
Drop-out Application

525
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,040
Professor, please sign it for me.

526
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,380
You punk...

527
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,700
I'm grateful that you let me

528
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,490
be admitted into this school.

529
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:48,300
Thank you for letting a fool like me

530
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,090
have a dream.

531
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,890
Seon Ho, you punk—

532
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:57,450
I meant what I told

533
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,410
Professor Seo Sang Hak.

534
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,590
I want to stop running away, Professor.

535
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,090
I'll dream of becoming a police officer again

536
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,230
on the day I can stand confidently.

537
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,350
I was sorry

538
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,600
and was always thankful.

539
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,900
Because you were there for me, I was reassured

540
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,380
and supported.

541
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,060
I was so happy...

542
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:08,250
National Police University School Regulations

543
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,140
Hey, Park Min Gyu.

544
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:35,820
Please take good care of Kang Hui, Beom Tae, and Jun Wuk.

545
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,120
What are you talking about?

546
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:45,530
I'm just saying I want you all to get along well.

547
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,330
And the next time we meet,

548
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,870
let's also be friends.

549
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,690
Is Seon Ho really gone?

550
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,810
That jerk.

551
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,660
Yes, Officer Ju.

552
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:29,100
It's my dream to become a police officer.

553
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,300
Dream?

554
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:36,500
My son, Seon Ho, said he really wants to become a cop.

555
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,060
Father!

556
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:42,700
I will make sure to pass!

557
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,270
Let's go.

558
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,500
I think you are the most like a police officer out of all the friends

559
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,460
I've met since entering National Police University.

560
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,610
Yes! It's not over until the match is over!

561
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,930
3rd squad! We can do it!

562
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,690
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

563
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,870
You guys have passed, you jerks.

564
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:07,160
But I never really thought about it.

565
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,240
Who the police are? What they protect?

566
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,440
Then can't you start searching for that from now on?

567
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,410
We just entered school and we just started.

568
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,500
I won't...

569
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,890
run away anymore either.

570
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,620
The people... The people whom I have to protect,

571
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,250
can I find the method to protect them properly

572
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:44,960
as Police University student Kang Seon Ho working together

573
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,350
with you, Professor, instead of Hacker Yoon?

574
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,760
You won't regret it?

575
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,110
What will happen in the future,

576
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,160
whom you'll come to meet,

577
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:01,520
I don't know what danger we'll encounter. Will it really be all right?

578
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,590
Yes.

579
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:06,240
I trust him.

580
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,530
Not you, Professor, but Bird Hyung.

581
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:10,040
We won!

582
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,080
We won!

583
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,570
Son!

584
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,640
Father.

585
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:02,260
♫ Yes, At the time when you are too exhausted ♫

586
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:08,300
♫ When you are pointlessly lonely you can call my name ♫

587
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:15,300
♫ Okay, when your heart is breaking ♫

588
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:23,100
♫ When you sometimes cry you can come to me ♫

589
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,100
♫ On a tough day ♫
