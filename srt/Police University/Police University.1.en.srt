- I guess this seat is unlucky.

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,650
It's because of the water vein. The water vein. Not my fault.

My goal isn't a medal. It's Park Eun Ji.

64
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,520
I didn't make it to the finals anyway, so I'm just going to ask her out in the best way possible.

65
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,580
You psycho. What are you going to say?

66
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,170
I love you. Be mine. You're more precious than a medal.

67
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,300
Are you serious?

68
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,170
Yeah. Eun Ji is more precious to me than a medal.

69
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,810
Hey, what's your ideal type again?

70
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,630
A girl. Eun Ji's a girl.

71
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,540
Sure... how would you know what love is?

72
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,840
I know what love is!

73
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,020
When right here it's itchy and you want to scratch it.

74
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,620
Eun Ji, you're all I have.

75
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,110
Seung Beom, you're all I have too.

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,300
Let's be together forever.

77
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,080
I wonder what he likes so much about her.

78
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,290
What makes her feel so desperate?

79
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,720
What's so funny to them?

80
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,050
I don't get it.

81
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,080
But I get it!

82
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,470
I have only this one chance to get a bronze medal.

83
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,120
What is this small injury that I have to forfeit the match?
Hancheon Girls' High

It doesn't make any sense!

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,960
I understand, but why don't you, Coach!

86
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,750
Hey! This is the only arm you have. Don't insist on something like this!

87
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,120
Even if my arm breaks, it'll heal!

88
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,040
This moment only comes once. I'm going to do what I want, without any regrets.

89
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,500
Isn't this because you don't want to lose?

90
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,720
Is there anyone in this world who wants to lose?

91
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,770

95
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:07,340
I was curious. What exactly makes her feel so desperate to win.

96
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,630
Where does that kind of heart come from?

♫ Truly. I wanna know, I wanna know with all my mind ♫

101

Hey, Student.

119
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,960
Is the electric bulletin board your work?

120
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,940
- The concept was terrible.
- No, that's...

124
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,640
You crybaby. Why would you go around alone like that!

125
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,370
I had intel.

126
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,630
That jerk in the yellow suit.

127
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,980
He was supposed to be the manager of the VIP gambling room.

128
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,970
- Oh, really?
- He was just a hoodlum.

129
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,300
There wasn't even that much time before the operation! You should have just waited.

130
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,930
How could I do that? I lost 100,000,000₩ (approximately $97,000 USD).

131
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,260
I mean, who told you to gamble away your lease deposit and even take out a loan?

132
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,580
You jerk. You did that on purpose!

I told you you'd get a virus a few times.

No.

141
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,190
I didn't have any intention of clicking the ad!

142
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:10,540
But the mouse, that mouse moved on its own!

143
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,120
You're not going to change your laptop, are you?

144
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,460
The rent on this place is 1700.

145
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,160
If I had the money, I would have already replaced it.

146
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,970
Should I raise the rent and get a new laptop?

147
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,410
Oh... I can just fix it for you!

I'm sure you could use this for another ten years!

149
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,220
Just make sure my dad—

150
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,170
Ahjussi doesn't find out.

151

You grew up so well.

152
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,040
Who would look at you and think you came from that background?

No one knows.

If you're 19, it's time for you to become independent!

Mr. Yun really worked hard.

156
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,520
What are you making this kid do right now? He should be studying.

157
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,230
- Go inside!
- Oh, that's not it.
- Go inside!

Really? Let's all sleep.

159
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,190
Dad, you're going to faint at that rate.

160
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,710
Wow... Mr. Yun has so many sons who worry about him.

161
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,670
Must be nice! I'm leaving.

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,870
To talk about college.

164
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,790
What about your class?

165
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,490
Not yet.

166
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,090
Kang Dong Yeon
09/13/1968 - 07/30/2011

167
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,480
Are you Seon Ho?

168
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,860
I'm your dad's friend.

169
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,220
My name is Yun Taek Il.

170
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,920
Let's go to my house.

171
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,730
Say you lost! Say that you lost!

172
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,690
No! I won't even if I die!
[Yun Seung Beom]

173
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,920
- Leave, you jerk! Go back to where you came from!
[Yun Seung Beom]

174
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,500
Get out of my house!

175
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,610
I lost.

176
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,900
Get out! Get out! I said get out!

177
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,920
Mommy...

178
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,160
What does your father do? What does he do!

179
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,100
All the other parents came in, except for yours!

180
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,150
You didn't tell him, did you?

181
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,980
Please just sign me up for any college.

182
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,770
That's what I'm saying! I'm giving you

183
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,900
the list of colleges with scholarships and housing just like you asked!

184
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,260
Please just put me anywhere on this list.

185
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,420
I understand your situation

186
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,790
but don't you have dreams?

187
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,600
Anything you want to do?

188
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,480
Anything you want to accomplish? Don't you have anything like that?

189
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,930
Career Aspirations

190
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,690
Well... then be a civil servant.

191
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:09,110
Even with your grades, if you want to get in, you're going to have to get into shape.

192
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,530
Because it's a special public university, there's tuition support, housing support

193
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,740
and a lot of other support too.
 National Police University Recruiting

194
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,540
How nice. You'll become a police officer right after graduating.

195
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,430
People without anywhere to lean on

196
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,980
should choose the most secure path.

197
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,330
- What do you want to eat?
- I want sweet and sour pork.

198
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,890
Sweet and sour pork?

199
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,060
Gum: Dad says he wants to wait for you and get noodles before going home.

200
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,940
Gum: Dad says he wants to wait for you and get noodles before going home.

201
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,720
What time do you finish?

202
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,210
I have study hall.

National Police University

204
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,740
On my way to tutoring academy.

Police Station

206
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,220
Police University - Acceptance Rate #1!

207
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,640
Police University?

208
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,860
What? Did you see something?

209
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,690
It's nothing.

210
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,710
Are you getting ready for the written test?

211
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,150
I barely made the cut. You are safe, right?

212
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,400
I'm still nervous. If I don't make it, I'm just going to die.

213
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,980
For me, it's because of my dad, but why do you want to go to Police University so badly?

214
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,960
It's my dream to become a police officer.

215
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,550
Dream?

216
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,980
- Let's go.
- Okay.

217
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,450
Dream Into The Future

218
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,180
But where is the restroom?

219
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,890
Hey, talk to me.

220
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,180
They are using a specialized betting terminal.

221
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,280
If the device malfunctions, they will take it to the main office.

222
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,040
But how do we break it?

223
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,140
There are methods for everything.

224
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,400
We got it.

225
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,130
Okay, you are all dead.

226
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,790
You're all dead.

227
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,140
What? You probably died!

228
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,290
You lost a hundred million won, you idiot!

229
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,810
We have to use at least that much for them to let us know the location of the VIP gambling house. How else could I have done it?

230
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:31,260
Also, if the investigation budget was adequate, I would be crazy to spend my own money.

231
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,790
You psycho.

232
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,610
Do others stay within the investigation budget because they can't do what you did?

233
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,780
You! Last year, you said you were going to catch the voice phishing people and lost a bunch of your own money, too, right!

234
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,110
$13,000 to be exact.

235
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,480
But I caught them, right?

236
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,260
Is it easy to track cyber currency? Even the cyber squad can't do it.

237
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,540
That is why we had to chase them for over a year,

238
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,980
and I got a VIP pass to enter an offline gambling house.

239
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,190
Now, when the device is moved, I am going to capture the leaders and throw them in jail.

240
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,330
Team Leader while you're celebrating, have a memorial service.

241
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,640
Because of you, I think my funeral will be the first thing to happen.

242
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,140
I'm nervous.

243
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,110
Certificate for Examination

244

hackeryoon

246
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,900
Bird: Why are you online so late?

247
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,950
Yoon: Isn't it exam season for you? I thought you were in school this semester.

248
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,080
Bird: It's almost over. Do you have what I asked for?

249
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,530
It's here. An online account backtracing program.

250
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,120
Bird: Oh, thank you, thank you! By the way, did you choose a college yesterday?

251
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,600
Bird: Why aren't you responding? With your grades, aren't you a shoo-in anywhere?

252
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,100
Bird: Yoon?

253
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,500
Reply, Yoon! This isn't even a hard question. He's just not replying.

254
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,960
Is your ID "Bird" (slang for cop) because you are a cop?

255
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,740
Hey, you're dropping formality, aren't you?

256
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,710
You lost all your military discipline already.

257
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,110
It's him, isn't it? Your online friend.

258
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,210
Every night, you give him advice, and every day he tells you his secrets. Right?

259
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,840
Hey. Buzz off.

260
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,670
Why do you treat only me like this?

261
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,870
What punk? Why? What?

262
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,180
The location of the terminal is moving.

263
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,140
Hey! Why didn't you say something sooner!

264
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,080
What? What are you doing?

265
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,830
Where are you going? Team Leader told us to stand by.

266
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,090
Are you nuts? Stay on standby? I'm going to die because I was kicked in the ass and hung out to dry.

267
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,380
Mentor!

268
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,500
Certificate of Examination
Kang Seon Ho

269
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,740
I'm applying to Police University. Tomorrow is the written exam.

270
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,460
Bird has logged off.

271
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,100
Are you not sleeping yet?

272
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,330
Are you going somewhere?

273
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,660
Why are you going on a business trip this late at night?

274
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,420
Hey, I'm trying to make money. Day and night don't mean anything.

275
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,660
I'll go with you then.

276
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,280
It's fine. Go inside and continue doing what you were doing.

277
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,160
You can't even see well at night. Let's go together. I'll drive.

278
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,700
See. You're happy that your son is driving with you, right?

279
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,490
You should go sleep.

280
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,480
You're speeding. You're speeding.

281
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,600
If you get another ticket, our team leader's going to be pissed!

282
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,770
Do you think that criminals obey the speed limit when they're escaping?

283
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,680
- This is why we alone always lose track of them.
- You're crazy.

284
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,710
Am I really just going with you?

285
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,430
Yeah! I already put my lease deposit into this. I even took out the maximum loan from the bank.

286
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,630
Hey. If I blow this $100,000, I'm going to be homeless!

287
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,490
No one told you to do all that!

288
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,810
And of course, I still did it! I'm a police officer!

289
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,640
Mentor, right turn here. Right turn.

290
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,980
Streets in a residential area have a 30 km limit.

291
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,560
Dad. Is this right?

292
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,170
Go a little bit farther and then over there...

293
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,500
Hey, wait, wait! Wait!

294
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,840
Hey!

295
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,730
Oh! Wait!

296
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,380
National Police University Recruiting Test for 2021 Class

297
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,590
Unknown Number

298
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,140
What is this?

299
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,270
Yeah, what's up?

300
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,470
What?

301
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,060
Oh, you dodged it?

302
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,750
You went out to the scene by yourself, and you got into an accident, and a civilian got hurt.

303
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,510
Just become the team leader, the chief, and the commissioner, and do as you damn well please, bastard!

304
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,790
- What are you going to do?
- That's what I mean.

305
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,770
What do you mean what am I going to do?

306
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,710
I'll get my hands on a tail (lower-ranking member) and grill him.

307
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,350
Yeah, talk to me.

308
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,750
Team Leader. These jerks already took off.

309
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,460
What?

310
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,300
Tail, my butt!

311
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,710
Hey, you asshole. They already left the gambling house.

312
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,370
Why do we have to clean up after your solo field operation?

313
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,020
These f***ing ass****s. Jeez.

314
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,830
You! If you plan out a field operation by yourself one more time,

315
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,690
you'll have to get ready to take off your uniform!

316
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,800
Just take it off of me now.

317
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,850
No. I'll take it off.

318
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,860
Hyung. I get that you got old and got soft,

319
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,980
but stop with this nonsense!

320
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,190
A civilian got hurt? Sure.

321
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,480
I committed an unforgivable crime.

322
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,080
I know! I'm upset too!

323
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,970
No. But if you play it safe while running a field operation,

324
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,330
does the criminal say "Yes, thank you. Please arrest me"?

325
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,200
You barely give me any investigation support money,

326
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,470
so how do you expect me to catch the criminals?

327
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,410
Stand by! Stand by! You always say "stand by." Are we five generations on standby?

328
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,490
I'm humiliated and frustrated and sorry too.

329
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,950
I'm going crazy.

330
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,240
So here!

331
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,590
Is this what you want?

332
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,840
Here. All I have left now is my underwear.

333
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,750
What should I do? Should I take this off too? Just say the word! Say it.

334
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,410
Hey, Yu Dong Man are you crazy, you jerk?!

335
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,490
He's my mentor, but he's a psycho.

336
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,290
Oh, I see.

337
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,550
Oh. We're really sorry.

338
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:38,970
My mentor feels so bad that he doesn't think he can bear to see you so...

339
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,520
Oh, the car accident was both parties' fault. It's fine.

340
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,630
Please still accept it.

341
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,950
It's fine.

342
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,380
Should I take it off?

343
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,080
Hey! Look at this jerk. In a hospital in broad daylight, drawing a salary ...

344
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,970
I'm naked in a hospital in broad daylight.

345
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,560
Do you like seeing a 40-year-old guy being kicked in the shins?

346
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,620
Oh my god! Ugh!

347
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,230
Like you did anything right!

348
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,710
Hey you! Didn't you see that Cheol Jin got hurt again because of you?

349
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,130
But it's a relief that your son wasn't injured.

350
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,930
By the way, is he your only son?

351
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,900
I have two, but the other is on his way right now.

352
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,310
That must be reassuring. Having two sons.

353
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,470
My son just arrived.

354
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,280
I do feel reassured.

355
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,190
It's cancer.

356
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:47,030
Stage 1 is usually hard to detect. The accident could be called lucky in this instance.

357
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,310
So you're saying he'll be okay after getting surgery?

358
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,340
In order for him to be okay,

359
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,320
I'm suggesting the David robot surgery.
Prostate Cancer David Robot Surgery Explanation

360
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,300
How much does it cost?

361
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,940
Since it's not covered by insurance, the hospital bill would be about $7,000.

362
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,780
If not, we can use a standard method of proximal removal—

363
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,080
Removal?!

364
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,560
Oh, not that kind of removal.

365
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,630
We must do the David robot surgery. Absolutely.

366
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,320
Oh, how did that happen to him?

367
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,310
He's such a nice and honest man.

368
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,320
Where is the hospital?

369
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,280
I'm going to go there immediately!

370
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,290
Even if you go now, you won't be able to visit him.

371
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,910
But about that...

372
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,970
our father...

373
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,950
Please lend our dad some money.

374
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,420
The surgery costs $7,000.

375
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,380
But I will definitely pay you back once I become successful.

376
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,400
Seven thousand?

377
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,900
Okay.

378
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:03,280
Radio Shop

379
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,020
There you go again, looking like an old man.

380
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,380
Hey! Don't live life with so much worry.

381
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,630
Are you without a home or a family?

382
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,950
Yes, Ahjussi.

383
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,050
Don't call me Ahjussi.

384
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,580
Call me Dad, you brat.

385
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,740
Hey. Stop.

386
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,860
I told you to stop. There isn't any money over there.

387
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,040
His tooth has hurt for over six months and he hasn't even gone to the dentist!

388
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,030
He's been taking painkillers and enduring the pain.

389
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,580
Dammit!

390
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,460
We're so damn poor.

391
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,450
Hey, let's go and rob that pawn shop.

392
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,030
You know that man scams even the neighborhood grandma, right?

393
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,850
Honestly, is it a crime to steal money from a bad person?

394
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,470
As of a year ago, the government has been monitoring an illegal gambling...

395
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,270
What are we going to do? There's no solution!

396
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,010
Crackdown Begins on Popular Illegal Gambling Website

397
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,830
The police are...
- No.

398
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,590
There is a solution.

399
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,440
They have revealed their plans to start a special crackdown.

400
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,750
The report was made by Reporter Kim Gyeong Hyeon.

401
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,900
In an office in Busan, this computer screen is filled with withdrawal details.

402
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,150
Mister Yu Dong Nam, as the loan period cannot be extended, please repay the loan in full by the 08/31 due date.

403
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,450
Ah... really.

404
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,970
Yeah.

405
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,660
- Hello.
- Hey.

406
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,080
Hey, I'm begging you.

407
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,520
A kid like me could rise from the dead and never make that kind of money. But you can.

408
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,630
Our dad... you could save him.

409
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,640
It's simple.

410
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,810
Anyway, the money that people gamble with on this site is already virtual currency.

411
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,300
We just have to hack the virtual accounts that these bad guys who run the site are using.

412
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,040
The cyber money that people use to bet with

413
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,240
definitely goes between multiple accounts and then finally gets deposited into a main account.

414
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,480
At that moment, use this program to track the accounts.

415
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,450
Sunbae. The money's moving right now.

416
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,810
Oh, hurry up and go for the main account first.

417
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,450
They won't even be able to report this because it's illegal.

418
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,530
We're going to take just the surgery fee.

419
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,190
Okay.

420
00:35:54,990 --> 00:36:00,020
Your skills improved quickly after fixing people's computers every night.

421
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,610
I found it!

422
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,440
How much would you like send?

423
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,890
If I click enter now, there's no going back.

424
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,130
If something goes wrong, we could go to prison.

425
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,700
Haven't you seen the movie Tazza?

426
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,680
Even if we can't use it, go!

427
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,180
Enter

428
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,410
AccountNumber
+41) Bank of Royal

429
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,410
Yes!

431
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll look into it.

432
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,650
Error

433
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,710
Sunbae! They're getting hacked by somewhere other than us.

434
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,470
What?

435
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,490
Deposit Completed. ₩7,000,000. 
Yeah!

436
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,380
It worked!

437
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,430
It worked!

438
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,880
What are you—

439
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,300
Error
Security Alert

440
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,460
What is this?

441
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,870
This can't happen!

442
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,660
ERROR

443
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,930
I'm doing it right now!

444
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,250
Hey!

445
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,810
The site and the accounts are all gone. Now we have no chance to get these guys.

446
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,220
Everything we worked on for a whole year is gone!

447
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,810
I'm going to compensate you by not accepting your resignation.

448
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,160
You're going to be transferred.

449
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,600
You're off duty! Get out!

450
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,640
How will you get the suspect if you nitpick at everything?

451
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,010
And this time, this wasn't my fault. Some crazy jerk got involved in the middle—

452
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,670
Shut up, you idiot!

453
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,820
I don't need someone on my team who does everything on their own without thinking about the consequences.

454
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,460
Get out.

455
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,900
Get out, you bastard!

456
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,450
Please. Was it called the robot surgery? Well, please do that.

457
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:01,150
That cancer bastard, please make sure it dies right there without going somewhere else.

458
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,360
Your father seems quite upset.

459
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,680
The second son is going to take care of that.

460
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,320
But Noona, how old are you?

461
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm sorry.

462
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,510
If you were to yell and hit me, I'd feel better actually.

463
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,910
Like you would to Seung Beom.

464
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,280
Please rest. Since surgery's tomorrow.

465
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,030
The kids said they worked part-time jobs and saved all their money to pay for your surgery.

466
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,410
Police University Written Exam - Acceptance
We write to inform you that you passed the written exam for Police University.

467
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,450
We will reach out in the future regarding dates for the physical exam and interview.

468
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:35,210
Oh Kang Hui
I passed the first round for Police University. Second round, fighting!

469
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,220
Keep running. Run!

470
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,790
Okay, you pass.

471
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,800
Police University
002630

472
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,860
A person needs to sleep.

473
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,380
I... usually

474
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:20,090
I will catch those guys no matter what, whether I sleep or I die.

475
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,480
Mentor, you're off duty right now.

476
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,270
Exactly. That's why I need you to do something.

477
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,670
Me? Me?

478
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,620
I just got back to work today!

479
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,890
Hey! Those hackers,

480
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,460
the place they retrieved the money from is going to be connected to a bank account.

481
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,780
Submit documents to the bank to get the time for the transaction.

482
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,200
If they withdrew it, get the security camera footage. I'll give you one hour.

483
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,650
I mean, why are you trying to catch those bastards?

484
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,840
I need to ask them!

485
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,420
How they got through to that account so easily!

486
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,770
Before that, I'll lock them up first. Those criminal bastards.

487
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,920
- Give us another serving.
- Yes!
Home Cooked Food

488
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,120
Extra large wrap!

489
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,480
Father, open up.

490
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,590
Forget it, you eat it.

491
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,830
I ate a lot.

492
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,290
Okay, I'll eat it. So eat yourself.

493
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,740
What are you doing? You have to eat a lot after getting discharged from the hospital.

494
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,660
Here, open up.

495
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,660
I will feed myself, just go ahead.

496
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,190
It's so good.

497
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,570
Ah, I digest so quickly... I'm going to the bathroom.

498
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,290
- Excuse me, can we get a soju bottle, please?
- Okay.

499
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,110
You were discharged today. The doctor said you shouldn't drink.

500
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,810
It's not for me. It's for you to have one drink.

501
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,380
Here you go.

502
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,460
When I think of Seung Beom, my head hurts. When I think of you, my heart aches.

503
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,620
How could I treat you guys the same when I think of you two differently?

504
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:18,680
And you don't act the same way to me as Seung Beom does.

505
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,390
You don't whine or tell me if you want something or do anything.

506
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,800
You didn't even ask me to come to your college counseling meeting.

507
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,170
I spoke with your teacher. I heard you decided to go to the National Police University.

508
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:37,440
I'm really happy that you have something you want to do

509
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,960
and you're going for it.

510
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,790
Maybe the cancer cells went away

511
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,550
because I am so happy.

512
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,400
You don't— You don't even let me have soju!

513
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,810
Just give me one glass, huh?

514
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,240
- Please give me some soju.
- You brat.

515
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,700
Who the hell do you take after?

516
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,530
Thank you. Thank you.

517
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,870
Did you drink any?

518
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,300
I had one glass.

519
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,590
What are you doing here, Detective?

520
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,480
Well, it's...

521
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,380
So, you did this because of your father's hospital bills?

522
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,650
This started because that man caused the accident in the first place.

523
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,140
Just let us go.

524
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,590
We also let the accident go.

525
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,090
Hey, you punk! Are those two the same thing?

526
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,810
Then, what do you want us to do?

527
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,080
Would you have just sat still?

528
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,570
Be honest, is there a way to make $7000 overnight?

529
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,490
Even if there is no other way,

530
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,150
who said you could steal?

531
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,600
Is it a crime to steal from bad people?

532
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:13,220
Shouldn't you be after the guys who ran the illegal gambling site, and not us?

533
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,350
We'll lock you guys up first,

534
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,750
then we'll also catch those guys, and put you in the same cell.

535
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,040
Don't worry about that.

536
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,590
Move.

537
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,480
What's your name?

538
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,150
Your name?

539
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,890
Kang Seon Ho. Yun Seung Beom.

540
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,350
What are your last names different?

541
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:44,110
That's personal. Besides, is that important right now?

542
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,800
What's your age?

543
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,830
19 years old.

544
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,180
Your profession is a troubled high school student.

545
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:53,220
- Address?
- 37-1 Namyang-dong, Jongro-gu, Seoul.

546
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,620
- What about you?
- Can't you tell that we live together?

547
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,270
You—

548
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,490
The charge is violation of the telecommunications law.

549
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,860
Detective Park, for this crime it's three years in prison, right?

550
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,140
Yes.

551
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,170
When your friends are having fun going to college,

552
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,500
you guys will be stuck in your depressing prison cells

553
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,140
for stealing money from some bad guys.

554
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,010
In the future, whether it's a job, a dream, or your life,

555
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:25,980
only the red light will be on, and you'll live a life that stops. Oh!

556
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,070
Did you just hear that?

557
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:31,230
The sound of lives being doomed.

558
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,520
These idiot bastards.

559
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,790
Hand this over to the prosecution.

560
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,210
Mr. Yun.

561
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,190
Please, save them once.

562
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,430
Their future is still unknown and they're so young.

563
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:23,620
Detectives, I beg you.

564
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,950
Please let them go this once.

565
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,520
Dad, get up.

566
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,300
I said, get up!

567
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,570
Please, I beg you.

568
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,500
Please.

569
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,060
Get up.

570
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,290
Look at that. Look at the cost of you guys living without fear like this.

571
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,990
- Stop it.
- Don't you ever forget

572
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,190
that you have to take responsibility for your decisions.

573
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:16,670
I said that's enough!

574
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:21,340
You bastard!

575
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,590
You hate this, don't you, you punk?

576
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:31,780
But just because you're poor and things are tough, and you didn't have any other choice,

577
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,710
do you think the law will just let you guys go?

578
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:40,670
You can't even repay him for raising you. You pathetic bastards.

579
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,910
You're not supposed to protect your sons' lives with your knees.

580
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,260
They should protect it with their own knees.

581
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,340
From now on, let them do it on their own.

582
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,920
Thank you.

583
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,390
I'm grateful.

584
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,380
Okay.

585
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,290
Are you really doing this?

586
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:39,970
That's how those damn punks will live the rest of their lives, taking care of their dad's knees.

587
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,210
You guys, don't ever appear in front of me again.

588
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:50,710
If we meet again, then I will show what's really unfair.

589
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,140
Mentor, if you do this, you can't come back to work in Seoul.

590
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,810
You really will have to be transferred somewhere else!

591
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,710
Stop

592
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:48,190
Police University Written Exam - Acceptance. Announcement of Physical Exam and Interview

593
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,810
Delete?

594
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,610
Delete?

595
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,590
Let's just enlist together.

596
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,270
Okay.

597
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:14,760
Yoon Digital

598
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,450
Get in.

599
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,880
Seung Beom isn't out yet—

600
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,160
Where are we going?

601
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,650
Yes, Hyungnim.

602
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:56,230
Whether it rains or snows, you never close. What's going on?

603
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:00,730
I'm taking my son to his interview.

604
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,150
His interview?

605
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,000
Hyungnim, you've heard of the National Police University, right?

606
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,480
National Police University?!

607
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,840
Isn't that school impossible to get into?

608
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,900
So you know.

609
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,970
There is just a small interview left. You might as well say he has passed it.

610
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:19,740
You must be happy!

611
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,290
Of course, I'm happy.

612
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:26,080
My son, Seon Ho, said he really wants to become a cop.

613
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,070
Mr. Yun must be really happy!

614
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,700
I'm really happy.

615
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,970
I'm very proud.

616
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,740
I will buy you a drink sometime.

617
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,960
I'll talk to you later, bye.

618
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,450
I'm sorry.

619
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,950
Reflect on your mistake and

620
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:57,320
study hard from now on to pay back for your mistake.

621
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:05,730
So, it's the first time you ever wanted to be something, become a police officer.

622
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,860
That will make up for me being on my knees.

623
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,960
We're settled, right?

624
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:15,940
Yes.

625
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,200
Hey, hurry up and eat.

626
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,870
Would you be able to answer anything on an empty stomach?

627
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:31,080

Venue: National Police University Auditorium
Date: October 25, 2020

629
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,720
My son, Seon Ho, said he really wants to become a cop.

630
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,760
I'm really happy.

631
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,940
I'm very proud.

632
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,250
Become a police officer.

633
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,890
Ajhu—

634
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,700
Father!

635
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:13,860
I will make sure to pass!

636
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:20,460
I will pass and become a police officer!

637
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,920
Okay! Hurry up and go in!

638
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,370
Of course, you will pass. Whose son are you?

639
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,310
My grandfather...

640
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,440
Kang Seon Ho

641
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:18,310
Starting now, we'll begin the final interview of the freshmen, for the 41st Police University entrance.

642
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:21,050
Do not make any noise or small talk.

643
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:24,700
Be sure to sit up straight until the end.

644
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,610
As soon as your name is called, answer loudly and stand up.

645
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:29,740
Do you understand?

646
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,260
- Yes...
- Yes.
- No.

647
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,960
Do you understand?

648
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,200
Yes!

649
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,200
Good luck.

650
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,790
I applied here to learn crime scene investigation first.

651
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:08,690
Are you planning on entering law school later?

652
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,180
I'm also considering that.

653
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:17,370
It will be nice to have a smart guy like you on our police force.

654
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:20,920
It would be nice if you change your mind while attending the university.

655
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,570
Yes, I also want to do that.

656
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,570
Overall Review and Assessment

657
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,620
Excellent - A

658
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,170
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

659
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:47,350
It's because I'm so nervous. This is a way to relax.

660
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:52,870
This is my third time, so if I fail this time too, then I can't apply again.

661
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:56,010
You can call me No Beom Tae.

662
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,170
I'm Kang Seon Ho.

663
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,450
I'm Jo Jun Wuk.

664
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,800
It's nice to meet you, bros.

665
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,330
- Nice to meet you.
- Your sweat...

666
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:08,930
Student number 002618, No Beom Tae.

667
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,580
Yes!

668
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,810
Candidate. Are you not going to answer?

669
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:18,790
That... I... I...

670
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:19,610
Interviewer

671
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:22,070
Okay, relax.

672
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:24,270
Drink some water too.

673
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,670
Thank you.

674
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,420
He's very nervous.

675
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,570
That is... my grandfather...

676
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,140
was the head of a small village.

677
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:43,760
Seeing him work for the citizens,

678
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,720
I wanted to set an example as well!

679
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,710
That is why I really...

680
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,530
I really...

681
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:54,540
I really...

682
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,590
- want to
- want to

683
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:56,490
be a good cop.

684
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:58,510
- be a good cop.
- be a good cop.

685
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,120
A+

686
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,020
Good - B+ / Good - B+ / Perfect - A+

687
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:13,990
You were also in front of the academy, right?

688
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:17,500
- What?
- Did you follow me here to this school?

689
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:24,500
No. It's my dream too to become a cop.

690
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:32,430
Student number 002623, Oh Kang Hui.

691
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:33,820
Yes!

692
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,650
Excuse me!

693
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,690
Good luck.

694
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:50,470
Did you know that the first undercover officer

695
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,960
was a thief?

696
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,910
During a time of a lot of thefts,

697
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:59,290
the French police hired reformed thieves because they said thieves know each other the best.

698
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:02,110
After this, the crime rate dropped 68% and

699
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,650
the second offense rate dropped 20%.

700
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:07,910
It became a new world when a thief became a police officer.

701
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:11,060
I will learn to be a police person with a mindset of a thief.

702
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,740
I will learn from the office with a mindset of a victim.

703
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,690
Overall Review and Assessment

704
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,410
Perfect - A+

705
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:24,510
Student number 002630, Kang Seon Ho.

706
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:26,200
Yes!

707
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,190
Hello.

708
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:52,500
I am, student number 002630, Kang Seon Ho.

709
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:10,070
Don't ever appear in front of me again.

710
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:16,510
If we meet again, then I will show what's really unfair.

711
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,050
I told you.

712
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:26,700
In the future, whether it's a job, a dream, or your life, only the red light will turn on,

713
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,490
and you'll live a life that stops.

714
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,330
You want to go to the National Police University?

715
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:34,400
You can't get in, you punk.

716
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,200
Get out.

717
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:38,410
Didn't you hear me?

718
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:41,790
I said, you're out!

719
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,740
♫ Fly away towards tomorrow now, ♫

720
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:53,390
♫ fly away high to the end. ♫

721
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,680
♫ The hot sun is not in the sky there. ♫

722
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,400
♫ I found it (I found it) ♫

723
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,380
♫ in my heart (in my heart) ♫

724
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,310
♫ Challenging ourselves every day, we're gonna burn it up. ♫

725
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:08,660
♫ There's nothing we can't get through together. ♫

726
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,390
♫ We're not stopping. Never stop. ♫

727
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,640
♫ Shout it out. ♫

728
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,150
Police University

729
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,170
- Admitted?
- Please "admitted"!

730
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:18,870
I passed! It's real!

731
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:20,170
Who was that girl earlier?

732
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,640
She was pretty and looked nice.

733
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,100
I will hold your suitcase for you.

734
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,450
- You are freshmen at National Police University, right?
 - Yes.

735
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:28,300
You can't come to this school, you punk.

736
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,050
Let's get through training

737
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,480
and reach the final admission step.

738
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,950
You can be dropped out from here, too?

739
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:33,860
Get down for a push up.

740
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,760
If you get on the bad side of the training teacher, they say you will leave within two days.

741
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,070
Can't you let it go thinking a young guy made a mistake once?

742
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,660
It's not your first mistake.

743
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,450
It's not your first mistake, you bastard!
