1
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,062
Are you feeling better now?

2
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,149
Yes.

3
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,817
You must've been startled.

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,738
Of all days for this to happen…

5
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,783
-What was that call about?
-Excuse me?

6
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,828
You didn't look too great
after getting that call.

7
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,664
Oh, that.

8
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,501
It wasn't anything serious.

9
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,003
It happens often, but…

10
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:32,884
Jeez.

11
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,137
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

12
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,685
A while back…

13
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,439
Never mind.

14
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:46,732
What about a while back?

15
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,071
Anyway, what did you want to
tell me today?

16
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,282
You never got to say it.

17
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,035
Oh, it wasn't anything important.

18
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,121
I just called to have tea with you.

19
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,335
You just wanted to have tea with me?

20
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,378
Yes.

21
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,634
You have something to say.

22
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:14,802
No, I don't.

23
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,059
I said I don't. What's wrong with you?

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,477
Come on.

25
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,063
What is it about?

26
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:27,898
Tell me.

27
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,651
What was it?

28
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,072
EPISODE 13

29
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,621
Oh, man.

30
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,625
-Mother.
-Jae-hyeong!

31
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,753
What's going on?
What happened to your face?

32
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:50,838
Who did this to you?

33
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,756
Over there.

34
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,678
What?

35
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,929
Hyeon-jun.

36
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,681
Look at your face.

37
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,725
What's going on? What happened?

38
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,894
-Jeez, just go and check on her.
-Huh?

39
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,270
Just go already.

40
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,400
Here you go, Mother.

41
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:12,776
Wipe your tears.

42
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,489
Hello?

43
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,490
Mr. Hwang.

44
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,826
Sorry, just a minute.

45
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,000
Me? Why?

46
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,085
Director.

47
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,588
I'm not shooting with her.

48
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,550
When that article about her came out,
I was utterly humiliated.

49
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,177
But I let it go because I'm an actress.

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,263
Even when we crossed paths
doing the same drama,

51
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:42,890
I just accepted it.

52
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,309
But you can't expect even someone like me

53
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,645
to let it slide a second time, right?

54
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,689
It's just how things go on a set.

55
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,275
There's always some tension and conflict.

56
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,945
But we need to compromise
for the good of the show--

57
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,113
I'm disappointed in you, too, Director.

58
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,658
All I did was give it my best in acting.

59
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,619
Mi-ran is the one who can't tell
reality from acting.

60
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,329
-That was acting?
-What else would it be?

61
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,581
You slapped me as hard as you could,
with every bit of emotion!

62
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,041
I never…

63
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,669
-Director.
-Yes?

64
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,253
I'm the one who's disappointed.

65
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,756
I don't care if the lead actor
asked you for this favor.

66
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,050
You can't treat casting
like some package deal.

67
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,176
A package deal?

68
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,136
That's not it at all, ma'am!

69
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,973
Mr. Lim never asked
such a favor to begin with,

70
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,393
and I've always been a big fan
of Ms. Seong's movies.

71
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,729
So I'd been wanting
a chance to work with her.

72
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,357
-Did you hear that?
-So now what?

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,483
Should I drop out, then?

74
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,193
Ms. Oh, please…

75
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,444
Mother.

76
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,664
Mom, just apologize.

77
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,875
Why are you telling me to apologize?
I was just acting.

78
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,003
Then why is Ms. Oh so upset?

79
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,463
She's just jealous
of my superb acting skills.

80
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,550
She'd have no reason to feel that way.

81
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,260
The script only said one slap,

82
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:05,014
but you got excited at the opportunity
and slapped her twice!

83
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,809
It's true that I can't stand Oh Mi-ran,
but I'm an actress myself.

84
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,352
I was just doing my job.

85
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,399
All right, fine.
Just apologize to her first, okay?

86
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,316
No.

87
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,527
Will you quit, then?

88
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,947
She claims you slapped her with emotion.
You won't win this fight!

89
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,241
Stop making this worse and just apologize.

90
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,452
Why should I apologize?

91
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,203
Because you got this role, thanks to me.

92
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,164
I basically got you the role.

93
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,541
Do it for me and just apologize.

94
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,168
I said I don't want to!

95
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,920
Why should I apologize
when I did nothing wrong?

96
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,061
Let's wrap it up for the day.

97
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,562
Excuse me?

98
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,023
Okay, sir.

99
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,235

EDITORIAL DESK

101
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,450
I'm heading out.

102
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,786
-Goodbye.
-Have a good night.

103
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,787
Let's see here.

104
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,003
It wasn't anything serious.

105
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,797
It happens often, but…

106
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,758
It happened again today.

PANIC DISORDER

108
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,643
WHAT IS A PANIC DISORDER?

109
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,019
A TYPE OF ANXIETY DISORDER
CAUSING SUDDEN, INTENSE FEAR.

110
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,650
SYMPTOMS USUALLY PEAK WITHIN 10 MINUTES.

111
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,527
-Panic disorder?
-You scared me.

112
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,322
It's nothing.
I was just doing some research.

113
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,324
What's with the face?

114
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,369
What about it?

115
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,956
You look like a guy dumped you.

116
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,916
Nobody dumped me.

117
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,379
Chief.

118
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,338
By the way…

119
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,718
What you said about
celebrity and non-celebrity couples

120
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,178
always ending in disaster…

121
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,888
Do you really believe that?

122
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,850
Why? Is someone dating a celebrity?

123
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,017
No, well…

124
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,520
It's my friend.

125
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,858
I don't think
they're officially dating yet,

126
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,693
but the guy lied to her.

127
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,819
About what?

128
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,737
He lied about being a celebrity.

129
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,323
How could he not tell her
something so important?

130
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,868
Imagine how betrayed she must feel.

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,246
So?

132
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,081
She's not going to see him?

133
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:37,832
I don't know.

134
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,921
Well, even if I were dating him,

135
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,340
the thought of being publicly dismissed

136
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,593
and being kept in the shadows

137
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,553
makes me shrink back.

138
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,472
Shrink back? That's not like you.

139
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,975
I didn't get it at first either,

140
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,936
but now that I've gone through it,
I get it now.

141
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,776
You're so pathetic.

142
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,612
You should a write a book
on being pathetic.

143
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,530
You'd sell millions of copies.

144
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:11,783
Pathetic?

145
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,077
Oh, wait.

146
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,746
I was talking about my friend, not me!

147
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,164
Don't get me wrong, Chief!

148
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,416
-It's my friend!
-I didn't say anything.

149
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,128
Damn it.

150
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,138
Oh man, what a day.

151
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,313
Seriously.

152
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,153
Who's calling?

153
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,321
CHIEF YUN HWA-YEONG, SPORTS EUNSEONG

154
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,280
What?

155
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,161
Hello, Ms. Yun.

156
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,288
Why do you sound so exhausted?

157
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,289
Well, my mom…

158
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:05,379
No, never mind. I'm just tired.

159
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,923
Anyway, why did you call?

160
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,175
Can we meet up right now?

161
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,260
Excuse me?

162
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,552
Right now?

163
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,720
At this hour?

164
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,146
Why would you call me out at this hour?

165
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,481
I'm exhausted.

166
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,692
I'm busy myself, you know.

167
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,195
-I'm not here to chat.
-Of course you're not.

168
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,281
So what's this about?

169
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,993
Are things going well
between you and Wi Jeong-sin?

170
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,160
Yes, of course.

171
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,870
We even met up today, but…

172
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,915
Something came up today,

173
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,585
so we didn't really get a chance to talk.

174
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,505
You need to step it up.
Things don't look good right now.

175
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,633
-They don't look good?
-No.

176
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,845
You might not get the answer
you're looking from her.

177
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,055
I suggest that you prepare for the worst.

178
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:03,562
But I thought things were going well
between her and me lately.

179
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,897
Mr. Lim, you and Wi Jeong-sin

180
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,525
come from two completely different worlds.

181
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,695
Different worlds, my ass.
We both live in Seoul.

182
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,489
What I'm saying is

183
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,743
that if you came from an outer planet,

184
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,661
Wi Jeong-sin is someone from Earth.

185
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,789
If you're an airplane
used to soaring above the clouds,

186
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:27,377
Wi Jeong-sin is someone
who's used to walking on solid ground.

187
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,088
I'm not saying you're better than her.

188
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,507
I'm just saying
that's how wide the mental gap is

189
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,967
between a top star and a non-celebrity.

190
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,595
Jeez, I'm not a top star.

191
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,764
I'm just a regular person.

192
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:39,890
So what are you saying?

193
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,142
Should I match her pace
and take things slowly?

194
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,477
So she won't feel pressured?

195
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,356
No, just the opposite.
You need to give her reassurance.

196
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,567
Don't hide your feelings.
Tell her repeatedly that you like her.

197
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,985
Just keep telling her that.

198
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,280
Jeez, you want me to
tell her again and again?

199
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,240
Are you saying I should brainwash her?

200
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,993
Besides, do you really think
that'll work on her?

201
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,037
Come on, how is that…

202
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,207
How is that brainwashing her?

203
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,835
All I said was to be honest
about your feelings.

204
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,004
This is so frustrating.

205
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,757
Do I really have to teach you everything?

206
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,011
Are you saying I should
confess my love to her on my knees, then?

207
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,138
"Will you please make up your mind
and go out with me?"

208
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,182
Do you want me to beg like that?

209
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,393
Jeez.

210
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,607
Is that what it'll take?

211

Our company's

217
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,193
Yes.

218
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,490
Even though you're a reporter
and we know each other,

219
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:24,161
I can't show you those
because of our internal policies.

220
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,704
I know it's a big ask,

221
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,332
but if this continues,
King's Back will be at risk.

222
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,500
What do you mean?

223
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,549
All right, I'll think about it.

224
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,384
Ms. Wi!

225
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,222
What brings you here today?

226
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,474
You didn't say you were coming.

227
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,518
I came to talk about yesterday.

228
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,564
I just had something
to discuss with Mr. Hwang.

229
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,860
What could you two possibly have
to talk about without me?

230
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,571
Just something.

231
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,449
I'll leave you two to it, then.

232
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,909
No, wait a minute.

233
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,452
You're leaving already?

234
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,370
Yes. I'm done here, so I should go.

235
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,080
But I just got here.

Oh, look. The scripts for Kang Pil-gu 5.

238
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,805
It's all right here.

239
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,602
Episodes seven and eight are great,
don't you think?

240
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,646
-Episodes seven and eight.
-Bro.

00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,574
Do you want to take a look?

243
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,535
Wait…

244
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,789
Gosh, would you look at this?

245
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,040
You said you have a meeting.

246
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,961
Are you sure it's okay
to let a reporter see the scripts?

247
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,462
I'll take care of it.

248
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,463
-Go on.
-Okay, fine.

249
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,382
-Stop pushing me.
-All right.

250
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,551
-I got it.
-Jeez.

251
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,396
Please sit over there.

252
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,313
Huh?

253
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,816
-Why?
-Here.

254
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,110
Well…

255
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,988
I'll let you have a read,

256
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,283
but you can't take them
because of security reasons.

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,703
So you'll have to
read the whole thing here.

258
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,164
But it'll take me
hours to get through them.

259
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,208
That's fine with me.

260
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,543
Take your time.

261
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,151
Why are you sitting here?
Don't you have to go?

262
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,193
Well, I…

263
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,280
I have to watch you,

264
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,866
in case you take photos of the script.

265
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,244
I'm not that unethical of a reporter.

266
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,164
I'm just saying.

267
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,541
Don't mind me. Go ahead and read.

268
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,753
Would you like some coffee or cookies?

269
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,004
No, thank you.

270
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,484
You need to step it up.

271
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,486
Things don't look good right now.

272
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,031
If you're an airplane
used to soaring above the clouds,

273
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:52,077
Wi Jeong-sin is someone
who's used to walking on solid ground.

274
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,208
You know, as far as people's lives go,

275
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,836
they may seem completely different.

276
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,215
But when you look closely,
they're all the same.

277
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:09,552
It's all the same,
even for actors and top celebrities.

278
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,512
Therefore,

279
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,056
I'm just an ordinary guy too.

280
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,475
Right.

281
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,061
You could say
you're not exactly ordinary either.

282
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,145
You went to Hankuk University.

283
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,983
What does graduating from there
have to do with being ordinary?

284
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,654
Graduating from Hankuk University
puts you among the top 0.1% of minds,

285
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,572
and that's far from ordinary.

286
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,282
It means you're a genius.

287
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,243
I'm just a high school grad.

288
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,287
I mean, a college dropout.

289
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,373
I didn't ask you any of that.

290
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,252
What I'm saying is…

291
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,925
It's easy to be fooled
by my outstanding traits,

292
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:50,844
but the truth is,

293
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,888
I have a lot of shortcomings too.

294
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,141
I'm well aware of your shortcomings.

295
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,775
By the way,

296
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,819
why did you ask to see me that day?

297
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,034
Well, that was…

298
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:18,997
Was it to tell me…

299
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,209
that you never wanted to see me again?

300
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,547
"We come from
completely different worlds."

301
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,383
"We're not right for each other."

302
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,178
Were you going to quote a line
like some '90s drama?

303
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,606
Was that it?

304
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,152
Then why didn't you say it?

305
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,824
Because you seemed shaken
at the cafe that day.

306
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,162
I was okay, thanks to you.

307
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,958
I was fine
when we sat on the bench outside,

308
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:05,710
which means

309
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,254
you could've told me then.

310
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,673
So why didn't you?

311
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,011
Maybe when you saw me,

312
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,180
you couldn't bring yourself to say…

313
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,142
that you didn't want to see me.

314
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,709
Really listen to your heart
and think about it.

315
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,628
Ask yourself what it is

316
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:50,713
that you really want.

317
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,427
Take your time reading.

and I'll take care of the business.

321
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,919
Let's turn the agency into
a comprehensive entertainment company.

322
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,629
People call Mr. Lee Dae-ho a media mogul,

323
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,507
but his newspapers make no profit
and are essentially empty shells.

324
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:38,011
Do you even know where
the investment funds are coming from?

325
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,141
I don't think I should sign this.

326
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,144
Isn't this something you sign
when selling a company?

327
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,730
It's just a formality,
so it's fine for you to sign it.

328
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:50,899
I see.

00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,737
But if this continues,
King's Back will be at risk.

331
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,157
I don't think
I can sign this without reviewing.

332
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:04,454
I'll discuss the matter with the others
before I sign it.

Thanks.

338
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,079
For what?

339
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,457
For holding the elevator for me.

340
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,504
-Are you free tomorrow morning?
-No.

341
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:56,839
Why?

342
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,633
I was wondering
if you could take my son to kindergarten.

343
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,595
-Me?
-Dads come to read to the kids.

344
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,888
It's my son's turn tomorrow,

345
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,057
so I was hoping you could fill in.

00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,178
so get ready.

354
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,513
Yes, sir.

355
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:49,767
And what should we do
about CEO Hwang of King's Back?

356
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:50,977
He's being really difficult.

357
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,438
Call a board meeting.

358
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,692
Tell them the agenda is about
the CEO's dismissal.

359
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,360
Yes, sir.

360
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,112
As quickly as possible.

361
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,407
Hey, Kang Pil-gu! Get it together!

362
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,325
That jerk hit me first!

363
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,744
It's not just me.

364
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,788
He bullies and swears at other kids too.

365
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,207
I was just trying to stop him

366
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,917
from taking their money.

367
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,836
Detective,

368
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,921
why are you taking his word over mine?

369
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,007
Cut.

370
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,218
Let's take a ten-minute break.

371
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,763
We'll take a ten-minute break.

372
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,433
Let's go.

373
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,607
You're doing another take, right?

374
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,275
Will that improve his acting?

375
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,070
I told you not to cast him!

376
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,323
This won't work.

377
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,158
Why don't you rehearse with him?

378
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,451
-Me?
-Yes.

379
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,245
-Seon-u.
-Yeah?

380
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:52,371
You're doing well.

381
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,165
-I am?
-Yeah, you are.

382
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,666
But let's just…

383
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,752
-Relax your muscles a bit.
-Relax?

384
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,295
-Yeah, and…
-Yeah?

385
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,256
-Relax your muscles here.
-Okay.

386
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,592
-And right here.
-Okay.

387
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,552
You need to relax your hands too.

388
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:07,887
-Okay, I got it.
-Good.

389
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,306
Relax.

390
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,599
Relax.

391
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,060
Okay, now let's start over.

392
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,686
All right, give it a try.

393
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,690
"Hey, Kang Pil-gu. Get it together!"

394
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,234
That jerk hit me first!

395
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,238
-Seon-u, let's relax your muscles more.
-More?

396
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,864
-Yes, right here.
-Okay.

397
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:27,782
Action!

398
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,075
KEY DISTRIBUTOR HAN SEOK-HO & NETWORK

399
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,410
This is our primary suspect,

400
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,578
Han Seok-ho.

401
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,583
On the surface,
he appears to run local clubs,

402
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,751
but in reality,

403
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:43,089
he's the key distributor
of a new synthetic drug called Nebula.

404
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,258
He took control of the nightlife district

405
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,968
-and illicit cash flows,
-Stay still.

406
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,304
-and established a distribution network.
-Stay still.

407
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,724
Our objective is clear.

408
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,601
Han Seok-ho's--

409
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:58,229
-Cut!
-Cut!

410
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,439
Okay.

411
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,988
Let's take a quick break.

412
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,489
Thank you.

413
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,659
What is it?

414
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,037
Mr. Lim.

415
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:20,126
This is the scene where
Pil-gu falls for RIU officer Gwon Se-na

416
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,795
as she delivers a brilliant briefing.

417
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,339
Is that how people act
when they fall for someone?

418
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,340
You looked so distracted.

419
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,134
I don't agree with you.

420
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,762
Viewers these days
focus a lot on plausibility.

421
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:35,516
Pil-gu only just gave up his crush
on the owner of the flower shop.

422
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,144
But he falls for this woman
just because she's good at briefing?

423
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,605
Pil-gu doesn't fall for just anyone.

424
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,148
This is totally out of character!

425
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,109
He gave up on the florist
because she was married with a kid!

426
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,235
Why would he still be hung up on her?

427
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,320
That's even weirder!

428
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,321
You've never dated, have you?

429
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,866
That's not how relationships work.

430
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:54,076
Mr. Lim.

431
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,872
You promised to do the romantic scenes
with Ms. Gwon Se-na.

432
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,165
Should I play the recording?

433
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,336
You jerk.

434
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,296
We'll continue shooting, then.

435
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,673
You know the next scene, right?

436
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,346
It's too dangerous out in the field!

437
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,933
There are too many
crazy bastards out there!

438
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,478
So just conduct the investigation,
and stay away from the scene.

439
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,525
Are you worried about me?

440
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,153
I wouldn't say that.

441
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,488
Then what is it?

442
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,498
Cut. Bad take. Let's go again.

443
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,500
It's too dangerous out in the field!

444
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,044
There are too many
crazy bastards out there!

445
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,798
So just conduct the investigation,
and stay away from the scene.

446
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,055
Are you worried about me?

447
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,267
I wouldn't say that.

448
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,519
Then what is it?

449
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,321
Cut!

450
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,614
Bad take. Let's go again.

451
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,201
Cut.

452
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,494
Cut.

453
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,954
Cut.

454
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,253
-This is so annoying.
-Cut!

455
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,340
It just came out.

456
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,762
If you keep turning away like that,
we can't get a good shot.

457
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,348
I didn't do it on purpose.

458
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,850
Do you want to watch it together?

459
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,477
No, there's no need for that. I'm fine.

460
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,813
Pil-gu is supposed to
freeze in place as he's kissed.

461
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,606
If you keep avoiding her,

462
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,151
how is she supposed to kiss you?

463
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:54,071
How about ending the scene
after she pushes me against the wall?

464
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,532
They're at work,
so they shouldn't take it too far.

465
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,201
Okay, then.

466
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,955
Then Ms. Gwon will just…

467
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,625
She'll push you against the wall
and when she gets close--

468
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,961
-Cut.
-Cut.

469
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,379
I'll call cut.

470
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:12,882
That's okay, right?

471
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,301
Yes, that's fine.

472
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,302
Okay.

473
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:25,853
Man, another sneeze.

474
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,067
NURI FOREST KINDERGARTEN

475
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,110
Thanks for coming today.

476
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,281
Why did you ask me, of all people?

477
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:40,618
My son asked me to bring a handsome uncle.

478
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:44,163
But nobody else looked
as good to me as you did, Mr. Lee.

479
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:48,876
Jeez.

480
00:27:56,467 --> 00:28:00,262
"I run because
I love your beautiful smile."

481
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:04,558
"I run towards the school bus
that waits for us every morning."

482
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:10,606
"I run as fast as I can
when I hear you're hurt."

483
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,323
"Even now, Mommy's still running."

484
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,618
-"I'm running to get you."
-Hello.

485
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,955
"Because I don't want to hurt your heart."

486
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,546
Jae-ha.

487
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,381
Mom!

488
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,967
-"You just need to stay right there."
-I'm here, Jae-ha.

489
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,051
Were you having fun?

490
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:40,553
"And know that Mommy…"

491
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,597
"…will always run to you."

492
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,947
This part is the weirdest. Seriously.

493
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,200
How much longer do I have to wait?

494
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,743
When will we resume shooting?

495
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,996
The lighting crew is still setting up.

496
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:08,873
Yes?

497
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,591
I'll go check the schedule.

498
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,301
Hey, you can't leave.

499
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:25,556
What is it?

500
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,642
Are you going to keep this up?

501
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,145
-What do you mean?
-Get it together.

502
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,272
-What?
-You clearly have the wrong idea.

503
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,483
Kang Pil-gu isn't just your show.

504
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,444
Every project I take on
is important to me too.

505
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,780
Our past is just between the two of us.

506
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,242
How am I supposed to work with you
when you're being so childish?

507
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,202
"Childish"?

508
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:47,828
"Our past"?

509
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,956
Wow, unbelievable.

510
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,043
That's what you think of me?

511
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,671
I'm frustrated because the plot
keeps going off track.

512
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:01,217
Also, I don't need
your feedback on my acting.

513
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,803
Based on the antics I saw,
I'd say you need some.

514
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:05,888
"Antics"?

515
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,644
You said you still had
feelings for me, right?

516
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,022
Yeah.

517
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:15,981
There's someone

518
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:18,692
I like.

519
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,904
I'm seeing someone.

520
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,504
Jeez, you've got to be kidding me.

521
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,715
Are they going to
keep everyone waiting for hours?

522
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,967
-Hey, Gil-su.
-Yes?

523
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,594
Go ask when they'll resume shooting.

524
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:48,013
I've already asked three times.

525
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,598
They're not done prepping.

526
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,016
What is there to prepare?

527
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,143
He's revising the script
right now, isn't he?

528
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,646
I told him from the start

529
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,064
that dramas are different from movies,

530
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,984
and that it'd be hard to direct and write
at the same time.

531
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,652
I told him not to take on too much.

532
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,363
Whatever.

533
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,199
I'll just have to…

534
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,118
I'll just…

535
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,662
Grab our stuff. We're leaving.

536
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,127
Wait, you're not really leaving, are you?

537
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,879
-What?
-Is he leaving?

538
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:26,468
LIM HYEON-JUN

539
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,142
Did he really leave?

540
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:35,644
Seriously?

541
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:50,701
There are only a few of these cars
in the country, right?

542
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:52,995
Probably.

543
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,041
Bro.

544
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,335
I haven't been in it yet either.

545
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:01,420
Are you sure this is okay?

546
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,465
I hear the whole set was in chaos
after you left.

547
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,634
Is this really the time
to be rehearsing the script?

548
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,719
I know what I'm doing.

549
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:11,597
Byeong-gi needs some time right now.

550
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,558
You guys must be hungry.

551
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:16,644
-Yeah.
-Yes.

552
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:17,561
Okay.

553
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,234
Can you hand me a paper towel?

554
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,694
Yes, sir.

555
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,531
POWER OUTAGE NOTICE

556
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,908
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

557
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,203
Hyeon-jun just steamed
dumplings for us, right?

558
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,205
Us?

559
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,249
Sure, let's say he did.

560
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,338
Here you go, some delicious dumplings.

561
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,509
I can't believe you personally steamed
dumplings for us.

562
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,553
-There's plenty more, so dig in.
-Yes, sir.

563
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,681
Thank you, Mr. Lim.

564
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:54,848
Try it.

565
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,313
It's so good.

566
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,149
-Really?
-Yeah.

567
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,072
It's really good!

568
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,031
Mr. Hwang, try some!

569
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:13,659
Gosh, stop exaggerating.

570
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,744
All dumplings taste the same.

571
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,246
"It's really good," my foot.

572
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,252
The juices just explode in my mouth!

573
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,132
Want to listen to something fun
while we eat?

574
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,718
You're not going to make Su-ji
tell a weird joke, are you?

575
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,138
Su-ji? Do you mean the actress?

576
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,014
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

577
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,474
Tell us a funny joke.

578
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,269
Okay. Here's the funny joke you requested.

579
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,271
What do you call fast food that takes off?

580
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,649
French fly!

581
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,576
Did you hear that? She said "french fly."

582
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,958
Right, "french fly."

583
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,793
Don't laugh.
He'll think it's actually funny.

584
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:05,794
Right, Mr…

585
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,757
I thought she meant "fly," like this.

586
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,344
"French fly" is so funny.

587
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:17,097
Wow, that was absolutely hilarious.

588
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:18,014
Mr. Lim.

589
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,185
You invited me to rehearse the script

590
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,021
and even steamed
delicious dumplings for me.

591
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,065
-It's such an honor, sir.
-Come on.

592
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,569
Honor? It's no big deal.

593
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,362
Should I ask my sister

594
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,783
to write a nice article about you?

595
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,702
No, don't do that.

596
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,580
I'm not the kind of guy
who asks for favors like that.

597
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:48,795
By the way,

598
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:50,797
does you sister know

599
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,761
that you came over to my house today?

600
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:04,311
KANG PIL-GU KISSES OR DOESN'T

601
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,479
KISSES OR DOESN'TTTTTT

602
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,069
I'll do whatever you write.

603
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,113
I'll follow the script
if you do me this favor.

604
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,549
KANG PIL-GU KISSES OR DOESN'T
KISSES OR DOESN'TTTTTT

605
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:34,842
Mr. Lim.

606
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,558
That color looks great on you.

607
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,934
-Really?
-Yeah.

608
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,687
-Hey, try this on, too.
-This too?

609
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,398
-Yes, take off the shirt.
-That's too many already.

610
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,191
Just try it on.

611
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,776
But this is yours.

612
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,236
Here we go.

613
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,655
Hey, this fits you perfectly.

614
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,073
It looks great.

615
00:35:58,699 --> 00:35:59,533
Take that too.

616
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,827
Hyeon-jun,
he'll clean you out at this rate.

617
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,078
Come on.

618
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,999
It's for Hong-sin. Jeez.

619
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,459
-Here, try on a suit.
-I really shouldn't…

620
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,671
Hey, Mr. Lim really likes me.

621
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,673
I know. What's wrong with him?

622
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,383
There must be a reason for this.

623
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,886
Right, so this one was expensive…

624
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,597
-Try this on.
-Yes, sir.

625
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,181
-Hey, bro.
-What?

626
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:24,558
How do I look?

627
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,935
-Mr. Hwang.
-Huh?

628
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,354
Leopard print and CEO don't mix.

629
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,274
Put it back before I kick you out.

630
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,822
-Here.
-Yes, sir.

631
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,912
This script reading room
is bigger than my house.

632
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,080
Watching Kang Pil-gu here
will blow your mind.

633
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,749
Bro, this is new.

634
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,083
Yeah, go ahead and try it out.

635
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,921
-It's about time you got this.
-These are expensive speakers.

636
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,422
-Wow, this feels great.
-This is crazy.

637
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,132
Man, this is awesome.

638
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,845
You like season four, right?

639
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:05,515
He has them all.

640
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,896
"A cop? How can someone like me
become a cop?"

641
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,898
"What do you mean by that?"

642
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,358
"You know what I mean."

643
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,778
"Without you, I'd have been expelled
and out there hurting people."

644
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:18,946
"So how can I be a cop?"

645
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:20,739
What do you think?

646
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,663
That was good. Nicely done.

647
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,122
You did a good job.

648
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:30,540
But first,

649
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,293
you need to connect with your character.

650
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:37,297
After that, you need to connect
with your partner's character.

651
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,841
Once those connections are established,

652
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:43,011
that's when the audience
will empathize with your performance.

653
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,137
-Got it?
-I see.

654
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,974
So for now,
you need to connect with each other.

655
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,600
Got it? Connecting.

656
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:49,893
"Connecting."

657
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,311
ACTING IS ABOUT CONNECTING AND EMPATHIZING

658
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:57,567
So because no one would cast him,

659
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:02,239
he wrote his own screenplay
and starred in it.

660
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,240
-Wow.
-I see.

661
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,866
And that's how Rocky was born.

662
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,787
Isn't that more moving
than the movie itself?

663
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,038
Yes, it is.

664
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,498
The moral of the story is,

665
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,458
if you want to achieve something,

666
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,253
don't stop until you get it.

667
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,504
Just like Rocky did.

668
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:19,881
Cheers.

669
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,217
You're right.

670
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,593
You're so right, Mr. Lim.

671
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,809
You're such a handsome
and amazing man, Mr. Lim.

672
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,354
How did I set you up on a blind date
with someone like my sister?

673
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:35,564
I'm so greatly

674
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,733
sorry about that.

675
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,192
Huh?

676
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:41,653
A blind date?

677
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:47,868
She went to Hankuk University
and works as a reporter.

678
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,752
I like you.

679
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,170
Excuse me?

680
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:00,839
I like you.

681
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:03,967
I like you.

682
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:04,968
Stop.

683
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,971
Stop. Be quiet.

684
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,935
Listen.

685
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:16,897
Listen, I…

686
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,315
Just shut up!

687
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,945
I like

688
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,697
Wi Jeong-sin.

689
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,201
I like Wi Jeong-sin!

690
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,244
Me!

691
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,245
Huh?

692
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:33,789
Excuse me?

693
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,708
Whatever, I give up.

694
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,879
Mr. Lim, did you just say

695
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,215
that you like my sister?

696
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,634
Yeah.

697
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,843
Dad!

698
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,637
Yes, my son?

699
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,097
Why did you call me?

700
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,515
-What do you need?
-Ask him for the soup.

701
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,600
-Oh, you want the rice cake soup?
-Here it comes.

702
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,686
Eat some rice cake soup, son.

703
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,022
-I'm here, Hyeon-jun!
-Come on in!

704
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,441
-Good to see you, brother-in-law.
-Hey.

705
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,401
Come on and have a seat.

706
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,403
See this galbi?

707
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:10,325
-Wow.
-Your sister spent all night making this.

708
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,160
-Eat up.
-Go ahead and dig in.

709
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,120
Hey!

710
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:15,914
Aren't you guys
getting ahead of yourselves?

711
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,210
Maybe we are.

712
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:21,711
Hey.

713
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:26,007
Could you do me a favor?

714
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,098
MY LITTLE BROTHER

715
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,184
Why are you calling me?
You should be home!

716
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:37,811
WI JEONG-SIN

717
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,063
Jeong-sin, I'm in pain.

718
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,148
What?

719
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,066
Is this a phone scam?

720
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,278
What's your clan origin?

721
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,779
The Jangheung Wi clan.

722
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:50,240
Go to a hospital if you're sick.
Why are you asking me to pick you up?

723
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,575
Oh, I…

724
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:55,370
Everyone's been drinking,
so no one can drive.

725
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,038
Then take a damn taxi!

726
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,541
Don't get so worked up.
You'll hurt your image.

727
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,084
What are you talking about?

728
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:03,044
Anyway, Jeong-sin,

729
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,383
I twisted my ankle so badly
that it hurts too much to get a taxi.

730
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,969
I can't move at all.

731
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,471
Damn it, you're so annoying.
Where are you?

732
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,682
At Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun's house.

733
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,560
What?

734
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,020
I'm home.

735
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,521
You're just getting in?

736
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:22,480
What were you doing?

737
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,275
I was looking through your photo album.

738
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,818
That's out of the blue.

739
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,571
You were so adorable back then.

740
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:32,324
Nice, you got grapes.

741
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:36,745
When you were little,
people used to say you looked like a doll.

742
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,997
-Jeez.
-Look at this.

743
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,790
-Look how cute you were.
-Wow.

744
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,042
How old was I?

745
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,217
Jae-ha!

746
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,260
Mom!

747
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,763
My precious son.

748
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,267
I brought an uncle. Say hello.

749
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,560
Hello.

750
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:02,145
Hello.

751
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,537
How badly is he hurt?

752
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,041
It's not bad, really.

753
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,252
Come in.

754
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:38,014
Did he even hurt his ankle?

755
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,977
No, he's not hurt.

756
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,938
We were rehearsing the script
when we got thirsty

757
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,232
and decided to have a beer.

758
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,527
I guess everyone was really tired
and they all crashed.

759
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,487
Well…

760
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,781
I'll wake up your brother,

761
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,950
so just rest in the study downstairs.

762
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:58,827
Or try out the massage chair.

763
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:30,483
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

764
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,256
Starting the massage chair.

765
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,520
Adjusting the massage chair position.

766
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,358
Oh, that feels great.

767
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,109
This is nice.

768
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:15,987
It's great, right?

769
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:19,949
Just stay there.

770
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,368
No, give me the remote.

771
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:23,244
Just stay there longer.

772
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:26,039
Hong-sin isn't awake yet,
so we have to wait anyway.

773
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,000
Well…

774
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:33,880
Thank you for that day.

775
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:36,508
When I had a panic attack.

776
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:40,303
I realized I never
properly thanked you that day.

777
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,555
I didn't really do anything.

778
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,644
Can you turn this off?
I'll wake Hong-sin up.

779
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,021
I said it was okay.

780
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,066
What the heck? Why did the lights go out?

781
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,402
-Did the power go out?
-I guess so.

782
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:58,113
What am I supposed to do? I'm stuck!

783
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,656
I'm done with the massage!

784
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,408
Come on, do something!

785
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:04,244
Just wait a little bit.
It'll come back on soon.

786
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,662
How long will it take?

787
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,288
Just relax.

788
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,918
And listen to what I have to say.

789
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,297
Did you listen to your heart
and really think about it?

790
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,591
Well, I…

791
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,639
That's disappointing.

792
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,307
I called you over to tell you

793
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,018
that I like you.

794
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,230
I like you.

795
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,869
I haven't liked anyone
for a very long time.

796
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,037
But…

797
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,791
I have a feeling I'll like you…

798
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,753
for a long time to come.

799
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,285
Jeez, where are my car keys?

800
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:29,829
Hey, have you seen my phone?

801
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,957
I saw your phone upstairs.

802
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,346
Damn.

803
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,139
I didn't need to see that.

804
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:49,641
Spit it out, guys.

805
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:53,144
I can't believe
I caught my sister getting all romantic.

806
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,689
-Gross!
-We might end up being in-laws after all.

807
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,316
I just got chills!

808
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,276
This won't do. We need to pray.

809
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,445
Please help us forget
everything we saw today.

810
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,030
-Please help us forget.
-Please help us forget.

811
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,949
-Amen.
-Amen.

812
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,952
Gosh, it feels awkward
now that the lights are on.

813
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:10,745
-Shall I turn them off again?
-No!

814
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:20,713
Just go on ten dates with me.

815
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:26,636
Why ten dates?

816
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,721
You don't seem to trust me,

817
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,765
so let's go on ten dates for now.

818
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,433
If that goes well,
we'll keep seeing each other.

819
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,521
-And what if it doesn't?
-Why are you being so negative?

820
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,481
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

821
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:43,528
I have a question.

822
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,282
When we talked on Onion,

823
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,286
what did you think of Soulishere?

824
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,371
-I liked her, of course.
-Then why did you delete your account?

825
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,416
So I could focus on Wi Jeong-sin.

826
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,171
Right!

827
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,007
I understand.

828
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:05,800
If you'll excuse me,

829
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:07,510
I have to go now.

830
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,141
Wi Hong-sin, I'm leaving!

831
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,821
Look at you. Were you that nervous?

832
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:30,199
-Everyone, Wi Jeong-sin got confessed to!
-Hey!

833
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:31,701
Why did you accept all of that?

834
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:33,494
He was offering them,
and I couldn't refuse.

835
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,039
Anyway,

836
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,708
you two were like enemies,
so when did you become…

837
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,460
There's that fist again.

838
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:41,919
-Get away from me!
-You're so dead!

839
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,387
I like you.

840
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,516
I have a feeling I'll like you
for a long time to come.

841
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,438
When we talked on Onion,

842
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,232
what did you think about Soulishere?

843
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,777
-I liked her, of course.
-Then why did you delete your account?

844
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,945
So I could focus on Wi Jeong-sin.

845
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,457
Calm down.

846
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,293
Just calm down.

847
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,047
Forget about it.

848
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:29,676
I like you.

849
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,302
I'll like you

850
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,304
for a long time to come.

851
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,516
Just go on ten dates with me.

852
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,433
Onion!

853
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,066
Soulishere.

854
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,192
You can't sleep, can you?

855
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:50,571
Why did you run away like that earlier?

856
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:54,075
I felt shy.

857
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,371
Wi Jeong-sin, feeling shy?

858
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:00,998
I'm human too, you know.

859
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:04,669
Now that I think about it,
you have a rather unusual taste too.

860
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,421
What about it?

861
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,257
Only a handful of people
get along with me.

862
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,551
Come on, who says we get along?

863
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:16,305
I'm just a man with a big heart

864
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,307
who can handle being with you.

865
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,395
It's your good luck
to have met someone like me.

866
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,192
I see.

867
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:29,902
Lucky me.

868
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,824
How are you with your anxiety?

869
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:36,701
It's better.

870
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:39,454
Weirdly enough,
I've been feeling good these days.

871
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:41,914
I think it's thanks to someone.

872
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,215
I've been the man of the house
since I was young, so I get it.

873
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:53,843
Sometimes, my family makes life harder
than anyone else.

874
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,431
What do you do
when life gets hard, Mr. Lim?

875
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,103
I just bear through it.

876
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:05,813
Then after a while,

877
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,983
I realize, "Oh, I got through it."

878
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,528
"It passes, just like it always does."

879
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:14,280
From now on, when life gets hard,

880
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,365
I'm going to sit outside in the sun.

881
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,534
Like the way you taught me, Soulishere.

882
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,415
By the way,
why did you message me on Onion?

883
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:30,379
You obviously weren't over Melomaster,

884
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,340
so I thought I'd surprise you.

885
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,884
I even changed my nickname, you know.

886
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:39,180
I have a question too.

887
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,431
What is it?

888
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:41,891
I've been curious.

889
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:43,976
When I apologized to you that day
at Hangang River,

890
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,229
why didn't you accept it?

891
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,234
If I accepted your apology,

892
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,696
I knew I'd expect more of you,
so I kept my guard up.

893
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,826
You pretended you weren't,

894
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:02,662
but you're totally into me.

895
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:05,039
No, I'm not.

896
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,084
Seriously.

897
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:46,539
TUESDAY, JULY 1ST

898
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:05,600
-The documents you requested.
-Thank you.

899
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:23,492
Bro!

900
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:25,745
Where is he?

901
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,414
You're still asleep?

902
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:30,166
Are you insane?

903
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,918
Get up!

904
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:34,962
Do you know what time it is?
We have to be there by 6 p.m.!

905
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:36,964
We're in so much trouble.

906
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:39,592
It'll take over three hours to get there
because of rush hour traffic!

907
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:40,927
Hurry up and get up!

908
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:44,513
-The shoot.
-Yes, the shoot!

909
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:46,557
Jeez, I've lost my mind.

910
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,018
-Oh, man.
-There's no time to wash up.

911
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,728
-Hold on.
-What is it?

912
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:52,855
My phone.

913
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,192
-My phone.
-That damn phone.

914
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:58,736
What did you just say?

915
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:02,073
Chairman Lee Dae-ho hired someone
to orchestrate Lee Jae-hyeong's accident.

916
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,951
Back when I was at the US branch
of a business newspaper,

917
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:07,119
I was covering the Lemon incident.

918
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,705
I had proof that Lee Dae-ho was behind it,

919
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:12,041
and my article was almost finished.

920
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:12,959
That's when…

921
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,129
President Lee Jae-hyeong
got into a car accident.

922
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:20,216
I know it was him.

923
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:24,387
Chairman Lee Dae-ho

924
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,431
is even worse than I thought.

925
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,475
How could he do that
to his younger brother?

926
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,315
Here's everything I gathered
on the Lemon incident.

927
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:37,858
Including this information

928
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,611
will turn the case huge.

929
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:41,570
Are you sure about this?

930
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:47,910
If we want this to blow up,

931
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,454
it needs to be big.

932
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:52,456
That's the only way to make serious noise.

933
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,731
Let me say this again. You could get hurt.

934
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:17,732
Or maybe even

935
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,443
someone close to you.

936
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,028
If you're not ready for that,

937
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:23,904
it'd be better not to look.

938
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,955
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO RECORDS,
LEMON FUND MANAGEMENT

939
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,543
Gil-su, can you step on it?

940
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:38,544
Sure.

941
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,630
Yeah, Director Bak will complain again.

942
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,883
What kept you up all night?

943
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,886
-Is your insomnia acting up again?
-It's not like that.

944
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,893
Did you just laugh?

945
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:55,686
No, I didn't.

946
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,104
Let's step on it!

947
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:58,355
-Okay.
-Yeah, let's hurry.

948
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:16,165
One of them

949
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:20,002
covered the aide's suicide case
when you were an assemblyman.

950
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:22,671
The other one covered the Lemon incident.

951
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:25,299
And now, the two of them have joined hands

952
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:27,802
to hound both of us.

953
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:30,304
What should we do about this?

954
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,557
It'd be best to take care of it
like last time, right?

955
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,332
-Grab our stuff and meet us inside.
-Okay.

956
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,001
-Damn it.
-We're in big trouble.

957
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,671
-What is it?
-What's wrong with this?

958
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,089
Hey, the door is locked.

959
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:07,258
-What?
-What the heck?

960
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:08,676
It's locked.

961
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,762
Wait, this is Building G.

962
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:14,807
-We're supposed to go to Building H.
-Come on, Gil-su.

963
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:15,724
Bro, get in.

964
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:18,102
Go ahead and park the car.
I'll walk over there.

965
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,062
Okay, I'll grab our stuff
and meet you there.

966
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:21,647
Hey, hurry up and go.

967
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,107
Jeez.

968
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,482
What's going on?

969
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:11,822
Is it a crew member?

970
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:56,742
Let me say this again.

971
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,702
You could get hurt.

972
00:58:58,786 --> 00:58:59,870
Or maybe even

973
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,956
someone close to you.

974
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:38,492
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

975
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,580
Chairman Lee Dae-ho is a ruthless man.

976
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,124
I'm sure he planned it all from the start.

977
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,333
Fired?

978
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,376
Why would you get fired?

979
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,754
Ms. Wi, I desperately need
your help right now.

980
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:51,880
If we're going to strike back,

981
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,465
-we need evidence first.
-Move aside!

982
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:55,134
They wouldn't let us in.

983
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,969
Ms. Wi's clothes got ripped.

984
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:58,554
Her clothes got ripped?

985
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,015
Those bastards won't get away with this.

986
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:02,975
Damn it, get out of the way!

987
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:03,934
Ms. Wi!

988
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:07,479
I'm not the type
to take crap from anyone, either.

989
