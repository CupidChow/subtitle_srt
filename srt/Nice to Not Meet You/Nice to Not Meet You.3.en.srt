1
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,651
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin?

2
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,946
-Yes?
-May I have

3
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:12,865
a moment of your time?

4
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,450
Right now?

5
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,580
But I'm on my way to work.

6
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,874
I just need a moment.

7
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,086
You said
your brother's a detective, right?

8
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,631
What? Oh, that's right.

9
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,841
Does he have a girlfriend?

10
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,426
I don't think so.

11
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,054
So what's his type?

12
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,847
I'm not sure,

13
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,058
but maybe someone intellectual?

14
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,268
I see. The intellectual type.

15
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:44,104
-My sister went to Hankuk University.
-Really?

16
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,940
She must've been a top student.

17
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:49,819
But why ask about my brother?

18
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,364
Well, my sister is
surprisingly decent-looking,

19
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,657
but she hasn't dated anyone.

20
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,201
I can see that. My brother's the same.

21
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,287
If I let him be,
he might end up marrying an AI assistant.

22
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,502
I'm sorry for showing up unannounced.

23
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,504
-Sorry?
-You must be startled.

24
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,588
Well, I…

25
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:12,049
It's all right.

26
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,592
What brings you here all of a sudden?

27
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,012
I came to apologize.

28
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,473
Apologize to me?

29
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,475
Yes.

30
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,062
For getting you
kicked out of the interview.

31
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,189
I want to apologize for that.

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,192
Looking back at it now,

33
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:33,904
what I did was incredibly rude
and should've never happened.

34
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,032
I'm truly sorry.

35
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,159
Right.

36
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,374
With that in mind…

37
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:51,046
My lawyer and I

38
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,049
prepared an agreement.

39
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,594
"Agreement."

40
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,346
"Wi Jeong-sin
shall not publish any information

41
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,225
about Lim Hyeon-jun without
first confirming it with his agency."

42
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,937
"Should she publish an article
harming the actor's reputation,

43
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,064
she must pay the agreed compensation."

44
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,775
"If this agreement is honored
for the next five years,

45
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,528
she will be granted
at least two exclusive interviews per year

46
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,405
and will receive exclusive coverage rights

47
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,325
for any dramas, films, or projects
in which the actor is cast."

48
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,454
My lawyer and I put our heads together

49
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:28,000
to figure out how you and I
could have a constructive relationship.

50
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,793
A win-win situation, that is.

51
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,796
It'll benefit me
as my private life won't be publicized,

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,007
and it'll benefit you
as you'll be able to publish exclusives

53
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,508
and get acknowledged at work.

54
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,761
Something like that.

55
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,473
My lawyer and I even got it notarized.

56
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,766
Hey!

57
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,144
AGREEMENT

58
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,022
If you ever show up like this
one more time,

59
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,943
every article I've written
will look tame compared to what's next.

60
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:59,281
I can destroy you
with nothing more than my writing.

61
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,409
I can teach you what it feels like
for your blood to run cold

62
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,078
and your throat to clamp shut.

63
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,621
Keep going…

64
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,624
if you want to find out.

65
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,223
You want to set up your sister
with my brother?

66
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,977
EPISODE 3

67
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,112
If you ever show up like this
one more time,

68
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:42,074
every article I've written
will look tame compared to what's next.

69
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,037
You're back in the game, Wi Jeong-sin.

70
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,706
My head's on straight.

71
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,381
I think I messed with
the wrong crazy lady.

72
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,758
So why did you have to stir things up?

73
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,802
Don't you know how proud reporters are?

74
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,096
Exactly. Since she has no money or fame,

75
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,182
she's living off nothing but pride,
so of course, it's important.

76
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:10,853
And you stomped all over
that important pride, bro!

77
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,021
No, that's not it.

78
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,441
Imagine how much her pride must hurt
working at a hostess bar.

79
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,608
As a reporter, I mean.

80
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:21,530
That's not something you do as a hobby,
so she's obviously doing it for the money.

81
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,407
If she gets exclusive coverage rights,

82
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,284
she can earn both money
and recognition at work.

83
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,202
She'd be killing two birds with one stone.

84
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,871
Are you sure she works at a hostess bar?

85
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,248
She doesn't look like the type at all!

86
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,709
Looks can be deceiving.

87
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,046
You're a manager for an actor,
so you should know this by now.

88
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,965
Well, they do say
never to trust those in the show biz.

89
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,300
What did you say?

90
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,052
-Hey, head to the office.
-Yes, sir.

91
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,511
I have something important to tell you.

92
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,598
What is it? Did we get a project offer?

93
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,109
Wait.

94
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,862
You should clean that up before you go.

95
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,113
The cleaning staff will do it.

96
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,158
If we can dump trash anywhere
because we have the cleaning staff,

97
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,077
then why are there fines for littering?

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,662
If you're unsure about public etiquette,
how about I teach you?

99
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,582
If you're here to guard someone,
do that instead of getting physical!

100
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,209
You're only disgracing
the artist you're bodyguarding!

101
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,254
-What did you just say?
-Hey, forget it.

102
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,591
If you don't have public etiquette,
what about a conscience?

103
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,391
Seriously, the trash can's right there.

104
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,275
A small-town widowed detective?

105
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,361
How is this any different
from Kang Pil-gu?

106
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,447
How is this going to
change my public image?

107
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,699
Why do you insist
on changing your public image?

108
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,077
Don't you know how lucky you are
to be called by your character's name?

109
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,121
It's actually a blessing, bro.

110
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,873
Don't you know how much
an actor's public image matters?

111
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:55,874
My mom…

112
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,298
You know what I'm talking about.

113
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,050
Come on, bro.

114
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,553
It was a totally different time back then.

115
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,679
Listen.

116
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,389
My mom still can't escape
that erotic film actress image,

117
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,308
even though 40 years have passed!

118
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,477
Mr. Hwang.

119
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,647
I want to have a long-lasting career.

120
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,899
That's why I'm behaving this way.

121
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,405
What about the plays?

122
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,323
The plays?

123
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,783
Yeah.

124
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,744
Right, so the thing is…

125
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,079
Lim Hyeon-jun?

126
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,455
We'd love to have him!

127
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,417
Our theater group
is starting a new project.

128
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,918
It's called The Old Detective.

129
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,753
Our play has just opened,

130
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,965
so the next one won't begin
until next fall.

131
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,758
Our play is about a university judo team,

132
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:47,968
so he's not the right age.

133
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,346
Perhaps we could
disguise him with makeup, sir?

134
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,184
I wonder why no one's reaching out.

135
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,025
What's that?

136
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,699
-What's this?
-Just read it.

137
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,492
A PLACE TO STAY

138
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,746
Someone did reach out, after all.

139
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,707
But what's with the face?

140
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,460
Is the script that terrible?

141
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,426
Seon-u, when will you tell your family

142
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,178
that you're taking a break
from med school?

143
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,679
I'll tell them sometime.

144
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,849
Didn't your brother work really hard
to support you?

145
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,312
By the way, do you really want to
set up your sister with my brother?

146
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,230
Yeah.

147
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,981
If it works out, great. If not, oh well.

148
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,776
Do you have a photo of her?

149
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,403
A photo of my sister?

150
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,491
There should be one right here.
This is what she looks like.

151
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,078
Man, she's beautiful!
And she looks so intellectual.

152
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:56,995
What?

153
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,041
Well, what about your brother?

154
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,417
-Do you have a photo?
-My brother?

155
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,589
He looks like that.

156
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,716
-They look very similar.
-Really?

157
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,511
I'd totally welcome
a brother-in-law like Pil-gu.

158
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,763
Kang Pil-gu's pick! Kang Pil-gu mode, on!

159
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,974
KANG PIL-GU'S PICK!

160
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,234
A PLACE TO STAY

161
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,573
Man, this is good.

162
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,033
HWANG JI-SUN

163
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,077
Hey, Mr. Hwang!

164
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,288
Tell them I want to do this.

165
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,374
-Oh, you like it?
-I love it.

166
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,751
I don't want anyone
stealing this role from me.

167
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,503
So call them right now, and say I'm in.

168
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,046
Do you like it that much?

169
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,590
Since he's a doctor
who recovers after being ill,

170
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,759
I should probably lose some weight, right?

171
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,886
That's it. I'm going on a diet.

172
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,098
Darn it, I've gained some weight
around my waist recently.

173
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,726
Do I need help slimming it down?

174
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,020
Anyway, I want this role.
Call them right away, got it?

175
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,565
In that case, you should come right now.

176
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:07,941
Right now?

177
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,569
Su-ji, play some upbeat music.

178
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,486
Sure.

179
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,460
Hyeon-jun.

180
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,295
You look like you're in a good mood.

181
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,841
Yeah, I guess I am.

182
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,802
You've been coming by often.

183
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,929
-Don't you have to study?
-Well, the exams are over.

184
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,598
Hey, how does a blind date sound?

185
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,770
A blind date?

186
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,898
With who?

187
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,857
My friend's sister.

188
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,193
I saw a photo of her,
and she's totally your type.

189
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,110
Well…

190
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,696
What does she do?

191
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,198
She went to Hankuk University
and works as a reporter.

192
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,575
You…

193
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,286
Reporters infuriate me so much,
they keep me up at night!

194
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,830
Besides, who goes on blind dates
at my age?

195
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:04,956
People should meet naturally.

196
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,666
Organic dating is tough for you now!

197
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,462
Hey, this is Lim Hyeon-jun
you're talking to.

198
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:11,797
Got it?

199
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,899
Hello? Have you arrived?

200
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,943
I'll be right out.

201
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,778
All right.

202
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,034
RESERVED

203
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,041
That's enough.

204
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,775
-Why did you sigh?
-I didn't sigh.

205
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,068
Why? What's going on?

206
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,361
Nothing's going on.

207
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,758
Why am I here?

208
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,594
That script you really liked…

209
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,429
She's the female lead.

210
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,851
Mr. Hwang, can you give us a moment?

211
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,605
Take a seat.

212
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,160
I heard you really liked the script.

213
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,411
Let's do it.

214
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,459
If one of us has to drop out,

215
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,294
who do you think that should be?

216
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,172
-Between you and me, that is.
-No, don't.

217
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,173
Don't talk like that.

218
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,550
Don't you want to be in this movie?

219
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,345
Aren't you sick of just being Kang Pil-gu?

220
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,057
Have you lost your memory?

221
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,937
Don't you remember why
I left the industry in the first place?

222
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,356
Do you seriously not know…

223
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,484
what you did to me?

224
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,279
You need to drop out.

225
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,574
We can't possibly work together
on the same project.

226
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,326
Se-na.

227
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,454
You're the lead character,
and I'm a supporting character.

228
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:53,250
-No one will care about us.
-But I will.

229
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,918
It bothers me.

230
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,462
I really need this role.

231
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,970
Is this how you're going to be?

232
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,974
Will I have to drop out
every time we end up on the same project?

233
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,187
Do you want me to disappear entirely
from this industry?

234
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,149
Yes.

235
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,485
It'd be great if you disappeared.

236
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,781
Close the door, will you?

237
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,585
Fine.

238
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,253
I'll do it.

239
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,548
Yes.

240
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,049
-You'll do it?
-Yeah.

241
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,843
What's there to stop me?

242
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,678
But let's go over a few things first.

243
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,096
How much are they offering?

244
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,932
How much are they paying you, Se-na?

245
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,517
One billion won? Two billion?

246
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,520
Whatever the case,

247
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:59,357
I want double what she's getting.

248
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,734
That's okay, right?

249
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,695
-Come on, bro.
-Why not?

250
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,073
I feel like shit,
so I might as well get paid well for it.

251
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,619
I'll have to stand in front of her,
laughing and crying,

252
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,662
and putting on the performance of my life.

253
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,415
So I deserve to get paid
at least that much, don't you think?

254
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,667
-Right, Mr. Hwang?
-Yes.

255
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,641
We've arrived.

256
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,810
Good work today, Gil-su.
You can get going.

257
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,646
Okay. I'll be off, then.

258
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,988
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yeah?

259
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,325
I don't want to be manipulated
by Gwon Se-na again.

260
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,493
Of course not.

261
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,328
If you don't want to do it, then don't.

262
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,621
You can just be Kang Pil-gu…

263
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,585
There's something
I've been thinking about for a while.

264
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,588
They say to turn a crisis
into an opportunity.

265
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,008
-I think I'm ready to give it a shot.
-Give what a shot?

266
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,178
-I want to take my career overseas.
-Overseas?

267
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,888
Where? Hollywood?

268
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,933
I'll send out demo videos,
go to auditions,

269
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,352
set up meetings, and do whatever I can.

270
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,397
So prepare yourself.

271
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,542
Goodness. Hello, Son.

272
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:41,876
Did you just get back?

273
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,670
What's all this?

274
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,172
They sell the same in Korea

275
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,175
but for so much cheaper,
so I couldn't help but buy them.

276
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,387
Right, of course.

277
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,099
Doctor.

278
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,561
Mi-ran used to play my character's maid
back in the day.

279
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,524
You know, when the main character
was hopelessly in love with me,

280
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,111
she'd swoop in and seduce him
while I wasn't looking.

281
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,990
Who knew her career
would take off like that?

282
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,075
Can you stop talking about that?

283
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,162
Shooting erotic films
isn't something to be proud of.

284
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,915
I only filmed three!

285
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,543
She became TV's favorite mom
after playing my maid

286
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,754
and went on to win awards
at the Cannes Film Festival.

287
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,423
Everyone started out that way back then.

288
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,133
If only I'd continued acting--

289
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,968
Jeez, cut.

290
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,262
Anyway, why are you here?
Why didn't you go home?

291
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,850
I wanted to talk to you about something.

292
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,770
Listen, Jun.

293
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,273
Can you buy me another car?

294
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,108
-Another one?
-Yes.

295
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,319
You want me to buy you another car?

296
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,405
The thing is…

297
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,949
I let someone borrow

298
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,285
the car that I had.

299
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,047
The patient's oxygen levels are dropping!
Secure the airway and…

300
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,426
Excuse me.

301
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,512
When can I see a doctor?
Will I have to wait long?

302
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,055
It'll just be a moment.

303
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,238
Are you out of your mind?

304
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,866
He's a con man
trying to live off your public image!

305
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,035
Director Jang isn't like that!

306
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,914
-He's an artist!
-An artist? Are you kidding me?

307
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,459
Then tell me, does this movie
not have any nude scenes in it?

308
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,128
I could do it just this once
for the sake of the movie…

309
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,922
-Come on, Mom!
-What?

310
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,549
You can't take off your clothes!

311
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,219
Oh, why not? I want to do this movie.

312
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,347
I read Director Jang's movie script,

313
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,932
-and it's a work of art.
-Art, my ass.

314
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,851
It could go to Cannes.

315
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,269
Cannes isn't some kind of joke!

316
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,814
The only thing he filmed
was a third-rate movie 20 years ago!

317
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,440
He's basically jobless right now!

318
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,651
-Get it together, please!
-Hey!

319
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,737
Why can't you be more understanding?

320
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,408
I got the best script offers
when I was in my prime,

321
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,535
but I gave it all up after I had you.

322
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,413
I know I shouldn't say this as a mother,

323
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,915
but if I hadn't
given birth to you back then,

324
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:30,211
I could've escaped my sexy public image,
and my career would've taken off!

325
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:32,839
Well,

326
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,342
at least you're aware
it's not something a mother should say.

327
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,635
I know you're my son,

328
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,847
but I can't help but envy you.

329
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,128
I know you're my son,

330
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,007
but I can't help but envy you.

331
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,179
You must be Ms. Seong Ae-suk's son.

332
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,639
Do you know my mom?

333
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,640
Of course.

334
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,850
Your mom is a very famous actress.

335
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,393
You look just like her.

336
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,687
THE GODMOTHER

337
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,650
Move aside! Where's Seong Ae-suk?

338
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,612
I don't even know
who the hell your husband is!

339
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,198
Why? Is it because
you can't keep track of all your men?

340
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,870
Hyeon-jun is a good boy
and he's very smart.

341
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,413
Goodness.

342
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:51,000
Hyeon-jun, you're so lucky
to have such a beautiful mom.

343
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,637
If I hadn't given birth to you back then,

344
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,432
I could've escaped my sexy public image,
and my career would've taken off!

345
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,181
PUBLISH REQUEST SENT!

346
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,606
I just published
the article on Han Chi-su.

347
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,524
Where are you?

348
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,110
I'm at the emergency room.

349
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,820
The emergency room? Why?

350
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:01,779
My stomach hurts badly.

351
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,824
Did you just write an article in the ER?

352
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:05,908
Yes.

353
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:08,286
All right.

354
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,413
Get checked and call me later.

355
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,456
All right.

356
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,434
Hyeon-jun!

357
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,729
-The person you are trying to reach…
-Bro!

358
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:35,646
Bro?

359
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,025
Bro.

360
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,028
Bro!

361
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:43,863
Where the hell is he?

362
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:47,867
Hyeon-jun!

363
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,412
Hyeon-jun!

364

119 EMERGENCY SERVICES

365
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,215
Jeong-sin, are you okay? Are you awake?

366
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,342
What happened?

367
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,845
Your appendix burst,
so you had to have surgery.

368
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,013
My appendix?

369
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,768
Why'd you put up with the pain
until you passed out?

370
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,394
Be quiet.

371
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,604
Hankuk University grad, my ass.

372
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,564
You can't even speak up
when you're in pain.

373
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,900
-Why do you act so dumb?
-Cut it out.

374
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,276
It's not like I'm dying.

375
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,737
It's just…

376
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,199
You're the only family I have left.

377
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,035
What's wrong with you?

378
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,204
I was so scared.

379
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,165
This is so annoying, damn it.

380
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,504
SPORTS EUNSEONG

381
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:45,341
I met Lee Mi-ra yesterday.
She's in the new SBC variety show In Sync.

382
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,135
But there's not much to write about.

383
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,637
She just said she gained 5 kg
while on a break.

384
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,139
Then make that the main headline.

385
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:54,517
"Lee Mi-ra Struggles with Weight Gain."
Something like that.

386
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,770
-Yes, ma'am.
-Chief, with Ms. Wi gone,

387
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:01,315
Mr. Ha has been covering for her,
but it's getting to be a bit much.

388
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,318
I think we need a plan
in case Ms. Wi is gone for a while.

389
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:08,739
This is Yun Hwa-yeong.

390
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,325
Early this morning?

391
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:12,910
Which hospital?

392
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,163
Understood.

393
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:20,001
Lim Hyeon-jun was taken to the ER
after a suicide attempt.

394
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,127
Lim Hyeon-jun?

395
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,963
He took a bunch of sleeping pills,
but word hasn't spread yet.

396
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,631
Write up an exclusive right now.

397
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,217
He's at Gusan University Hospital.
Ha Seong-min, go there now.

398
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,512
Gusan University Hospital?
That's where Ms. Wi was admitted.

399
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,850
I'm telling you that's not what happened!

400
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,894
I had a drink but still couldn't sleep,

401
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,521
so I took a few sleeping pills
from a previous prescription.

402
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,772
That's it!

403
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:46,485
Why did you take "a few" sleeping pills
instead of the prescribed dosage?

404
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,405
One didn't work,
so I took a few, all right?

405
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,950
I'm in this mess right now
because you panicked and reported me!

406
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,369
Bro, do you swear
you're telling the truth?

407
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,579
Do you think I'm crazy?

408
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,914
You think I took meds to kill myself?

409
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,210
-For goodness' sake.
-Then you should've been more careful!

410
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:03,127
This is a crucial moment for you.

411
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,712
Just say I collapsed from exhaustion.

412
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,631
You're good at spinning the media.

413
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:07,590
Forget it.

414
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,884
Use this opportunity
to get a proper hospital check-up.

415
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,094
When you kept taking
those herbal calming pills,

416
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,763
it made me feel really uneasy.

417
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,514
What hospital?

418
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:16,474
A psychiatric hospital?

419
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,351
Yeah. I know a good one.

420
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,019
You're overreacting.

421
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,104
I just want to go home.

422
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,525
Wait, hold on.

423
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,110
I need to stay longer.

424
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,196
-You sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

425
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,530
I'm perfectly fine.

426
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,573
-I'm staying longer.
-Bro.

427
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:35,159
-Bro, are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm staying.

428
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,203
Hey, get in touch with Byeong-gi.

429
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,205
Nurse!

430
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,248
Hey, eat quietly.

431
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,168
-Are you rubbing it in?
-Quit moving around,

432
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,336
or your stitches will pop.

433
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,880
At least I'm not looking at you as I eat.

434
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,090
So just be patient.

435
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,300
Once you pass some gas,

436
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,552
your sweet brother
will cook whatever you like.

437
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,554
But before that, I have a favor to ask.

438
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,807
Well, save it
because I won't do any favors for you.

439
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,016
Would you be interested in a blind date?

440
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,895
Why would I trust anyone
you introduce me to?

441
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,357
I have a friend who goes to med school.

442
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,361
-It's his brother. He's a detective.
-Detectives hate reporters.

443
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,029
He'll refuse to see me first.

444
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,864
Just leave that to me.

445
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,993
Having a detective as a boyfriend
could be helpful in your line of work.

446
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,703
On top of that, I hear he's handsome.

447
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,038
He looks like that.
They look very similar.

448
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,541
He looks like my bro Pil-gu.
Lim Hyeon-jun, that is.

449
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,044
-Kang Pil-gu?
-Yeah.

450
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,303
Don't regret it later.

451
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,346
Let's get you out of your SSB status
before you get older.

452
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:42,852
Wi Jeong-sin, I see you're still alive.

453
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,564
Lim Hyeon-jun attempted suicide?

454
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,025
Shouldn't you be up to date
with entertainment news?

455
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,611
Lim Hyeon-jun was brought to this ER
after overdosing on sleeping pills.

456
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,030
That's why I need you.

457
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,657
You want to return
to the main paper, don't you?

458
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:59,660
You'll need to demonstrate clear results
to justify your return.

459
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,122
What kind of results can I show
from something like this?

460
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,876
Lim Hyeon-jun's agency will claim
he just collapsed from exhaustion.

461
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,794
And the truth will get buried.

462
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,547
But I want special coverage of this story.

463
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,299
While you're here,

464
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,426
find out everything you can
about his suicide attempt

465
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,803
and get some photos of him
during his stay.

466
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:22,099
If you come up with ten useful scoops
including this article,

467
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,518
I'll get you back to the main paper
within three months.

468
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,771
What do you say?

469
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,525
What is it?

470
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,444
You want to return to the main paper,

471
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,155
but you're annoyed
you have to chase after a celebrity again?

472
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,073
I…

473
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,658
-It's not that.
-Wi Jeong-sin.

474
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,160
Don't underestimate them.

475
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,705
You think anyone
can become an actor or an idol?

476
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:46,540
They win film awards abroad,
boost our country's image,

477
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:47,958
and bring in foreign revenue.

478
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,669
They're better than most politicians
or businessmen, don't you think?

479
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,713
So why wouldn't they be worth covering?

480
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,803
-That's not what I meant.
-Then what is it?

481
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,055
Do you like Lim Hyeon-jun?

482
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,890
No, I don't!

483
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,393
I really don't!

484
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,061
Why are you getting worked up?

485
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,606
Tell me now. Are you in it or not?

486
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,652
Of course, I'm in.

487
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,406
Please keep your promise, though.
You said three months.

488
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,844
-Excuse me. Hello.
-Hello.

489
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:45,015
I heard from a friend
that actor Lim Hyeon-jun

490
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,518
was brought to the ER in this hospital.

491
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,980
-Oh, boy.
-We're not sure about that ourselves.

492
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,232
I was just curious

493
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,026
because I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

494
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,736
We're just as curious,

495
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,239
-but the VIP ward has very tight security.
-I see.

496
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,323
Well,

497
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,617
what floor is the VIP ward on?

498
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,245
Oh dear.

499
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,831
I was shocked
when I saw the news this morning.

500
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,916
I'm just tired these days, that's all.

501
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:15,212
I know you're busy.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.

502
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,380
Not at all.

503
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,632
But do you have something to tell me?

504
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,176
Byeong-gi.

505
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,135
Yes?

506
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,472
Is it okay to drop honorifics with you?

507
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,682
Yes, please speak freely in private.

508
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,019
I know you want to go into directing.

509
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:33,647
How long will you be tied down
writing drama scripts?

510
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,525
It's not that
I don't want to play Kang Pil-gu.

511
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:41,822
I just desperately want to act
in a different role.

512
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,908
-How much will it take?
-Excuse me?

513
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:47,203
I'll lend you the money
for the building loan you took out,

514
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,537
interest-free.

515
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,625
Byeong-gi.

516
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:55,669
Give me your hand.

517
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:00,674
Listen, Byeong-gi.

518
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:05,804
Don't write the next season
of Kang Pil-gu, okay?

519
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,349
Please, I'm begging you to stop.

520
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,725
Please?

521
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,436
I held back from saying this
in case it went to your head,

522
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,356
but good writers like you are rare.

523
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,400
If you refuse,
no one else can take on Kang Pil-gu.

524
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,486
Everything will fall apart.

525
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,906
You're not getting
any other offers anyway.

526
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,282
I'm still seeking them.

527
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,164
Mr. Bak, think it over the next few days.

528
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,792
You know I'm right.

529
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,461
Oh my goodness.

530
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,172
-Man, this hurts.
-Right.

531
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,424
Take care of yourself, Mr. Lim.

532
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:43,509
And stay healthy.

533
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,593
Thanks.

534
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,304
By the way, I brought some cookies.

535
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,473
Make sure to eat them,
even if you don't like sweets.

536
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:52,851
Don't give them away.
Promise me you'll eat them.

537
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,270
But I stopped eating carbs.

538
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,146
You won't have energy
if you don't eat carbs.

539
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,441
-I'll get going, then.
-Okay, thanks.

540
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,070
-See you next time.
-All right. Thanks.

541
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:17,793
Why would he give me cookies
after telling me to stay healthy?

542
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,211
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5
EPISODE 1

543
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,424
You little bastard!

544
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,760
I called you here
to tell you not to write this,

545
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:27,845
but you did it anyway!

546
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:29,680
Damn it!

547
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:40,566
VIP WARD

548
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,944
GUSAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

549
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:02,463
Where did you hear such an absurd rumor?

550
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,883
You're the first reporter I'd tell
if something like that were to happen.

551
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,092
You know that, right?

552
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,948
Did you see him?
It's Lim Hyeon-jun, right?

553
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,242
-Stop that. Be quiet.
-It's him, isn't it?

554
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,088
Are you on call today?

555
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,924
I haven't slept in two days,
so I'm about to pass out.

556
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,426
I don't think I can go home.

557
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,514
-Is it really Lim Hyeon-jun?
-Don't you dare tell anyone.

558
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,890
I won't. Just hurry up and tell me!

559
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,100
Early this morning…

560
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,108
We've been away for too long.
Let's talk back there.

561
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,259
Why did they schedule so many tests?

562
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,720
How should I know?
I'm just doing as I'm told.

563
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:34,972
Put your hat on.

564
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,056
-Put it on?
-Yeah.

565
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,185
I could've been out of here by now
if it hadn't been for these tests.

566
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,895
I'm stuck here because of those tests!

567
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,797
VIP PATIENT ROOM

568
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,858
Why are there so many damn tests?

569
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,736
What's the point of all this
if I'm leaving soon anyway?

570
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,280
Jeez, you just made a mess of things.

571
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,991
Why did they schedule
all these useless tests?

572
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,953
-I can't leave because of them!
-I'm going to use the restroom.

573
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,625
What the heck?

574
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,584
What's going on?

575
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,294
The door won't open.

576
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,589
Jun?

577
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,635
Hello, ma'am.

578
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,011
-Let me take that.
-Okay.

579
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,183
Ma'am, I have to
attend to an urgent matter.

580
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,227
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

581
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,106
Goodness.

582
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,609
How could you take
the wrong dose of your medicine?

583
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:11,777
I told you not to come.

584
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,737
How could I not come
when my son's in the hospital?

585
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,156
Seon-u wanted to come,
but I knew you'd throw a fit,

586
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,366
so I barely got him to stay.

587
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,577
I just didn't want you
to get photographed by reporters.

588
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:21,829
Jeez.

589
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,956
-You're ashamed of me, aren't you?
-No, I'm not.

590
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,834
I'm not ashamed at all.
Who said I was ashamed?

591
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,669
Why would I be ashamed?

592
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,045
You haven't eaten yet, right?

593
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,173
-I'll prepare some fruit.
-I don't want to eat any fruit!

594
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,259
Don't prepare any fruit!

595
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,760
Just leave.

596
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,472
You're old enough

597
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,142
to know better
than to take the wrong dosage.

598
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,939
When will he ever settle down
and get married?

599
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:55,904
I still look good.

600
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,327
Where's the knife?

601
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,669
Who are you?

602
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,261
Hello,

603
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:20,929
Mother.

604
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,434
Goodness, what brings you here?

605
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,769
Are you two dating again?

606
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,075
She's even more shameless than I thought.

607
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,620
Why is she here now
after leaving him so heartlessly?

608
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,622
That nasty wench.

609
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,052
How are you feeling?

610
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,054
Has my pay been sorted out?

611
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:05,349
Did they agree to give me double your pay?

612
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,100
I tried my best to persuade them.

613
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:12,314
-They agreed to match your pay to mine.
-Jeez.

614
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,858
That's top pay in the industry.

615
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:17,444
That's nowhere near enough.

616
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,113
The movie shoot itself
will be a grueling ordeal.

617
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,908
I can't do the shoot
without proper assurances.

618
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,383
This was the first gift you gave me.

619
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,678
We listened to it a lot together.

620
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,185
I kept it this whole time.

621
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:54,606
I haven't listened to it in a while
because I've been so busy,

622
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,400
but whenever I hear this song,

623
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,985
my heart aches a bit.

624
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,862
Even though
I haven't listened to it in so long,

625
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,323
I still remember all the lyrics

626
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:05,993
to this song.

627
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:10,038
That's how clearly
those days are etched in my memory.

628
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,626
Why are you doing this to me?

629
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,755
Do you still have feelings for me?

630
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:20,424
Yes.

631
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:22,759
A lot.

632
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:10,348
JJUN-I & SSE-NA

633
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:24,654
It's me.

634
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:29,826
I'll go on that blind date
you mentioned before.

635
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,995
No, I'm going to do it!

636
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,289
Set up a date. The sooner the better!

637
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,917
You're serious, right?
No backing out, okay?

638
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,295
-Okay.
-The bus arriving shortly is…

639
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,842
My brother agreed to the blind date.

640
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:47,803
Yes!

641
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:09,699
Oh, no.

642
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,169
-Who's in there?
-Oh, no.

643
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,589
What's going on? Open up, damn it!

644
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,016
Goddamn it.

645
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,273
Bro, your mother just left… Goodness.

646
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,692
-What are you doing?
-I…

647
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,991
You're unbelievable.

648
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,160
Mr. Hwang.

649
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,077
Sue her.

650
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:58,540
-Sue her for invasion of privacy.
-That's enough.

651
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,293
Jeez, I hope you don't get a bruise.

652
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,297
Ms. Wi, respectfully,
you really can't act this way.

653
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,590
"Respectfully"?

654
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:10,218
Did you just say "respectfully" to her?

655
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:11,219
"Respectfully"?

656
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,471
Come on, bro…

657
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,224
I mean, Hyeon-jun. Please calm down.

658
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,894
Wow.

659
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,938
You were cursing me out not too long ago,

660
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,316
but I guess you need me now.

661
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:26,234
I must have been crazy.

662
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,404
Why did I even bother apologizing,
knowing what you're like?

663
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,407
If you had just cooperated with the press,

664
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,868
I wouldn't have had to act like this.

665
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:39,831
You know everyone's going wild
over your rumored suicide attempt, right?

666
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:44,961
Did you really try to kill yourself?

667
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,964
Goodness, it's not like that!

668
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,050
He took some sleeping pills
for his insomnia,

669
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:54,554
but I overreacted by bringing him here,
and now everything is a mess.

670
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:57,807
-Really?
-It really wasn't like that at all.

671
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,601
Then do a proper interview.

672
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,270
If we publish that,
it'll stop the other nonsense articles

673
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,480
and just blow over.

674
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,398
Wouldn't that be better?

675
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,568
It'd at least be better
than people gossiping about you.

676
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,530
-What should we do?
-What do you think?

677
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,741
Even if I do an interview,
it won't be with that woman!

678
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,117
Get me a different reporter!

679
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:26,253
Try to smile a little, please.

680
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,964
-Wow, now you're directing me?
-One, two…

681
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:34,261
It still looks a bit unnatural.
Try to be more natural, please.

682
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,637
One, two…

683
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,266
Are you kidding me?

684
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,226
One, two…

685
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:43,728
Okay, good.

686
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,397
Did it come out well?

687
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,690
-I guess.
-Unbelievable.

688
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:48,441
Hello?

689
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:49,401
-Wow.
-Yes.

690
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:55,073
Jeez, what the hell am I even doing?

691
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,908
There's no need to be so angry.

692
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,868
Politicians do this all the time.

693
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:00,453
Just write the article already.

694
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:02,914
I'm going to go over it word by word.

695
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,001
The gossipy tabloid articles
will get buried, thanks to me.

696
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,169
So don't test me.

697
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:11,214
"Don't test me"?

698
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:12,882
"Don't test me"?

699
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:17,345
-Are you talking to me?
-You started it.

700
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,902
Sir.

701
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,537
Say hello.
This is our newly appointed president.

702
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,249
Nice to meet you.

703
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:50,962
Are you back here for good?

704
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,214
I'm thinking about it.

705
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,176
I thought you wanted to
settle down in the US.

706
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,136
That's when I was with someone.

707
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,978
I saw your mother a few times
because of work,

708
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,064
but she didn't say a word about you.

709
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,399
She mentioned that you got a divorce.

710
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:12,776
Did I get what I deserved?

711
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,320
No.

712
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,951
I don't care
whether you got divorced or not.

713
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,833
I guess you're right.

714
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,336
It was so long ago, after all.

715
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:34,964
I need to take care of something,
so I'll get going now.

716
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,007
I need to go too.

717
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:37,759
Let me head out first.

718
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:41,888
From now on,

719
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,350
remember to
address me appropriately at work.

720
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:49,187
Yeah, of course.

721
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,857
Don't worry about a thing, sir.

722
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,955
Are you two dating again?

723
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,528
When you said you loved me

724
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,823
And accepted me

725
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:29,412
I said so confidently

726
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:33,291
That I couldn't wish for anything more

727
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,670
My desires keep growing--

728
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,215
What the heck?

729
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,219
Why were you hiding there
without making a sound?

730
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,013
I wasn't hiding.

731
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,182
It was too dark for you to see me.

732
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,311
-Why aren't you asleep at this hour?
-It's none of your business.

733
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,194
You said you collapsed from exhaustion,
but I guess that was a lie.

734
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,992
Are you sure
you didn't try to kill yourself?

735
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,170
Don't tell me

736
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:20,672
you actually tried.

737
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,798
I don't know.

738
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,052
Why do you ask?
So you can rewrite your article?

739
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:44,904
ROOFTOP GARDEN HOURS

740
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:49,409
Do you like that song?

741
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:51,953
What song?

742
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:55,665
The one you just sang.

743
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:58,918
What did I sing again?

744
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,297
Do you suffer from short-term memory loss?

745
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,843
You sang that song by Kim Dong-ryul.

746
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:08,428
Did I?

747
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,639
I sang it without thinking.

748
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:17,979
Why do you ask?

749
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,523
Because I couldn't stand
listening to you sing,

750
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:22,025
and to say never sing again.

751
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,154
My brother used to play it on repeat
until it got stuck in my head.

752
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:29,449
It's the only song I know how to sing.

753
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:35,913
What's a fake patient like you
still doing here?

754
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,874
If you're done with the article,
just go home.

755
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,208
I'm not a fake patient!

756
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,419
So you're here because you're really sick?

757
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:45,423
-It's none of your business.
-Jeez.

758
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,050
Why can't you answer my question?

759
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:48,968
Is there stuff you still need to cover?

760
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:49,886
I know!

761
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,929
"The 24-Hour Hospital Life
with Lim Hyeon-jun."

762
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,223
Imagine publishing
a series of articles like that.

763
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:57,852
Wow, how could you
just barge into someone's room and…

764
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:03,650
Hey.

765
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,568
Are you okay? What's wrong?

766
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:07,862
You're bleeding!

767
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,823
Hey!

768
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,242
Is anyone around?

769
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:21,918
Hey!

770
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,171
Hey, there are people out here!

771
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:34,430
Are you okay? Damn it.

772
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:02,458
Over here!

773
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:04,085
There's a patient here!

774
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:06,671
Is there a doctor anywhere?

775
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:12,051
One moment.

776
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:14,303
Just a moment.

777
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:22,645
Jeong-sin, are you okay?

778
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:25,898
-What's wrong with my sister?
-She…

779
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,067
She collapsed all of a sudden.

780
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:29,277
All of a sudden?

781
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,248
Doctor.

782
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:43,499
Is my sister okay?

783
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,001
-This is where she had her surgery…
-One moment.

784
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,502
We'll move her right away
for an emergency CT scan.

785
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:47,837
-Yes, ma'am.
-Let's move.

786
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,338
-Oh, no.
-Coming through!

787
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,387
LIM HYEON-JUN'S QUICK RESPONSE

788
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:57,305
LIM HYEON-JUN PERFORMS GOOD DEED

789
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,058
I was solely focused on saving her.

790
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:03,144
LIM HYEON-JUN SAVES
UNCONSCIOUS PATIENT AT HOSPITAL

791
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:07,565
This is embarrassing.
I just did what anyone would've done.

792
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,652
LIM HYEON-JUN SAVES A LIFE
"ANYONE WOULD'VE DONE THE SAME"

793
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,238
You're one lucky man, bro.

794
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:15,740
-The car is ready.
-Okay.

795
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:19,035
Thanks to this,
the suicide attempt mess got buried.

796
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,039
-So what happened to that woman?
-Who do you mean?

797
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:27,293
The reporter I carried on my back,
Wi Jeong-sin or whatever.

798
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,003
Who knows?

799
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,255
Right, I heard Mr. Bak left you a script.

800
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:32,340
How is it?

801
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,802
I swear,
he's too diligent for his own good.

802
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:38,429
Why did he write the script already?

803
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:42,183
-Oh, but the director turned it down--
-He's not doing it?

804
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:45,853
The thing is…

805
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,232
He's got another project
that he's working on.

806
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,691
So he backed out of Kang Pil-gu?

807
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,819
See? I told you!

808
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:56,531
Even the director grew sick of it
after four seasons and moved on,

809
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:57,782
so why can't I do the same?

810
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,450
Let's talk when we get there.

811
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:00,576
Come on, let's go.

812
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,287
Let's talk when we get there.

813
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,457
Ms. Wi, are you coming back
from somewhere?

814
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,502
Have you been discharged?

815
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,212
Yes.

816
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:15,424
What about you?

817
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,844
The day after tomorrow.

818
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,136
How are you…

819
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:21,973
Well…

820
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,226
You seem fine, thanks to someone.

821
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:31,023
Thank you for yesterday.

822
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:35,570
Jeez.

823
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,698
After a surgery like that,

824
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:41,450
you should've rested up
instead of writing an article.

825
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,786
No one asked you
to write an article like that.

826
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,663
It's my job.

827
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,545
Be on your way, then.

828
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,590
-Jeong-sin!
-Look, I--

829
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,473
Well, get well soon.

830
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,602
See you next time, then.

831
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,109
Over here!

832
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,029
There's a patient here! Please help her!

833
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:31,334
"Every moment I spent with you

834
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,502
was extraordinary."

835
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,046
"Because the weather was good,

836
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,714
because the weather wasn't good,

837
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,591
and because the weather was good enough,

838
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:41,135
every day was good."

839
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,386
Cut.

840
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:47,141
Seriously, that was so good.

841
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,229
Man, your acting would've brought
the Goblin to tears.

842
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,149
-Did it come out well?
-Yeah.

843
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,108
Let me see.

844
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,153
Oh, I didn't hit the record button.

845
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,449
But I did for this one here. See?

846
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,826
Good work today, bro.

847
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,496
Hey, have a drink.

848
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,336
The videos are all set.

849
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:18,464
We just need to send them
to local talent agencies.

850
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:20,007
Want me to do it?

851
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,551
Is your English good?

852
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:24,261
No.

853
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,764
But I know enough to send an email.

854
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,890
No, I'll do it.

855
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,559
You weren't going to send them, were you?

856
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,438
I can't trust you.

857
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:36,732
Fine, whatever.

858
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,235
Hey, bro.

859
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,861
Do you think this will really work?

860
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,406
We might as well just go for it.

861
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,408
Wi Jeong-sin!

862
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:46,867
Hey, Jeong-sin!

863
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:48,995
Jeong-sin!

864
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:53,457
Are you still sleeping?

865
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,627
Hey.

866
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,880
Wake up. You have a blind date today.

867
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:01,590
Damn it.

868
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,092
Look at the time.

869
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,721
And put back my clothes
once you're done wearing them!

870
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,348
-What are you wearing today?
-Clothes.

871
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:14,979
I've got my outfit planned, all right?
Don't bug me this early.

872
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,605
Seriously.

873
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:18,941
Here, look.

874
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,446
-See? I put it together.
-This?

875
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,281
This is the worst.

876
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,908
Are you going to work?
This screams "Reporter Wi Jeong-sin."

877
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,702
You'll never escape
SSB status at this rate.

878
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,162
Hey, I put some thought into it.

879
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,666
Man, all of these colors
are so depressing.

880
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,834
This won't do. Follow me.

881
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,086
Who do you think you are
ordering me around?

882
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,842
If you want this blind date to succeed,

883
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,720
you must trust me completely.

884
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:52,141
Cut. Okay, excellent acting on my part.

885
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,059
Hurry and get ready.

886
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,228
Hurry up!

887
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:58,606
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

888
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:02,109
Recommend a blind date outfit
for a man that women tend to like.

889
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:03,027
Sure.

890
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,695
Blind date outfits these days look like…

891
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:10,785
Okay.

892
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,164
Let's see here.

893
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:17,833
All right, the pants I want…

894
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:19,919
-Su-ji, what hairstyles
-Yes?

895
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,545
are popular for men these days?

896
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,130
Popular hairstyles these days look like…

897
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:27,718
I see. Something like that?

898
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:33,474
Jeez, this isn't a big deal,
so why am I nervous?

899
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,268
Maybe it's because it's been so long.

900
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:39,980
-Su-ji.
-Yes?

901
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,690
Do you think I'll do well today?

902
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:43,734
I have no doubt that you'll do well.

903
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,654
Of course, it's okay if you don't do well.

904
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:50,199
Because life always gives you
another opportunity.

905
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,327
Okay, Su-ji.

906
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,454
-I'll try my best.
-Good luck!

907
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:31,151
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

908
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,572
Smart, intellectual, and self-sufficient.

909
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:37,283
Isn't that the type you like, Hyeon-jun?

910
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:40,119
What? Why would I like that type?

911
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,745
About that reporter…

912
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,664
There's something different
about her articles now.

913
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,500
She used to be a political reporter?

914
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,003
-Wait, who?
-Lim Hyeon-jun.

915
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,297
There's hardly any information
about his private life.

916
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,632
Is it an exclusive?
Then it'll probably cause a stir.

917
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:55,301
But his family's probably in
for some rough times.

918
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,012
Mr. Lim, did you see the article
that just came out?

919
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,931
Doctor, I could really die, right?

920
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:06,979
