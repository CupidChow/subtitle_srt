1
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,334
Ms. Wi!

2
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:58,434
Ms. Wi!

3
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,270
Hello.

4
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,398
Hello.

5
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,150
What brings you here?

6
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,196
Oh, I had some business to handle.

7
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:17,036
If you're done eating,
would you like to have tea with me?

8
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:18,954
I…

9
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,335
Shall we?

10
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,590
I'll join.

11
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,763
Me too.

12
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,973
I'll join too.

13
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,554
Let's sit over here.

14
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,270
Here you go.

15
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,542
The weather is so nice today.

16
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,340
-What would you like to drink?
-I'll have an iced Americano.

17
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,467
I'll have a hot Americano.

18
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:56,427
And you, Mr. Lee?

19
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,053
He'll have peppermint tea.

20
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,472
You don't drink coffee
in the afternoon, right?

21
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,559
Yes, I'll have a peppermint tea.

22
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,810
Okay.

23
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:05,811
I'll go and order.

24
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,021
-No, I'll do it.
-I will.

25
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,607
She'd feel uncomfortable
if her boss tagged along.

26
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,735
-Go, now.
-Right.

27
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,194
I'll go instead.

28
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,195
Wait.

29
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,865
I'd feel uncomfortable with an actor too.

30
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,326
I'll go by myself.

31
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,636
I gave you the chance on a silver platter.
What more can I do for you?

32
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,805
But she said going with an actor
would be just as uncomfortable.

33
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,394
Go now.

34
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,063
Okay.

35
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,275
-Be careful.
-Thank you so much.

36
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,113
Here's your peppermint tea, Mr. Lee.

37
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,200
Me first?

38
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,284
Thank you.

39
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:09,333
Thank you.

40
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,945
The weather sure is nice.

41
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,407
You've said that so many times.

42
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,627
These flowers are called anemones.

43
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,588
I heard they symbolize hopeless love.

44
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,175
And they smell…

45
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,887
enchantingly sweet.

46
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,143
So sweet.

47
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,025
How do you know such things?

48
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,862
Because Kang Pil-gu likes flowers.

49
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,365
You really must be a fan
to know that about him.

50
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,576
Chief.

51
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,828
So please take good care of Ms. Wi.

52
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,996
Of course.

53
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,874
I'll take good care of Ms. Wi.

54
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,544
Didn't you win
the Korean Journalist of the Year award?

55
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:40,174
I'm sure you'll be fine
without anyone's help.

56
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,052
-Right?
-Yes, of course.

57
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,517
Onion!

58
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,236
Chief, do you use Onion too?

59
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,989
Of course. It's a must if you have kids.

60
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:08,243
You need it to buy and sell
barely used book sets or toys.

61
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,579
What is this "Onion"?

62
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,334
I've used Onion before.

63
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,544
Ms. Wi, have you used it before?

64
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,962
I use it pretty often.

65
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,590
What did you buy most recently?

66
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,676
Well, I got a TV for free

67
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,970
-and bought a few necessities.
-I see.

68
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,181
So what exactly is Onion?

69
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,393
It's a secondhand selling app.

70
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,728
Like an online flea market.

71
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:35,854
I see.

72
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,400
You wouldn't know
since you were born with a silver spoon.

73
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,570
There are all sorts of apps out there.

74
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,117
I hear people meet each other
through dating apps too.

75
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,537
Some meet on apps, go on dates,
and even get married.

76
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,038
Think of it as having

77
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,125
a pen pal but in modern times.

78
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,334
Some of them are jerks

79
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,711
who hide behind their screens
and toy with your emotions.

80
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,089
Tons of people do that
even after meeting in person.

81
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,465
Imagine how much worse it is online.

82
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,886
You shouldn't even think about
meeting people anonymously.

83
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,054
You're right.

84
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,013
I agree.

85
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,267
I disagree. Weird people exist everywhere.

86
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,062
It's a leap to assume
people like that exist only on apps.

87
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,899
Don't you think some of those people

88
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:24,278
have reasons they're unable to share?

89
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:25,821
Right?

90
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,322
Right.

91
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:31,285
I assume married people
who sign up and pretend to be single

92
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,495
wouldn't be able to share their stories.

93
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,581
No, even on those apps,

94
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,458
it's possible for people

95
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,460
to really like someone.

96
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:42,921
Don't you agree?

97
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,216
-Move already.
-No, you go.

98
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,426
Why do I have to go?

99
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,719
Hey, it's Kang Pil-gu.

100
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,679
-It's Kang Pil-gu!
-Let's get a photo.

101
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,056
-Sorry, sir.
-Can we get a photo?

102
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,892
-Sure, come here.
-I'm a big fan.

103
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,602
I love your show.

104
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,687
-Can I get an autograph too?
-Okay.

105
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,564
We need a record
of this historical moment.

106
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,692
One, two, three.

107
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,651
What a great photo.

108
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,448
Ms. Wi,

109
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,450
if you're going back to the office,
why don't you ride with me?

110
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,119
-I…
-Don't you have business in Gangnam?

111
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,122
Yes.

112
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,458
I'm going back to the office,
so I'll take your ride.

113
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,010
Well, I'm going to Gangnam,

114
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,428
so I'll take you there.

115
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,679
No, that's okay.

116
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,972
-It's okay.
-No, thank you.

117
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,521
No, I'm fine.

118
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,656
EPISODE 11

119
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,537
Why are you driving yourself?

120
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,873
I didn't think you'd want to

121
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,125
get behind the wheel again.

122
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,211
I can't quit driving
just because I was in an accident.

123
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,839
Yes, you can.

124
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,841
I'll drive for you.

125
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,723
Lim Hyeon-jun and Wi Jeong-sin

126
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,475
look quite good together, right?

127
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,358
Are you saying the person Ms. Wi likes

128
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,777
is Lim Hyeon-jun?

129
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,613
I didn't look into it that far,

130
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,073
but I can ask her.

131
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,324
Forget it.

132
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,827
Don't bother asking her.

133
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,464
Why does Mr. Lee keep coming on to you?

134
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,757
Come on to me?

135
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,885
Why would you
disrespect his feelings like that?

136
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,639
Are you taking his side?

137
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,141
I'm not taking his side.

138
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,435
You could've just said,
"I think he likes you."

139
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,145
Did he say he liked you?

140
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,647
Did he confess his feelings or something?

141
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,649
Don't get carried away.

142
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,028
So he did. I can tell that he did.

143
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,654
So did you return his feelings?

144
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,905
What's the matter with you?

145
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,866
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun, do you like me?

146
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,455
I like someone else.

147
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,582
And I'm still not over him.

148
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,625
There's another guy?

149
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,877
What do you mean "another"?

150
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,672
Wow, you sure are a complicated woman.

151
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,382
So complicated.

152
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,467
What are you talking about?

153
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,110
So where are you going?

154
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,321
Why did you get out?

155
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,238
What?

156
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,574
People are recognizing you. Get back in.

157
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,619
If they recognize me, then so be it.
Who cares?

158
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,371
Are you worried a rumor might break out?

159
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,581
I never said that.

160
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,501
If a rumor spreads, then be it.

161
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,002
Can't I even date at my age?

162
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,004
But we're not dating!

163
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,092
Anyway, who are you meeting today?

164
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,094
An actor? Or a singer?

165
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,931
If it's an actor, I can help you out.

166
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:21,890
It's not an actor.

167
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,726
Anyway, thank you for the ride. Goodbye.

168
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,644
Wait.

169
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,437
Ms. Wi…

170
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,565
Jeez.

171
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,695
-I'm a huge fan!
-Me too!

172
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,489
This is amazing!

173
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,534
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

174
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,453
-We love you!
-We love you!

175
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,415
-Love you!
-Thank you!

176
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,292
I'll get a 15 cm Italian BMT

177
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,128
-with the recommended combo.
-Sure.

178
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,132
By the way, is the owner here?

179
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,967
She stepped out for a minute.

180
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,760
I see. Thank you.

181
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,438
I already ate, but I can still eat this.

182
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,023
This is good.

183
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,287
Hello.

184
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,296
This sandwich is good.

185
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,132
That's good to hear.
So what brings you here?

186
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,886
I came to ask you something.

187
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,432
I recall Mr. Woo Young-suk's parents
had passed away,

188
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,435
but he did have a living older brother.

189
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,437
-Yes, that's right.
-Do you still keep in touch?

190
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,813
No, hardly.

191
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,441
We only speak when it's nearing
my husband's memorial day.

192
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,319
But he really supported us
whenever things were looking tough.

193
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,572
It sounds like the brother's well-off.

194
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,657
We started out
in similar financial situations,

195
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,160
but his restaurant business took off,
and he's doing well now.

196
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,995
I haven't been there myself, though.

197
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,584
Do you happen to know
where his restaurant is?

198
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,756
He owns a place like this in Gangnam?

199
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,219
Hello.

200
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,390
I have a quick question.

201
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,561
About that Cheongdam restaurant building
near the intersection.

202
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,230
How much is it worth?

203
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,106
-The building with the clock?
-Yes.

204
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,984
It's worth about 40 billion won,
at the very least.

205
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,111
Did you say 40 billion won?

206
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:41,488
Yes.

210
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,044
What?

211
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,797
MORTGAGE REGISTRATION

212
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,590
MORTGAGE LISTED AS ITEM 3 RELEASED

213
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,759
He bought the building entirely in cash,

214
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,803
without taking out any loans.

215
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,067
LEE DAE-HO, THE ENTERTAINMENT GIANT

216
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,324
You probably didn't know
since you were new to the political desk,

217
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,451
but there was a rumor at the time

218
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,329
that Assemblyman Ha received land
from Lee Dae-ho under a borrowed name.

219
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,549
So Lee Dae-ho bought land
under a borrowed name for Assemblyman Ha,

220
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,593
but Ha Gee-wan doesn't have any assets
under his own name.

221
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,886
His aide at the time died,

222
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,264
and the aide's older brother
suddenly became filthy rich.

223
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:52,976
What's going on?

224
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,032
-Mr. Lim?
-Huh?

225
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,742
Oh, Director Bak.

226
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,747
Where are you coming from?

227
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,207
Open the door.

228
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,878
What brings you to my studio at this hour?

229
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,046
Nothing much.

230
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,215
I was in the neighborhood,
so I just stopped by.

231
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,508
Would you like some tea?

232
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,218
No, I'm okay.

233
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,015
You see, I was wondering…

234
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,393
if you could revise the part
about Kang Pil-gu becoming corrupt

235
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,229
just a tiny bit?

236
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,982
Have you read episodes nine and ten?

237
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,776
Right, episodes nine and ten.

238
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,903
Those were fun.
You did a great job writing.

239
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,322
-Good work, so--
-That's good to hear.

240
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,324
Two more episodes to go,
and then it'll be over.

241
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,159
Well, before it ends…

242
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,118
Oh, right.

243
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,703
You know the date's been set for
our production press conference, right?

244
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,082
Oh, the date's been set
for the production press conference?

245
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,420
The production press conference?

246
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,380
Yes.

247
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,674
Wait, are you going?

248
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,591
What?

249
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,134
I'm the director,
so of course I'll be going.

250
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,969
Come on, think about it!

251
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,721
Every entertainment reporter
will be there!

252
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,724
We can't tell them not to come!
What are we going to do?

253
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:15,684
Of course, the reporters will…

254
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,019
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin!

255
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,480
That's right! Man, what do we do?

256
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,982
-Then…
-Melomaster!

257
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,568
-Yes.
-Yes.

258
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,029
Oh, right.

259
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,074
-Yes.
-I have a question, Melomaster.

260
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,037
Who's the real Melomaster?

261
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,835
No!

262
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,963
Mr. Lim, what should we do?
We need to come up with a plan.

263
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,715
Of course, we need a plan!

264
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:47,966
Hurry and think of something.

265
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,261
I've got an idea!

266
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,681
How about we hold
the production press conference

267
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,182
online instead?

268
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,475
Hey, that's a good idea.

269
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,352
Right, as if people
won't still see my face.

270
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,897
Reporters will be watching
and writing articles in real time.

271
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,441
That won't work then.

272
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,484
How about this?

273
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,319
You can disguise yourself
as an old man like last time.

274
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,654
Great idea!

275
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,072
I can't do that, Mr. Hwang.

276
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,408
That's not something
anyone should do twice!

277
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,618
Then what are we supposed to do?

278
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,370
Byeong-gi, you're a writer.

279
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,331
I'm sure you can come up
with a brilliant idea.

280
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,167
Just think of something!

281
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,127
It's hard enough writing scripts.

282
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,088
Why should I have to worry about this
on top of everything else?

283
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,716
How did I get caught up in this mess?

284
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,843
Byeong-gi, you can do this.

285
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,012
Just squeeze something out.

286
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,555
How about a twin concept?

287
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,557
What?

288
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,603
I told her my name was Bak Jun-gi
that night at the N Seoul Tower.

289
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,521
Bak Byeong-gi and Bak Jun-gi.

290
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,940
If I get caught,
I'll tell her that he's my twin brother.

291
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,358
That sounds like a plan, right?

292
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,527
Hey, Director Bak!

293
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,321
You're a damn genius!

294
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,572
-Right?
-Yes!

295
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,700
This is it!

296
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,785
Hey!

297
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,622
If you do that,
you two will end up on the news.

298
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,290
How will you deal with the aftermath?

299
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,666
She's a reporter.

300
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,919
If you mess with her, she'll destroy you!

301
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,797
He's got a point there.

302
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,424
Yes, he does.
I think I lost my mind for a second.

303
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,344
It won't work, Mr. Lim.

304
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,888
Then what are we supposed to do?

305
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,685
Director Bak.

306
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,562
What is it?

307
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,731
At first glance,

308
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:30,902
fame might appear to be a good thing,

309
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,279
but once your face becomes known,

310
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,406
your private life is over.

311
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,408
You know what I mean, Director Bak.

312
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,453
I can't enjoy a meal in peace
when I'm out.

313
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,331
What does that have to do
with the production press release?

314
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,625
I'm just saying

315
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,087
that it's best to be rich
and not be famous.

316
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,923
Stop beating around the bush
and just say it.

317
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,967
You don't want him
to attend the press conference.

318
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,469
No, that's not it.

319
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:00,056
I'm just saying
that instead of being somewhat famous,

320
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,976
keeping a mysterious image

321
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,232
and remaining a veiled, genius director

322
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,028
may be an option for you.

323
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,905
Mr. Lim, you're so selfish.

324
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,324
Are you trying to block my career
because of your love life?

325
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,160
I don't want to be forced
to stay an unveiled director.

326
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,706
Who said anything
about blocking your career?

327
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,791
You got it all wrong.

328
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,294
Wait.

329
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,007
What if we don't hold
a production press conference at all?

330
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,925
Huh?

331
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,468
I pray that we don't.

332
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,931
Why do we have to do it
in the first place?

333
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,601
There's nothing wrong with not doing it.

334
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:15,006
These flowers are called anemones.

335
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,593
I heard they symbolize hopeless love.

336
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,264
And they smell enchantingly sweet.

337
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,061
Why am I here?

338
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,899
What?

339
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,526
What the heck was that dream?

340
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,362
What was that about?

341
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:38,821
That was so weird.

342
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,701
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun, do you like me?

343
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,206
I'll take good care of Ms. Wi.

344
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,999
Are you worried a rumor might break out?

345
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,877
If a rumor spreads, then be it.

346
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,921
Can't I even date at my age?

347
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,840
And they smell enchantingly sweet.

348
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,890
I'm late.

349
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,394
Gosh, this is a pretty hearty lunch.

350
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,688
There's chicken, rice, and salad.

351
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,772
It's pretty well-rounded.

352
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:13,898
This is good.

353
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,943
Yes, I'll be a bit more careful.

354
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,361
All right, goodbye.

355
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,615
How much longer
do I have to put up with this?

356
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,908
What is it?

357
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,785
I wrote about the markup
on idol photo cards,

358
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,578
and got told off
for ruining the idol singer's image.

359
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,832
It's their gimmick
that ruined their public image, not me.

360
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,458
At least the PR team says it nicely.

361
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,544
I recently wrote an article about a drama

362
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,671
and got tons of hateful messages
from the actors' fans,

363
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,256
filled with nasty swear words.

364
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,383
Getting cursed at is part of being
an entertainment reporter.

365
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,176
Getting cursed at is one thing.

366
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,054
But when I write about
a celebrity scandal or suicide,

367
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,891
I'm shocked at how I write it up
like it's not a big deal.

368
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,020
Well, if it's that difficult for you,

369
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,230
you could move
to a different department or media outlet.

370
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,566
Why stay here?

371
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,485
I loved watching movies and dramas
since I was a kid.

372
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,363
Enjoying good media content as a viewer

373
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:06,325
isn't the same
as stepping into that world as a reporter.

374
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,828
And it may seem like
we only write gossip pieces,

375
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,830
but there are celebrities
who reach out to thank us.

376
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,833
Gratitude like that
is what keeps us going.

377
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,544
I could ask you the same question.

378
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,212
I thought you'd leave at the first chance.

379
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,215
Well, I…

380
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,804
I'm not sure.

381
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,139
What did you say?

382
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,390
What I'm saying is,

383
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,894
instead of sending Ms. Wi
to the Kang Pil-gu press conference,

384
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,772
would you mind sending
a different reporter?

385
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,524
You called me all this way
just to ask me that?

386
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,236
Circumstances came up, you see.

387
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,571
When you ask a favor,

388
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,407
you should explain
the circumstances first.

389
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,284
Why are you so uptight?

390
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,535
Consider how serious things must be

391
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,371
for me, Lim Hyeon-jun,
to ask you this favor in person.

392
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,165
There's no need to get emotional.

393
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:55,833
Just explain it

394
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,252
so that it makes sense to me.

395
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,427
Well, something happened.

396
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,387
It's too complicated…

397
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,848
It's too complicated to explain.

398
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,477
The truth is…

399
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,312
This seems good enough to submit.

400
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,772
Nice. Thank you.

401
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,488
I hear you're doing an amazing job
here at the entertainment desk.

402
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,697
Word has gotten around.

403
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,868
I'm pretty exceptional, after all.

404
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,746
So what brings you here all of a sudden?

405
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,375
You're not here to ask me
to return to the political desk,

406
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:38,960
are you?

407
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,128
Actually, you're right.

408
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,839
Really?
I'm returning to the political desk?

409
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,006
Yes.

410
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,924
But first,

411
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,011
you need to destroy
all the videos you have,

412
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,054
as if they never existed.

413
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,348
You did what?

414
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,558
-Onion.
-Onion!

415
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,060
-Onion.
-Onion!

416
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,021
Oh, that Onion.

417
00:23:59,105 --> 00:23:59,939
Yes.

418
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:03,776
So the secondhand selling app
you said you've used before…

419
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,820
Yes, that's right.

420
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,031
I sold a rice cooker to Ms. Wi.

421
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,827
Then the reason why Ms. Wi
looked strangely excited that day--

422
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,204
Yes. She came out to meet me,

423
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:16,914
but I'm not the one she met.

424
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,583
I had someone else go in my place.

425
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,553
I can't believe you did that on Onion.

426
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:36,851
Oh, gosh.

427
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,271
Seriously?

428
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,323
Mr. Lim, it's a shame
to hear about your predicament,

429
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,449
but there's no way around it.

430
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,493
Regardless of whether
Ms. Wi attends the press conference,

431
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,162
she'll see the photos taken there.

432
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,830
Then what am I supposed to do?

433
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,458
You and I agreed to team up,

434
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,544
so you should suggest a solution
in a crisis like this.

435
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:06,005
Imagine if Ms. Wi finds out I lied to her.

436
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,174
Knowing her personality,
she won't stand for it.

437
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,800
She'll swear never to see me again.

438
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:15,056
If you get caught
trying to cover up this situation,

439
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,265
it'll make things worse.

440
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,310
Just tell her the truth.

441
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,564
Why are you saying things
that don't help at all?

442
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:24,941
That's not a solution!

443
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,278
I want to

444
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,156
stay at Sports Eunseong a bit longer.

445
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,575
You're turning down
the investigative journalism team?

446
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,577
But why?

447
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,121
Don't tell me
you're still pursuing that case.

448
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,999
No, it's not that.

449
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:47,505
The entertainment desk has grown on me,
and it's been rewarding.

450
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,131
Rewarding? Listen, you punk.

451
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,926
They make you write up
30 to 40 articles a day here.

452
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,638
Well, sometimes I get a dose of reality.

453
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,393
But even if it's an article
that'll be forgotten overnight,

454
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,437
there are readers out there

455
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,440
who still want it and enjoy it.

456
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,986
More than that, I feel more at peace
than I did at the political desk.

457
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,029
So I'll stick around a little longer.

458
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,198
I appreciate the offer you made.

459
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,075
I'm sorry, Chief.

460
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,798
-Yes?
-Hello, sir. It's me.

461
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,968
I don't think we can get Ms. Wi to return.

462
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,845
Why? Did she refuse the offer?

463
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,680
Yes, sir.

464
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,725
My apologies, sir.

465
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,643
I trust you'll take care of that reporter.

466
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,562
Stop her from causing more trouble.

467
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,522
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

468
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,277
I'm going to lose my mind.

469
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,155
What if I end up
taking the hit from all this?

470
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,948
Wi Jeong-sin, that punk!

471
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,079
These clothes aren't really my style.

472
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,207
Let's check out that place.

473
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,500
-That one?
-Yeah.

474
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,264
PRICE: 1,860,000 WON

475
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,224
One million eight hundred…

476
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,770
Jeong-sin, it's way too expensive here.

477
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:26,854
Let's go somewhere else.

478
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,190
Hey, don't be a chicken
and just choose one.

479
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,109
Look at the price of this
before telling me not to chicken out.

480
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,404
Choose one while I'm offering.
This is a rare opportunity.

481
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,283
Then can I get this?

482
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,577
-This one?
-Yes.

483
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,496
Let's take a look.

484
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,291
-It looks nice.
-And it's the perfect size.

485
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,417
I knew you wanted it.

486
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,508
Do you offer a 12-month payment plan?

487
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,759
Yes.

488
00:27:58,636 --> 00:27:59,595
Thanks for this.

489
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,683
You probably spent
about a month's paycheck.

490
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:05,810
Are you sure this is okay?

491
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,603
Of course. That's why I got it for you.

492
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:11,273
You always nag me whenever I spend money.

493
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,400
Why splurge today?

494
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,778
It's not like I didn't want to get you

495
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,030
nice clothes and shoes
at a place like this.

496
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:21,075
We have no parents or relatives
who would give us money.

497
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,160
I don't want to ask anyone for help,

498
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,871
so I just have to cut back a bit.

499
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,374
Be good to me, you brat!

500
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,292
Yes, ma'am.

501
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,379
Here, have a drink.

502
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,261
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

503
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,226
It seems like only yesterday
that you were a kid.

504
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,521
Now look at us, drinking together.
How touching.

505
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,565
Jeez, stop being so dramatic.

506
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:56,444
Hey, do you remember
how I was a high school senior

507
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,028
when you started elementary school?

508
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,697
You'll never imagine
how hectic it was for me.

509
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,285
Yet I still got into Hankuk University.
Aren't you proud of your big sister?

510
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,871
Wow, you never fail
to turn things into a brag about yourself.

511
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:08,998
Oh, right.

512
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,833
-The press conference is tomorrow, right?
-Yeah.

513
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:12,877
Are you attending?

514
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,253
No, I'm not part of that.

515
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,715
I wonder when I'll get to attend.

516
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,884
Learn from me and work hard.

517
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,302
Your day will come then.

518
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:22,636
Sure.

519
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,474
By the way, is it over with that guy
you were flirting with?

520
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,058
What are you talking about?

521
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:32,271
Remember the bro at work
who handed you the gimbap?

522
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,981
Why do you call every guy "bro"?

523
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,942
He's the president of our company!

524
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,027
The president?

525
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,863
That young, handsome guy is the president?

526
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:41,947
Holy cow.

527
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,284
You must be lucky with guys.

528
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,786
Jeong-sin, make things work this time.

529
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,288
That bro is definitely into you.

530
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,372
I'm positive.

531
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,334
It's not like that. Just eat!

532
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,129
Why do you always hit me?

533
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,842
Doesn't that mean I have a chance?

534
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:05,596
Forget about that guy already
and come to me.

535
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,098
I'm right here in front of you.

536
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,433
I've always been here for you.

537
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,062
And I'm still waiting for you.

538
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,427
Seeing that you asked me out for tea,

539
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,097
I'm getting a bad feeling.

540
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,186
I wanted to return
the umbrella you lent me.

541
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,241
I used this as an excuse to see you,

542
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,743
but I actually need to tell you something.

543
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,456
Mr. Lee, I can't return your feelings.

544
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,718
I expected as much on my way here.

545
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,387
I'm sorry.

546
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,642
I think you should take a moment…

547
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,979
to think about how you really feel.

548
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,108
Was it really me you liked?

549
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,152
Or was it someone

550
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,946
I reminded you of?

551
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:18,562
I think you should take a moment
to think about how you really feel.

552
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,981
Was it really me you liked?

553
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,983
Or was it someone

554
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:25,861
I reminded you of?

555
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,239
I always felt like

556
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:32,451
you were looking for someone else in me.

557
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,789
At the end of your gaze,

558
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,917
it was always the chief.

559
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,002
As if…

560
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:44,963
she were a child

561
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,925
you left behind and couldn't forget.

562
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,668
Mr. Lim, it's a shame
to hear about your predicament,

563
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:23,836
but there's no way around it.

564
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,630
Regardless of whether
Ms. Wi attends the press conference,

565
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:28,632
she'll see the photos taken there.

566
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:34,962
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

567
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:36,598
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

568
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,517
PRODUCTION PRESS CONFERENCE

569
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,939
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

570
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:51,530
FACING THE ABYSS AT JUSTICE'S EDGE…
WILL IT BE CORRUPTION OR COVER-UP?

571
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,129
WE WILL FOREVER SUPPORT
ACTOR LIM HYEON-JUN

572
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,241
Bro!

573
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,535
She's here. Ms. Wi is here!

574
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,662
We're in so much trouble!

575
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,791
I told her so many times
not to send Ms. Wi!

576
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,834
Now isn't the time for this.
You can't give up.

577
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,295
Bro, you can't have another panic attack.

578
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,963
Seriously, why isn't
another panic attack coming?

579
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,381
That came out wrong.

580
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,842
Seriously, why isn't Byeong-gi coming?

581
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,219
What are we going to do?

582
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,595
Hello.

583
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,680
-Hey, Director Bak!
-Byeong-gi!

584
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,516
Ms. Wi is here!

585
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,683
What should we do?

586
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,686
I'm dressed totally differently
from when I met Ms. Wi that day.

587
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,813
Will that be enough?

588
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:06,730
Yes!

589
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,357
She didn't suspect anything
when I met her,

590
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,733
which means she's not observant.

591
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,694
-But…
-As if she'll fall for this.

592
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,363
Director Bak, what's wrong?

593
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,531
I'm okay.

594
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,825
Mr. Lim, we have to get going now.

595
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,493
I'm about to lose it.

596
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,786
What are we going to do?

597
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,955
What else can we do? Let's go.

598
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,749
-Seriously, I can't deal with this!
-Oh, man.

599
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,006
Hey, this is a great idea!

600
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,924
Gosh.

601
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,135
-Byeong-gi?
-Director Bak!

602
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,804
He's breaking out in a cold sweat.

603
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,181
Hey, what's wrong?

604
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,558
-Where does it hurt?
-I can't…

605
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,476
All right, it's time for the photocall.

606
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,436
"They say you can't fix people."

607
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,063
"But I do."

608
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,483
No one delivers this line
better than the actor himself.

609
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,361
First up is the star
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,

610
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,154
actor Lim Hyeon-jun!

611
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,364
Please come to the stage.

612
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:00,951
Hello.

613
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,788
-Please look over here!
-Over here!

614
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,665
Thank you for coming.

615
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,376
Wow, cameras are flashing everywhere.

616
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,378
Mr. Lim, you look amazing today.

617
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,714
Keep looking amazing,
and please look straight ahead.

618
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,467
Now look to the left and right.

619
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,929
Mr. Lim, can you lift up your hand more
and make a heart for us?

620
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:22,431
Sure.

621
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,515
Very nice.

622
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,393
-Great!
-Look here, please!

623
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,020
We'll see lots of great shots from today.

624
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,397
-Over here, please!
-Please look over here!

625
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,524
-Look this way!
-Now a heart with your right hand, please.

626
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,110
-Please look here!
-Over here too!

627
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,111
Very nice!

628
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,157
Wow, he's the best at fan service.

629
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,700
That was great. Thank you.

630
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,869
Now, could you wait to the side
for a moment?

631
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,371
We'll continue the photocall
with the beautiful Ms. Gwon Se-na,

632
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,540
who has joined the cast for season five.

633
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,125
Ms. Gwon Se-na, please come out.

634
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,922
Please look over here!

635
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,257
You look beautiful!

636
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,553
Look at all these camera flashes!

637
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,305
Please make a heart with your hands!

638
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,766
-Make a heart, please!
-Look over here!

639
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,684
Let's try some different poses, please.

640
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,186
She has the most charming smile.

641
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,480
Please direct your gaze at the cameras.

642
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,691
She's making all sorts of hearts for us.

643
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,735
This is it for individual photos.

644
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,738
Next, we'll move on
to the joint photocall.

645
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:20,822
Okay.

646
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,576
Make sure you get a good shot. Zoom in.

647
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,954
-Stand closer together, please!
-Closer together!

648
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,999
You're standing a little too far apart.
Please move closer together.

649
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,584
-Shall we?
-Yes, please.

650
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:36,672
Look here, please!

651
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,927
How about making a heart with your hands?

652
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,555
Here's a heart.

653
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,307
A heart!

654
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,434
A heart.

655
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,313
I think we'd like to see more fun hearts.

656
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,940
It's a heart!

657
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,025
A heart!

658
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:58,902
-A heart!
-A heart.

659
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,321
Here's a heart.

660
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,410
"LIM HYEON-JUN,
A WARM SMILE BEHIND THE COLD EYES"

661
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,828
I've never seen a heart like that.

662
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,330
-Over here, please!
-To the right!

663
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,666
"LIM HYEON-JUN REJECTS GWON SE-NA'S HEART
HEARTS ARE DIY"

664
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,668
Thank you so much!

665
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,296
Let me begin by asking the reporters
for their understanding.

666
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,008
Director Bak Byeong-gi,
who was scheduled to attend today,

667
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:24,177
was unfortunately unable to join us
due to health reasons.

668
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,762
We appreciate your understanding.

669
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,016
-He got severe indigestion.
-I see.

670
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,892
Let's change the subject

671
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,228
-and continue by interviewing the actors.
-Yes.

672
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,522
I see a lot of reporters are here today.

673
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,941
Please raise your hand
if you have a question,

674
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,068
and the actors will answer it.

675
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,196
Please pass the mic
to the one in the sky blue shirt.

676
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:47,409
Ms. Gwon Se-na,
what can we look forward to

677
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,661
in season five
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu?

678
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:51,788
Well, unlike Pil-gu,

679
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:55,042
I-su relies on solid evidence
when conducting investigations,

680
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,668
so they're always at odds.

681
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,547
I think their teamwork and chemistry
when solving cases together

682
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,965
is something to look forward to.

683
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:04,384
We look forward to seeing that chemistry.

684
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,094
What sets season five apart

685
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,889
from the previous seasons of Kang Pil-gu?

686
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,808
In this season,

687
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:14,978
you'll witness Pil-gu's downfall
as a corrupt detective

688
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:18,190
and the tormented human side
of Kang Pil-gu.

689
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:21,943
Make sure to tune into the drama
to check out these parts.

690
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,820
I have a question for Mr. Lim.

691
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,405
I heard you opened

692
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,909
the Kang Pil-gu 5 set
exclusively for Sports Eunseong.

693
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,578
-Is this true?
-Is that true?

694
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,206
Seriously? Why only Sports Eunseong?

695
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,123
That's so unfair.

696
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,249
We're reporters too.

697
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,086
No, of course not.

698
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,380
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

699
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:46,635
What happened was
that we had planned to give

700
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:52,682
each media outlet
individual access to our set.

701
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,267
Right.

702
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,437
-That's right.
-So we decided to draw straws.

703
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:02,442
And Sports Eunseong
happened to be picked first.

704
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,402
Man, Sports Eunseong is so lucky.

705
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,072
We plan to invite every reporter on set

706
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,491
before we finish shooting the drama,

707
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,160
so we'd appreciate it
if you could wait a bit longer.

708
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,329
So they were going to invite everyone.

709
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:15,831
Yes.

710
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,834
Yes, please be patient.
Meanwhile, we'll take more questions.

711
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,502
The reporter in the back?

712
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,713
I have a question
for both Mr. Lim and Ms. Gwon.

713
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:27,217
Is there a romantic storyline
between you two in season five?

714
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,635
-No, there isn't--
-Keep an eye out for it!

715
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,183
I'm assuming
there's nothing in the beginning,

716
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,685
but it develops later on?

717
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,354
-No--
-Many viewers

718
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,107
have been curious
about Kang Pil-gu's romantic side.

719
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,862
The writer is working on a script
that will meet everyone's expectations,

720
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,280
so you can look forward to it.

721
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:53,660
Do we finally get to see Kang Pil-gu
in a relationship, then?

722
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,413
Well…

723
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,960
Yes, Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong!

724
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:03,962
-Me?
-Yes.

725
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,007
You held your hand up like this.

726
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,051
What's your question?

727
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,349
Well,

728
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,144
I'm less interested in
Kang Pil-gu's romantic storyline.

729
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,772
Rather, I'd like to hear how you portrayed
both the righteous Kang Pil-gu

730
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:26,026
and the corrupt detective Kang Pil-gu,
a character who is both good and evil.

731
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,570
I would like to ask about
the effort it took to play that duality.

732
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,113
Thank you.

733
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:32,908
As I said before,

734
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,120
you'll be able to witness

735
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,456
the tormented human side of Kang Pil-gu.

736
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:58,975
Hello?

737
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,518
Hello, Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

738
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,648
Hello, Mr. Kim Dong-jun.

739
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,274
How are you doing?

740
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:07,734
I'm calling to give you an exclusive.

741
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,653
An exclusive?

742
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,613
I'm working on a new project.

743
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,075
I said you'd be the first person
I'd contact, remember?

744
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,204
So, this is you keeping your promise?

745
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,413
Thank you so much.

746
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:21,998
I look forward to the exclusive interview.

747
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:24,668
Of course. I'm an expert at interviewing.

748
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,088
Right.

749
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:31,549
My manager will get in touch with you
about the time and location.

750
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,802
Thank you. I'll be waiting, then.

751
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:34,719
Goodbye.

752
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,604
So we can't avoid the surge
in production costs,

753
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,440
but a transparent revenue structure
could resolve this.

754
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,401
Sounds good.

755
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,862
Chief, the next agenda is…

756
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:53,947
Just a moment.

757
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,702
Yes, hello.

758
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:02,956
Excuse me?

759
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,376
How badly is he hurt?

760
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,629
Which hospital?

761
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,506
Yes.

762
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,245
Damn it.

763
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,333
Let's take my car.

764
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,294
You can't drive in this state.

765
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:06,936
What's your kid's name?

766
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:08,563
Jae-ha.

767
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,274
Yun Jae-ha.

768
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:17,489
I think you should take a moment
to think about how you really feel.

769
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,949
At the end of your gaze,

770
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,286
it was always the chief.

771
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:41,763
Yes?

772
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:46,142
Goodness, Director Bak.

773
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,230
You must've been under a lot of stress.

774
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,274
What did the doctor say?

775
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,861
It's just stomach cramps and exhaustion.

776
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,905
I'm getting IV fluids
and taking the day off.

777
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:02,075
-Oh, man.
-How'd the production press conference go?

778
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,577
Yes, thanks to you…
No, that's not what I mean.

779
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:07,038
It went well enough.

780
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,624
-I guess it was thanks to me.
-Come on.

781
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,043
Thanks to my timely collapse,

782
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,837
you escaped a crisis.

783
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,757
Come on, don't say that.
You're making me feel bad.

784
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:19,801
Mr. Lim.

785
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,095
Yes? What is it?

786
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:24,264
I can't keep hiding like this.

787
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,770
Yeah, I know.

788
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,274
Today, we got lucky…

789
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,319
I don't know
if "lucky" is even the right word.

790
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:41,322
In any case,
we got through today because I collapsed.

791
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,825
But there's no guarantee
we won't get caught later.

792
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,743
My face could get on
the behind-the-scenes footage.

793
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,412
I agree with you.

794
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,958
I wasn't sure if I should tell you this,

795
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,252
but I think it's best that you know.

796
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,712
What is it?

797
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,840
The truth is, Ms. Wi…

798
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,634
Yes?

799
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:04,095
I don't think she likes the real you.

800
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,013
What?

801
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:10,101
To tell you the truth,
she told me something the night I met her.

802
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:11,853
The one I fell for

803
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,189
was Detective Kang Pil-gu,
driven by justice,

804
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,816
not the actor Lim Hyeon-jun.

805
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,616
Not Lim Hyeon-jun, but Kang Pil-gu.

806
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,744
She said she only likes Kang Pil-gu,

807
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,871
the character I created.

808
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,290
No…

809
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:36,294
No, that's not possible.

810
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:42,217
You've been under a lot of stress
because people see you and Kang Pil-gu

811
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,968
as the same person.

812
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,597
I think Ms. Wi was confused
for a moment too.

813
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,849
She liked Kang Pil-gu as a fan,

814
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:53,019
but she liked Melomaster
in a romantic way.

815
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:55,647
That's what I think.

816
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:03,988
Then what about me?

817
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:08,576
She only liked Kang Pil-gu…

818
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:12,747
and Melomaster from Onion?

819
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,584
She never had feelings for Lim Hyeon-jun?

820
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,587
It may be hard to accept,

821
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,131
but that's how it seems.

822
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,803
Do you like Lim Hyeon-jun?

823
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,013
Yes, I do.

824
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,307
It's the first time in my life.

825
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,641
I've never liked someone…

826
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,270
so unconditionally.

827
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:19,480
He was really cool, of course.

828
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,274
He's manly,

829
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,276
yet still has that boyish charm.

830
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:26,571
You can be old and still be cool.

831
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,824
Everyone has their own kind of charm
that suits their age.

832
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:33,077
I think Ms. Wi was confused
for a moment too.

833
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,955
She liked Kang Pil-gu as a fan,

834
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,043
but she liked Melomaster
in a romantic way.

835
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,295
That's what I think.

836
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,175
That's not true!

837
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,135
Wi Jeong-sin definitely liked the real me!

838
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,386
Without a doubt.

839
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,805
It's ridiculous to cater to every tantrum

840
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:54,349
of a middle-aged man acting like a diva!

841
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,310
The second you think you're special,
that's when trouble starts.

842
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,481
I can destroy you
with nothing more than my writing.

843
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:02,732
I don't want…

844
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:04,776
your apology.

845
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,070
Was I wrong?

846
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,702
I like someone else.

847
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,372
And I'm still not over him.

848
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,168
I don't know.

849
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,586
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

850
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,672
What is it that women want?

851
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,134
It's so complicated.

852
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,553
Sure. I'll play the song you requested.

853
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:33,971
What are you saying?

854
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,688
"NASTY MAN"

855
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,997
YOU MADE ME CRY LIKE SAD MUSIC
AND LEFT ME FOR A FARAWAY PLACE

856
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:07,296
The lyrics are just spot on.

857
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:12,343
IS IT REGRET
THAT LEFT BRUISES ON MY HEART?

858
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:15,763
YOU ONLY GAVE ME PAIN AND LEFT ME

859
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:20,268
I GAVE YOU MY HEART, MY LOVE, MY ALL

860
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,563
BUT NOW YOU'RE LEAVING, LIKE A STRANGER

861
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,483
Take the pain of goodbye with you

862
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:30,445
Oh

00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,114

00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,124
HEARTLESS LOVE

891
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,750
Is the rice cooker still available?

892
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:10,813
Onion!

893
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:15,735
Yes, it is.

894
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:19,697
Does the rice cooker…

895
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,241
Does the rice cooker work well?

896
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:24,160
Yes, it works fine.

897
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:25,369
If you don't mind me asking,

898
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:28,623
if it works fine,

899
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,458
why are you selling it?

900
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,542
Why does it matter?

901
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,795
What kind of question is that?

902
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:42,261
We're a family of two,
so the rice cooker is too big for us.

903
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:43,721
It's not a good fit for our home.

904
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,682
"It's not a good fit"?

905
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,143
It's not a good fit for your home?

906
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,814
Still, isn't it better to have

907
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,566
a nice, big one?

908
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:59,654
Seriously? Then why don't you buy it?

909
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:10,581
Okay.

910
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:12,959
For a quick and easy deal,
I'll give you a 10,000 won discount.

911
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,126
Thank you.

912
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,381
Could I pick it up tomorrow evening?

913
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,174
Yes, that's fine.

914
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,676
Are you okay with a doorstep pickup?

915
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,636
No, I'm not.

916
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,681
I want to buy it in person.

917
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:30,017
Man, what a hassle.

918
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,857
Could you let me know
a time and place that works for you?

919
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,202
I think Ms. Wi was confused
for a moment too.

920
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,621
She liked Kang Pil-gu as a fan,

921
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:54,542
but she liked Melomaster
in a romantic way.

922
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,293
-That's what I think.
-Mr. Lim.

923
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,462
-Yeah?
-We need to get ready.

924
00:54:58,546 --> 00:54:59,505
Right.

925
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:15,646
Okay.

926
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,232
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

927
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,275
I'm heading out.

928
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,693
Be safe.

929
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,654
What's my horoscope for today?

930
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:27,074
Your horoscope says
you should have a smooth day overall.

931
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:29,994
However, unexpected events may arise,

932
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,455
so it would be best to handle them calmly.

933
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,082
Right, calmly.

934
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,503
I can't keep hiding like this.

935
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,172
Just tell her the truth.

936
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,049
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

937
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,552
Can you give me
some words of encouragement?

938
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,137
No one can predict the outcome,

939
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,432
but you won't leave any regrets
as long as you try your best.

940
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,018
Jeez, more pointless remarks.

941
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,937
Still, I feel encouraged.

942
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,230
Thank you for the compliment.

943
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,358
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun, do you like me?

944
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:08,866
Goodbye, bro.

945
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,955
We didn't even use it much,
so why are you selling it?

946
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,165
It's too big.

947
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,417
We don't need such a big rice cooker.

948
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,252
It's not like we cook at home a lot.

949
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:22,129
Then why'd you even buy it?

950
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,049
Well, I guess I wasn't thinking straight!

951
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:28,803
Hey.

952
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,138
Can you wear the sneakers
your ex-girlfriend bought for you?

953
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:33,599
Yeah, of course.
The sneakers aren't to blame.

954
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:34,517
But how?

955
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,228
You'd be reminded of her
every time you wear them.

956
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,312
It's human nature to forget.

957
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,315
It's hard at first,
but it fades away after a while.

958
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,150
Bad feelings are temporary,

959
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:44,735
but objects last forever.

960
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,532
You're only smart in situations like this.

961
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:51,200
-Out of my way!
-Sure.

962
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,578
It's raining. Want me to go instead?

963
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:55,579
Forget it.

964
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:02,461
What's taking them so long?
It's still raining.

965
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,216
SEONGIL STATION

966
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:19,145
I'm here. Are you running late?

967
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,691
-Soulishere?
-What?

968
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:45,546
What's happening?

969
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,089
-For Onion, right?
-What?

970
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,091
You came to sell the rice cooker.

971
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,804
Wait, how did you know?

972
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:56,473
-Why are you selling it anyway?
-What?

973
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:57,516
Are you getting rid of it

974
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,894
because things didn't work out
with Melomaster?

975
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,693
You have no idea what's going on, do you?

976
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:09,737
It was me,

977
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:11,614
Melomaster.

978
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,451
I was Melomaster,

979
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:16,619
and Melomaster

980
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:18,871
was me.

981
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,501
You asked me if I liked you.

982
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,173
Yes.

983
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,344
I like you.

984
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:21,558
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

985
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,896
How could something like this happen?

986
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,648
How can this all be a coincidence?

987
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,275
Take your time to think about it.

988
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:31,360
I can wait as long as you need.

989
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:34,822
I've never felt like
such an idiot in my life.

990
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,992
From now on, I'll message you
instead of using the Onion app.

991
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:38,909
Sweet dreams.

992
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:41,078
I like you.

993
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,955
I'm so pissed that I got fooled,

994
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,290
but I can't stop thinking about him!

995
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,207
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

996
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:48,335
Hello?

997
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:49,336
I want to see you.

998
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:50,879
What?
