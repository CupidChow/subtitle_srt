1
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:52,928
You've been curious, haven't you?

2
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,183
About why I left the US
so suddenly back then.

3
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,561
I'm going back to Korea.

4
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,397
I'm sorry that I'm leaving
when you're like this.

5
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,232
Forget about everything
and focus on your treatment.

6
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,201
You're finally going to explain?

7
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,873
It's a long story
and worse than you could ever imagine.

8
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,250
So prepare yourself
for what I'm about to tell you.

9
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:25,836
Seven years ago,

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,089
I discovered that a US fund company
backed by a Korean asset management firm

11
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,759
was having financial troubles.

12
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,595
And one of its top investors

13
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,555
was your brother.

14
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:37,473
My brother?

15
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,433
Yes,

16
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:41,310
your brother.

17
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,521
Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

18
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,942
When he found out
I was investigating the firm,

19
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,401
he showed up and threatened me.

20
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,320
And early that morning…

21
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,366
you got into that accident.

22
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,537
Are you suggesting that the person
who caused the accident…

23
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,663
It was your brother.

24
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,543
I was scared.

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,127
If I wrote the article,

26
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,589
I felt he might actually kill you
when you barely survived the accident.

27
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,967
That's why I left you.

28
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,470
Your brother

29
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,515
has done far too many terrible things.

30
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,058
He even harmed people.

31
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,435
I'm sorry, but…

32
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,439
I can't hear any more of this.

33
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,321
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

34
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:17,990
We've met before.

35
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,745
You've ignored my meeting requests,
but here you are now.

36
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,289
I only respond to requests
from those at a level worthy of my time.

37
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,166
But you keep crossing the line,

38
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,169
so I had to take precious time
out of my schedule for this.

39
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,629
Why aren't you firing me?

40
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,381
Fire you?

41
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,928
If this problem were that simple,
I wouldn't have had to step in.

42
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,305
I either make people give up

43
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,600
or simply eliminate them.

44
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,726
That's how I do things.

45
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,019
Is that a threat?

46
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,020
It's advice.

47
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,440
Consider it advice
given out of concern for you.

48
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,112
There must be numbers of people
you simply eliminated.

49
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,162
I suggest you stop
what you're doing right now.

50
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,498
It won't end well for you if you continue.

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,922
You're wasting your time.

52
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,005
I won't give up.

53
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,052
Fine, then.

54
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,808
Now that I know where you stand,

55
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,269
I'll have to take matters
into my own hands.

56
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,150
What a crazy bastard!

57
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,444
Damn.

58
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,515
Are you sure you can handle it?

59
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,879
EPISODE 14

60
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,263
Wi Jeong-sin is the only person
who can stop your brother.

61
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,558
So I need your help
getting her article published,

62
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,647
in Sports Eunseong.

63
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,565
Please.

64
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,323
Huh?

65
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,909
Hey, this door is locked too!

66
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:50,828
What?

67
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,122
Are you sure you got the right schedule?

68
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,082
Call the assistant director.

69
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,168
We're supposed to be on set by 6:30 p.m.

70
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,839
The person you are trying to reach…

71
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:02,840
He's not answering.

72
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,469
What the hell is going on?

73
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,027
Hello? Yeah.

74
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,407
Really?

75
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,577
All right. Thanks, Gil-su.

76
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,578
Head home.

77
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,954
-What did he say?
-Oh.

78
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,456
Well…

79
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,917
He went to the production office
and knocked,

80
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:39,835
but no one was there.

81
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,546
And all the lights were off
in the director's studio.

82
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,131
You've got to be kidding me.

83
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,716
They're unbelievable.

84
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,758
Those jerks!

85
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,969
Hey, Hyeon-jun.

86
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,554
Let's calm down.

87
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,347
How can I calm down?

88
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:56,894
He begged me to take this role, so I did!

89
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,730
And now the director himself
gangs up with the crew to ostracize me?

90
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,900
Mr. Hwang, go tell Byeong-gi and Mr. Son

91
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,235
that I'm not filming
until I get an apology!

92
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,278
Come on, bro.

93
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,446
Go tell them right now!

94
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,457
Man, how am I supposed to tell them
when there's nobody there?

95
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,265
Huh?

96
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,934
And all the lights were off
in the director's studio.

97
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,140
Gosh, how many years has it been?

98
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,185
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

99
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,065
Hello, my precious trophy.
It's been a while.

100
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,276
How have you been?

101
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,528
Ready. Action!

102
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,154
Cut!

103
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,114
-Don't stop.
-Action!

104
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,992
-Keep acting until I say cut.
-Action!

105
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,411
Mr. Lim, let's go again.

106
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,162
Cut!

107
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,289
Cut!

108
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,708
-Cut!
-It's not like you've worked with

109
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,084
those directors either, Mr. Lim.

110
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,460
Action!

111
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,088
-What?
-Cut. Again.

112
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,008
They say you can't fix people.

113
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,051
But…

114
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,262
I do.

115
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,639
Cut! Okay!

116
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,683
-We're done!
-Yes!

117
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,518
I aim to be a director who never forgets

118
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,645
the original spark that inspired me.

119
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,277
It must've been suffocating
sitting in this dark box for so long.

120
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,199
Wow, I can't believe
I held on to all of this.

121
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,084
Yes, let's kill Kang Pil-gu!

122
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,627
I get into a huge accident.

123
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,880
So I undergo a face swap
and come out completely transformed.

124
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,133
That way, another actor
can take over as Kang Pil-gu.

125
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,762
How about ending the scene
after she pushes me against the wall?

126
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,097
They're at work,
so they shouldn't take it too far.

127
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,726
Could you revise the part
about Kang Pil-gu becoming corrupt

128
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,729
just a tiny bit?

129
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,273
A writer's job is to
make sense of such things.

130
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,155
Did he really leave?

131
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,335
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

132
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,337
Director Bak, you can't do this!

133
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,297
Have you forgotten
everything we talked about?

134
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,132
-Be quiet.
-Come on, Director Bak.

135
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,926
-Just shut up.
-We'll be ruined!

136
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,011
It's me, Kang Pil-gu.

137
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,221
Listen to me.

138
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,806
This will ruin everything!

139
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,100
You can't do this!

140
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,395
Yes, I can.

141
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,941
What's the matter with Mr. Lim these days?

142
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,776
He doesn't know his lines
or rehearse his stunts.

143
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,569
I heard he even left
in the middle of a shoot

144
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:35,737
because he got tired of waiting.

145
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,031
Well, that day,

146
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,784
the director was on his laptop at the set

147
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,788
and wouldn't stop
making revisions to the script.

148
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,250
But of course, Mr. Lim was at fault too.

149
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,211
It's frustrating for me too, sir.

150
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,296
The actor leaves in the middle of a shoot,

151
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,090
and the director shuts down the set.

152
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,300
They have to stop one-upping each other!

153
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,760
They'll blow the schedule at this rate!

154
00:11:58,844 --> 00:11:59,970
Tell me about it, sir.

155
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,807
I tried everything I could,
from sitting them down to coaxing them.

156
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,060
Where has our Kang Pil-gu gone?

157
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,772
The bright, eager eyes he once had
are nowhere to be seen.

158
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,274
He's a totally different person now!

159
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,317
How is our drama
supposed to turn out properly?

160
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,277
Sir.

161
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,363
I'll sit them down this time
and very strongly

162
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,699
coax them.

163
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,577
-Let's get that original spark back, okay?
-Right, original spark!

164
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,556
I've gotten too jaded over the years.

165
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,308
If the lead actor
wanted revisions to the script,

166
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,143
I willingly made the revisions he wanted.

167
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,438
I bent over backward to please
the production company and leading actor,

168
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,107
all while tossing my own directing vision
straight into the trash.

169
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,317
BEST DIRECTOR AWARD
BAK BYEONG-GI

170
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,569
But I'm not going to do that anymore.

171
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,946
I'm going to get my original spark back!

172
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,741
The burning passion I had
while making my indie films.

173
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,494
The pure creative drive I had
that nobody could interfere with.

174
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,620
I'm bringing it all back

175
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,121
and pouring it into this project.

176
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,165
From this moment on, nothing and no one

177
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,000
can stand in the way of it.

178
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:26,640
I'm not…

179
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,727
-the only one scared stiff, right?
-I think he lost his damn mind.

180
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,312
Now what, Mr. Hwang?

181
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,814
It seems we just need Lim Hyeon-jun
to get his original spark back.

182
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,240
You're getting a call.

183
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,867
Right, sorry about that.

184
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,580
Hello, it's Hwang Ji-sun speaking.

185
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,582
This is Eunseong Group's
Corporate Planning Office.

186
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,585
Mr. Hwang,
the board has decided to dismiss you.

187
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,547
This dismissal is effective
immediately upon notification.

188
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,590
Excuse me? Hold on a second.

189
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,175
Did you say dismissal?

190
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,301
Are you telling me I'm fired?

191
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,803
Fired?

192
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,804
Why would you get fired?

193
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,806
I have no idea.

194
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,975
I asked why they fired me,

195
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,769
but all they said was that
the board had made their decision.

196
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,770
Maybe you misheard him.

197
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,522
Are you kidding me, bro?

198
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,986
Wait, remember when
Ms. Wi came to our office?

199
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,655
-Yeah.
-That day, she asked to see

200
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,865
our company's financial statements
out of the blue.

201
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,828
But if this continues,
King's Back will be at risk.

202
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,246
And she said the company would be at risk.

203
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,331
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

204
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,834
Ms. Wi is a very smart lady.
She wouldn't say that without good reason.

205
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,003
Look, I know.

206
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,380
So as soon as I got the call,
I ran to the office

207
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,965
-to check our financial statements.
-Okay.

208
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,258
But some guys told me

209
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,468
that there'd been a sudden pipe burst,
and it was under construction.

210
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,304
-They wouldn't let me in.
-Out of nowhere?

211
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,597
-Weird, right?
-Yeah.

212
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,058
Should we file a report with the police?

213
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,478
No, do we report this
to the Ministry of Employment and Labor?

214
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,314
Who? Me?

215
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,120
Owning a building like this
in Gangnam is impressive.

216
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,039
You're both truly impressive.

217
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,916
You know former Assemblyman
Ha Gee-wan, right?

218
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,877
During the Cheongwon City redevelopment,

219
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,714
you let him use your name
and received money in return.

220
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,633
That's absolutely ridiculous!

221
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,427
What are you getting at?

222
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,803
Don't you think

223
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,640
buying a 40-billion-won building in cash
without taking a single loan

224
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,933
is even more ridiculous?

225
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,393
We don't know who Ha Gee-wan is,

226
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,854
and we have nothing to say to you,
so please leave.

227
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,314
Your brother didn't take his own life.

228
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,775
You probably want to believe that he did,

229
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,902
but both of you know it's not true.

230
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,155
I'm not asking you
to come clean about everything today.

231
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,073
But know

232
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,035
that I'm going to clear
Mr. Woo Young-suk's name.

233
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,953
I won't give up
no matter how long it takes.

234
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,206
When you're ready to talk,

235
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,333
give me a call.

236
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,253
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN
SPORTS EUNSEONG

237
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,468
LIM HYEON-JUN

238
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:17,977
This is Wi Jeong-sin speaking.

239
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:19,813
Where are you?

240
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,274
I'm out. Why do you ask?

241
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:26,486
I'm sorry,
but could you come over right away?

242
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,613
To my place, I mean.

243
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,572
To your place?

244
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,616
What's this about?

245
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,701
You'll know when you get here.

246
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,828
Come now, okay?

247
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,745
But…

248
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:39,790
What's going on?

249
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,508
Why does he want me to come over?

250
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:53,638
Ms. Wi!

251
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,266
-You're here too, Mr. Hwang?
-Yes.

252
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,768
The thing is, Mr. Hwang

253
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,105
got fired from his own company.

254
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,733
We thought you might have some insight,

255
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,236
so I asked you to come
to discuss it together.

256
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,988
You got fired?

257
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,575
Yes! When you came to the office before,

258
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,369
you asked to see our financial statements
and said something felt off.

259
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,704
Why did you say that?

260
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,751
Ms. Wi, I desperately need
your help right now.

261
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,003
Well, can you think of
any reasons for your dismissal?

262
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,130
Reasons?

263
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,506
-Reason…
-What is it?

264
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,925
Right, that thing…

265
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,553
They suddenly said
they were conducting due diligence

266
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,388
and asked me to sign an MOU…

267
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,598
Or was it an MOW?

268
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,934
-You need to get it straight!
-It was an MOU!

269
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,813
They showed me an MOU
and asked me to sign it!

270
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,815
-Did you sign it?
-Of course not.

271
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,359
Something felt off,
so I asked them to explain it.

272
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,944
And the next thing I knew,

273
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,238
they held a board meeting
and got me fired!

274
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,698
-How is that right?
-All right!

275
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,117
I need you two to focus on me.

276
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,494
I have something to explain.

277
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,453
Okay.

278
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,914
This all started

279
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,459
with the long-term partnership
between Chairman Lee Dae-ho

280
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,668
and FSS Director Ha Gee-wan.

281
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,463
Lee Dae-ho provided
political funds to Ha Gee-wan,

282
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,882
who then used his power
to help Lee Dae-ho in return.

283
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,092
For example, information on
the Cheongwon City redevelopment.

284
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,386
Thanks to Ha Gee-wan's information,

285
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,640
Lee Dae-ho bought land for next to nothing
and made a huge profit.

286
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,392
And in order to launder that money,

287
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,521
he bought up entertainment agencies,
including King's Back.

288
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,688
Damn it!

289
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,399
-Hey, check out his huge catch!
-So that means

290
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,944
Lee Dae-ho is the bad guy here, right?

291
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,445
Are you saying that punk

292
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,824
used our company to launder illegal funds?

293
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,412
But right now, Chairman Lee
is having cash flow problems

294
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,541
because the construction costs for
his apartment projects have skyrocketed.

295
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,500
So that's why

296
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,128
he's trying to put out the fire
by reselling the agencies at a high price.

297
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,172
Mr. Hwang, the MOU you mentioned

298
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,883
was part of the process
for selling King's Back.

299
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,510
Damn it!

300
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:59,472
Are you saying he sold off our company
because he was short on money?

301
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,100
And he fired Mr. Hwang
because he was in the way?

302
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,476
That's right.

303
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,103
"In the way"?

304
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,689
Then what are we supposed to do?

305
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,816
Just sit back and take this?

306
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:10,775
No.

307
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,862
If we're going to strike back,
we need evidence first.

308
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:15,989
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes?

309
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,199
You and I will go to your office tomorrow

310
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,909
and gather the documents we need.

311
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:26,833
Thank you.

312
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,252
Ms. Wi, I feel like
I've got an army behind me,

313
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,962
-like nothing can stop me--
-Enough.

314
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:33,965
Thank you so much.

315
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,718
-Thank you.
-It's good you came.

316

IMPERIAL PRINT

317
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,989
Wow, I can't believe
this car has lasted this long.

318
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,827
You let my uncle take over the print shop.

319
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,914
-He's been driving it ever since.
-I see.

320
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,000
I thought I'd bring it along as part of
the "Find Your Original Spark" project.

321
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,085
Find my original spark?

322
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,339
Jeez, not you too.

323
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,383
Gosh, it's like my first time in here.

324
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,011
Was this car always so small?

325
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,472
Try not to get into any fights
on the set today.

326
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,016
It's not like I want to fight.

327
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,727
Director Bak still isn't ready
with the script.

328
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,063
I didn't want him to look bad
in front of the crew,

329
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,607
so I stepped in to buy him some time.

330
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,196
I wonder how Ms. Wi and Mr. Hwang's
agenda is going today.

331
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,740
Man, I should've gone with them.

332
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,951
Darn it.

333
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,288
Look, it's my office.
Why won't you let me in?

334
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,207
-You can't go in.
-Why not?

335
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,793
Mr. Hwang's personal belongings
are in there too.

336
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,629
He just wants to collect his things,
so what rights do you have to stop him?

337
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,799
We're following the chairman's orders
not to let anyone in the CEO's office.

338
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,842
If you have a problem,
talk to the chairman.

339
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,427
The chairman told you to do this?

340
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:05,515
Come on, don't be like this.

341
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,434
Why bother the chairman
over something so small?

342
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,228
How about this?

343
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,147
Do you see my laptop over there?

344
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:16,359
There's also a pair of luxury slippers
my wife got me for my birthday.

345
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,820
I'll just pop inside
and grab those two things, okay?

346
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,655
Damn it, we said no.

347
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:22,740
Did you just hit me?

348
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,701
Are you kidding me?

349
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,953
Get out of my way, you punks!

350
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:29,539
This is assault!

351
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,958
What do you think you're doing? Move!

352
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,376
-Move!
-Drag them out!

353
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,212
-Let go of me!
-You damn bastards!

354
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,298
Damn it, I'm not leaving!

355
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,258
Get off me!

356
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,021
IMPERIAL PRINT

357
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:53,980
Hello.

358
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:55,940
Hello.

359
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,442
Director Bak.

360
00:21:58,901 --> 00:21:59,902
-Hello.
-Hello.

361
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:00,862
Good morning.

362
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,072
-Go get ready.
-Okay.

363
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,704
Don't you have anything to say to me?

364
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,040
No, I don't.

365
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,045
Well, is the script finished?

366
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,464
I suppose…

367
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,382
Jeez.

368
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,634
What's that?

369
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,554
Why are you wearing your trophy
around your neck?

370
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,684
It's like that Imperial Print car.

371
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,561
-My original spark.
-What?

372
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,105
It represents my commitment
to always remember

373
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,983
the passion and purity of my past
and to find my original spark.

374
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,110
I'm keeping it close so I won't forget.

375
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,821
Director Bak.

376
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,281
Come on, don't be like that.

377
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,076
Oh, man.

378
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,870
That crazy punk. He's insane.

379
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,373
Why does he get so weird
whenever he directs something?

380
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:55,958
Seriously.

381
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:00,171
Pil-gu has done a complete 180
and is now a corrupt cop.

382
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,131
He takes money from drug addicts
and goes to hostess bars.

383
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,674
He's an absolute piece of shit.

384
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,343
-Jeez.
-But your acting

385
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,761
doesn't feel like a bad guy at all.

386
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,930
You're trying your best
to make him seem nice!

387
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,308
I really don't like any of this.

388
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,478
Kang Pil-gu is a hero.
How could he become a corrupt cop?

389
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,814
He's already in pain
from losing his friend.

390
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,399
How does he go from that
to being obsessed with money?

391
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,319
That's not who Kang Pil-gu is!

392
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,987
Are you saying
you can't follow the script?

393
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,198
It didn't seem right
when I read the project proposal,

394
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,867
but the script just makes it
even more ridiculous!

395
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:33,121
The whole thing feels forced,
Director Bak!

396
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,664
When will you come to your senses?

397
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,709
-What did you say?
-The writing is convincing enough,

398
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,003
and it's not the kind
to deserve your criticism!

399
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,339
-Do you seriously--
-What will it be?

400
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,092
If you don't want to cooperate,
we'll call off the shoot now.

401
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,804
Did you just threaten me?

402
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,431
Do you have a death wish?

403
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,433
You're the one who left during a shoot.

404
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,271
-But that was--
-In any case,

405
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,856
from now on,

406
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,649
we're going to follow the script to a T.

407
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,776
Hey, Director Bak.

408
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,571
Are you serious?

409
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,115
Hey, Bak Byeong-gi!

410
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,616
HWANG JI-SUN

411
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,326
Hey.

412
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,537
Were you able to get all the documents?

413
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,748
We couldn't even get into my office.
They kicked us out.

414
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,876
What? Why?

415
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:24,505
They stationed a bunch of hired thugs
in front of the building,

416
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,174
and they wouldn't let us in.

417
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,676
We tried to push our way in
and got into a scuffle.

418
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,219
Ms. Wi's clothes got ripped.

419
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,470
Her clothes got ripped?

420
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:32,847
-Jeez, come on.
-Stop it.

421
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,433
Why won't you let us in?

422
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:36,851
You!

423
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,687
Don't you dare move a step
until I get there!

424
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,439
-Okay. Hello?
-Do you realize this is illegal?

425
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,399
-Bro?
-We just want to pick up

426
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,527
-some personal belongings.
-Man, he's really mad.

427
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,821
Come on, it'll only take a moment.

428
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,576
Just let us in for a minute! Damn it!

429
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,996
Those damn thugs.

430
00:24:58,456 --> 00:24:59,415
Where are you going?

431
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,334
Start the car right now!

432
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,336
Mr. Lim, the shoot isn't over.

433
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,546
Are you leaving again? You can't do that!

434
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,132
Director!

435
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:10,426
Director, we're in big trouble!
Hold this for me.

436
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,636
We're in trouble.

437
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,930
Mr. Lim yelled, "Start the car right now!"
and took off.

438
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:14,847
Car? What car?

439
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,474
-The Imperial Print car.
-Damn it.

440
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,269
-There it goes!
-He's leaving again?

441
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,521
Have you lost your damn mind?

442
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,484
-Assistant Director, you're driving!
-Yes?

443
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,401
I'm driving!

444
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,071
-Let's go!
-I'll chase him down today!

445
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:31,739
Get in!

446
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,116
Go after him!

447
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,496
Get moving!

448
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,754
Come on, Gil-su. Step on it!

449
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,632
Those bastards won't get away with this.

450
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:53,094
Man, we should've told the director
we were leaving.

451
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,136
Jeez.

452
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,681
Why did you have to
bring this car along today?

453
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,516
Come on, step on it!

454
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,433
Damn it.

455
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,607
I let him walk all over me,
so he treats me like a doormat?

456
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,652
-Assistant Director.
-Yes, sir?

457
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,280
How many scenes do we need to shoot today?

458
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,239
Twelve scenes, sir.

459
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,532
Right.

460
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,910
We're shooting all 12 scenes today,
no matter what.

461
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:21,414
Even if I we have to stay up all night
until we cough up blood,

462
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,707
I'll get it all done.

463
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,377
We can't lose that car, all right?

464
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:27,920
Yes, sir.

465
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:29,964
-Drive.
-Okay.

466
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,132
Stay right behind him.

467
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,927
We're not leaving until you let us in,
so move already!

468
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,095
That's right!

469
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,681
Give me my luxury slippers back!

470
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,849
Give them back!

471
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,601
Give them… Yes, that's it! Give them back!

472
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,644
-Here.
-Hey!

473
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,105
-What are you doing?
-Now, go.

474
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:47,732
You jerk!

475
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,568
-My slipper!
-I told you to move aside!

476
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:51,777
Stop her.

477
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,195
Damn it!

478
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,573
-Damn it, get out of here!
-Move aside!

479
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:56,657
I've never worn these.

480
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,784
-Move!
-Let go of me!

481
00:26:58,868 --> 00:26:59,702
Damn it.

482
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,078
Hey, let go.

483
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,166
Ms. Wi! You little…

484
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,001
Hey, move!

485
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,502
IMPERIAL PRINT

486
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,681
You bastards!

487
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:52,963
No.

488
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,882
Kang Pil-gu!

489
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,386
Hey, take Ms. Wi and get out of here!

490
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,472
Ms. Wi, over there!

491
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,642
Damn it!

492
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,360
What's happening here?

493
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,864
Mr. Lim?

494
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,493
What the hell?

495
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,122
Are you kidding me?

496
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,792
We've got a situation in the parking lot.
Everyone, get down here.

497
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,378
Damn it, an actor's body is everything.

498
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:41,679
Stunt team!

499
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,141
Ready!

500
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,394
Action!

501
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,489
That's right, lay him out!

502
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,623
That's it!

503
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,542
-Director, zoom in on them!
-Nice!

504
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,377
-Pan to the right!
-Yes, just like that!

505
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,225
They say you can't fix people.

506
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,143
But…

507
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,145
I do.

508
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,249
Damn it.

509
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,046
-What is it?
-What do you want?

510
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,674
-What are you doing?
-Damn it!

511
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,510
Let go of me! What the hell?

512
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,261
Time to take out the trash.

513
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,305
-Let's go!
-That little…

514
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,127
Come on. Let's go.

515
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,045
Bro.

516
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:39,964
Where are my slippers?

517
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:49,640
ENTRY RESTRICTED

518
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,237
It seems we won't be able to
conduct due diligence today.

519
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,458
Are you okay?

520
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:17,501
Are you hurt?

521
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,054
Are you okay?

522
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,703
Are you sure you're okay?

523
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,246
Are you hurt?

524
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,497
I'm totally fine!

525
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,334
Are you sure you're okay?

526
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,878
How could those damn thugs
treat such a delicate woman that way?

527
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,258
Are you sure you're okay?

528
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,677
Say something!

529
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,975
-Mr. Hwang, are you okay?
-Yeah?

530
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,268
We don't have time for this.

531
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,605
Ms. Wi, we have to grab those documents.

532
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,023
-Right.
-Jeez.

533
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,735
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

534
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:27,988
The documents are over there.

535
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:29,490
Mr. Lim!

536
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,659
Mr. Lim!

537
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,119
Byeong-gi.

538
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:38,207
I thought you ran away from the set.
What just happened?

539
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,543
I didn't run away.
I just left without telling you.

540
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,628
-Byeong-gi.
-Yes?

541
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,674
If it weren't for you and the stunt team,
I wouldn't have made it.

542
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:49,134
Is there a problem with the company?

543
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,637
Things are going very wrong
with the company.

544
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,139
Those thugs just came out of nowhere and…

545
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,057
Jeez.

546
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,893
Look.

547
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,937
I don't know what's going on,

548
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,064
but it looks like
things have been sorted out.

549
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,440
Let's head back to the set now.

550
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:06,652
Justice lies in ruins,
yet you're worried about filming?

551
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,569
Change the schedule!

552
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,905
Why do you think I followed you
all the way here?

553
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,951
Unless there's a natural disaster,

554
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,744
there will be no schedule changes.

555
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:19,081
Mr. Lim, you're not going home today
until you shoot all 12 scenes.

556
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,958
-Mr. Lim's manager?
-Yes?

557
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,419
I'll be riding with Mr. Lim.
Please get the car ready.

558
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,878
-Producer?
-Yes.

559
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:25,879
-Assistant Director?
-Yes.

560
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:29,007
Will you two please safely and quickly
escort Mr. Lim?

561
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:32,052
Director Bak, I need to stay here…

562
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,221
-Mr. Lim, let's go!
-You have 12 scenes.

563
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,306
-Ms. Wi!
-We have to go now. Quickly!

564
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,808
Hurry!

565
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,351
Ms. Wi, should we take this too?

566
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,896
-Yes, we'll take everything.
-Everything? Okay.

567
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,984
Gosh, there's so much stuff. Here we go.

568
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:48,902
What?

569
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,199
Explain what happened.

570
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:57,745
The security firm wasn't aware
that the due diligence team was visiting.

571
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,371
Then Kang Pil-gu…

572
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,248
I mean, Lim Hyeon-jun suddenly appeared.

573
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,042
All those thugs
couldn't take down a single actor?

574
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:04,960
It wasn't like that, sir.

575
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,171
Mr. Lim gathered a crew somehow,

576
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:11,925
and they all acted a little crazy,
like a horde of starving zombies.

577
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,886
So?

578
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:19,224
They made a scene over one guy
in front of the due diligence team?

579
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,351
My apologies, sir.

580
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,478
But the bigger problem was
that one of his crew

581
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,397
recorded everything on his phone.

582
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:29,359
I worried the media would be all over it
if things got out of hand,

583
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,445
so I ordered them to pull back for now.

584
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,655
I'm very sorry, sir.

585
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,659
-They're back.
-What's going on?

586
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,995
-What happened?
-Were you guys in a fight?

587
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,746
-Oh, gosh.
-What happened?

588
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,625
-Are you okay?
-This looks really bad!

589
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,043
We'll start shooting immediately,
so get ready!

590
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,962
-Really?
-Right now?

591
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,716
Let's reschedule the shoot.
We won't get it done tonight anyway.

592
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,760
-I'll make it happen.
-What happened to you?

593
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,053
-Producer!
-Are you okay?

594
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,096
Cut. Okay!

595
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,599
-Mr. Lim.
-Good job!

596
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:02,392
-Nice work, everyone!
-Oh, man.

597
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,396
Jeez.

598
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,025
Mr. Lim, I'll bring the car around.

599
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:10,984
Okay.

600
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,779
-I'll remove my makeup, then.
-Okay.

601
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,989
-Oh, man.
-Good job, sir!

602
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,282
You too.

603
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,743
Oh, gosh.

604
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,123
Jeez. Here you go.

605
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,254
Man, Byeong-gi is one determined punk.

606
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,506
I can't believe we shot all 12 scenes.

607
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,135
It looks like Director Bak
found his original spark.

608
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:39,179
That damn original spark!

609
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:40,180
Stupid spark.

610
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,434
Anyway, what do we do now?

611
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,688
I got fired,
but you're still tied to King's Back.

612
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,314
Hey, what's to worry about?

613
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,985
Just keep handling my work
the way you always have.

614
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,279
I'll just hire you as a freelancer.

615
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:58,574
Will you pay me
out of your own pocket, then?

616
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,745
I'll make sure you get a bonus
on top of your salary.

617
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,330
-How's that?
-Seriously?

618
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,707
You're the best, bro!

619
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,799
So does this mean
we can't ever go back to that office?

620
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:20,596
We signed that office by running around
until our feet were covered in blisters.

621
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,097
We painted the walls together,

622
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,599
and we even got the chairs together.

623
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,978
I've had a hand in everything there,
right down to the coffee mugs.

624
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,815
I can't believe I'm not allowed inside.
This is so unfair!

625
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,986
Hey, I'm still with King's Back.
Of course, you can go inside.

626
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,238
Does that mean

627
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,533
I'm no longer CEO Hwang?

628
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,243
Am I Manager Hwang now?

629
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,913
Am I supposed to call Gil-su
"team leader"?

630
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,998
Oh, damn it.

631
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,751
I haven't even told my wife yet.

632
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:51,668
Hey!

633
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:53,795
Stay confident!

634
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:55,505
Jeez.

635
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,966
Just use this place as your office.

636
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,801
This is your seat. Got it, CEO Hwang?

637
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,388
Anyway, those bastards…

638
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,017
First, they fire you over the phone,

639
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,561
then they send thugs to the company.

640
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,482
How do we get back at those bastards?

641
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,234
Bro, didn't you stay up all night?
Are you going somewhere?

642
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,071
Huh?

643
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:21,949
I've got plans.

644
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,786
What plans could you have
at a crucial time like this?

645
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,997
Oh, you're going to see
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin again.

646
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,165
I mean…

647
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,877
Hey, I'm doing this for both of us.

648
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,755
We need to figure out our next move.

649
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:37,839
Right?

650
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,342
-Do you plan on staying a manager forever?
-No.

651
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,429
I'll meet with Ms. Wi to work out a plan,

652
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:49,101
so you just sit tight and figure out
how to manage my work from now on, okay?

653
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,310
And don't cry!

654
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,854
See you later.

655
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,231
Okay, bro. See you!

656
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:58,026
Gosh, who knew
he was such a romantic at heart?

657
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,033
Why did you come in a car like this?

658
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,369
-What's wrong with it?
-It stands out!

659
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,371
Come on, just get in.

660
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,164
-No, you get in first.
-Huh?

661
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,583
-Why? What is it? What's wrong?
-Get in.

662
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,543
Jeez.

663
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,896
Kang Pil-gu would never
drive a car like this.

664
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,815
Oh, come on. It's fine.

665
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,610
I'm not Kang Pil-gu.
I'm superstar Lim Hyeon-jun, so it's okay.

666
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,613
How's Mr. Hwang holding up?

667
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,410
He's in shock, of course,
and having a mental breakdown.

668
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,289
Chairman Lee Dae-ho is a ruthless man.

669
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,915
I'm sure he planned it all from the start.

670
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,877
Gosh, why'd we have to get involved
with someone like him?

671
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,380
I had a bad feeling
ever since I went fishing with him.

672
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,551
But why are you digging into someone
that dangerous?

673
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:05,719
Aren't you scared?

674
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:07,929
No one else can do it

675
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,015
except me.

676
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,226
I've been holding onto this case
for a long time,

677
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,562
and I want to get to the bottom of it.

678
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,565
Thanks to Mr. Hwang,
I've gathered nearly all the evidence.

679
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,111
I'm just trying to figure out
the most effective way to expose it.

680
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,369
Well…

681
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,998
I'm not the type
to take crap from anyone, either.

682
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,210
Let's think about it.

683
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,140
Why are we the only ones here?

684
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,266
Gosh.

685
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,521
You only watch shows like Kang Pil-gu,
so you have no idea what's going on.

686
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,314
Excuse me?

687
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,194
If you watch melodramas or rom-coms,
you'd catch on right away.

688
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:06,738
What do you mean?

689
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:10,659
Haven't you ever seen dramas
where a wealthy heir or rich boyfriend

690
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,244
rents out a whole place for a date?

691
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:13,870
The whole place?

692
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,288
You rented out the whole place?

693
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,459
Don't you have better things
to spend your money on than this?

694
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,670
Jeez, I knew you'd say that.

695
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:22,879
I didn't spend any money.

696
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,841
I just said I'd use it
since there's no shoot today.

697
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:27,926
And I wanted

698
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:30,178
to be alone with you.

699
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,724
You're always so conscious of others
when you're with me.

700
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,273
I come here every now and then.

701
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,899
This is where I made my debut.

702
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,736
It was just a minor role, but still.

703
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,573
-The title was…
-The City of Romance?

704
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:53,869
How did you know?

705
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,246
It was one of the questions
when I joined your fan page.

706
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,791
It was a real headache
trying to join that fan page.

707
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,049
I think I've seen this place on TV.

708
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,427
This takes me back.

709
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:56,681
I think we filmed somewhere around here.

710
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,771
By the way, how did you become an actor?

711
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,234
I heard there was a part-time job
as an extra, so I came.

712
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,362
For some reason,
I really liked being on set.

713
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,405
And I thought I'd do well.

714
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,659
So you were discovered
while working as an extra?

715
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:16,868
Yes, pretty much.

716
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,956
You have to admit,
my looks are hard to ignore.

717
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,417
I'm good-looking now,
so imagine how handsome I was back then.

718
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,338
As soon as the director saw me,
he gave me a line to say.

719
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,799
But I'd never acted before,

720
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,217
so how could I deliver that line?

721
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,135
I was so nervous,

722
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:37,180
I still remember the line to this day.

723
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,269
Wait!

724
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,984
The last train just left.

725
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:56,199
"The last train just left."

726
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:57,534
Cut!

727
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,202
I nailed it on the first take.

728
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,206
It was exhilarating.

729
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,418
After that,
I got right into studying acting.

730
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,920
Then I gained experience in the theater.

731
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:10,880
And then I eventually got into movies.

732
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:12,299
What about Kang Pil-gu?

733
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,301
How did you join Kang Pil-gu?

734
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,682
It all started when a film student
came to my shop

735
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,892
to print the script
for his graduation project.

736
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,186
Hello.

737
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:29,190
I had a script printed here a while ago,

738
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:32,736
and there's a bit of an issue.

739
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,364
He begged me to be in his film, so I did.

740
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,826
And it ended up receiving
a major award out of nowhere.

741
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:44,956
Ever since, I've practically been
a slave to Kang Pil-gu.

742
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,168
That college student
was Director Bak Byeong-gi.

743
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,295
Really?

744
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:56,426
So the director was your good luck charm.

745
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,679
A good luck charm?

746
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,390
You made a comeback as an actor
thanks to him.

747
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,225
And you even got to meet Kang Pil-gu.

748
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:11,775
Kang Pil-gu isn't just a drama character.

749
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:13,443
He stands up for the weak,

750
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,987
takes risks, and gives the bad guys
what they deserve.

751
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:20,533
He helped me forget
my own troubles for a bit.

752
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:24,579
A lot of people admire
Kang Pil-gu's sense of justice.

753
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:29,167
You know police applications shot up
because of him, right?

754
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,044
Kang Pil-gu is

755
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,756
really, really special.

756
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:38,593
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

757
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,345
How lucky is that?

758
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,393
Yet you call yourself
a slave to Kang Pil-gu…

759
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,772
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun,
you've lost your original spark.

760
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,984
Come on.

761
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,112
I'm being serious.

762
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,865
I desperately want to play
a different character now.

763
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,247
Although, I'll have to work hard
as Kang Pil-gu for now.

764
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,963
Hyeon-jun said there's someone he likes.
Who is she?

765
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,297
Did he tell you that?

766
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,800
She doesn't exist, does she?
He must've lied to me.

767
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,177
If you're so curious, ask him yourself.

768
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:23,096
Don't put me on the spot like that.

769
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,432
Then can you start
a dating rumor about him and me?

770
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,684
Jeez, that's a disaster waiting to happen!

771
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,562
What's the matter with you these days?

772
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,856
I really want things
to work out with Hyeon-jun.

773
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:36,943
Still, that's just too much.
I can't make up a rumor like that.

774
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,405
Then can I start one?

775
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,073
Come on, Se-na.

776
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,577
Stop wasting your time,
and focus on this project.

777
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,163
Anyway, why'd you ask to meet
at the production company

778
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,873
instead of King's Back?

779
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,083
I got fired.

780
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,043
That's why
I'm using this place temporarily.

781
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:55,545
What happened?

782
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,464
Did you do something wrong?

783
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,757
What could I have possibly done wrong?

784
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,218
I think they wanted to
sell off the company,

785
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:03,678
but I was in the way, so they fired me.

786
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:06,264
Oh, right. Is your agency okay?

787
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:10,435
Wouldn't they try to sell off
my company and yours at the same time?

788
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,856
-Does Hyeon-jun know about this?
-Of course, he does.

789
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,027
Just stay still for now.

790
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:20,862
And keep a low profile.

791
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,363
I always stay still.

792
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,704
I've been coming here for a long time.

793
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,165
I don't bring just anyone here.

794
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:36,669
So do we have nine more dates left?

795
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,046
No, that's not right.

796
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,216
We met today
because of Mr. Hwang's situation,

797
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,425
so this doesn't count.

798
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,010
That didn't even take five minutes.

799
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:48,139
Five minutes is plenty.

800
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,808
It's not something we can solve overnight.

801
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,397
Let's eat quickly and get going.
The first episode airs tonight.

802
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,233
What's the rush?

803
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,817
I watched the rough cut.

804
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,194
But I haven't watched it.

805
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,947
I have to get home quickly
to watch it on time.

806
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:04,948
Hurry up and eat.

807
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,247
I'll treasure this moment

808
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,166
for the rest of my life.

809
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:18,920
No matter what role I take on
in the future,

810
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,674
I promise to give my all
and remain a humble actor.

811
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:23,758
Kang Pil-gu is

812
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,970
really, really special.

813
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:30,098
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

814
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,350
How lucky is that?

815
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,021
Thank you so much!

816
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,983
-Hyeon-jun.
-Jeez, you scared me.

817
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,110
I'll be staying at my friend's tonight.

818
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,528
-Which friend?
-Hong-sin.

819
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,238
We're watching the first episode together.

820
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:46,906
Hong-sin?

821
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:51,077
Hey, where's the fun
if it's just the two of you?

822
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,745
You need the main character.

823
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,122
What? You're coming too?

824
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,498
Give me five minutes to get ready.

825
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,792
Your motives seem pretty dishonest.

826
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,839
There's nothing dishonest about them.

827
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,008
You said you liked Ms. Wi too.

828
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,844
You'd better help me out
unless you want me dating Su-ji.

829
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,265
Jeez.

830
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,778
Here, I'll take that.

831
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:31,951
Shall we go in?

832
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,538
-Can we…
-Oh, yes.

833
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,551
You live in such a nice place.

834
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,012
Why does your power go out so often?

835
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:53,556
Why does it happen?

836
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,058
And you could've gone to a hotel.

837
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,435
Why insist on coming to our tiny place?

838
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,938
Well, to kill two birds with one stone.

839
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:03,566
I thought we could rehearse together.

840
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:06,986
And since we've got
three characters from Kang Pil-gu here,

841
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,614
I figured we could watch
the first episode together and chat.

842
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,199
Wouldn't that be nice?

843
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,575
Yes, it'd be totally nice.

844
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,038
I'm sorry, but I really don't get it.

845
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,790
-Of all places…
-Cut it out.

846
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,124
What's wrong with you?

847
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,252
Ms. Wi, I guess you're slow
to pick up on things.

848
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,880
Hyeon-jun insisted on coming,

849
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,216
-probably to see you.
-Hey.

850
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:30,593
I guess you've been working out a lot.

851
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:31,844
-But it's true.
-You're looking good.

852
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,182
-Stop laughing.
-What?

853
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,523
Mr. Lim, have you eaten yet?
I can make you ramyeon.

854
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:44,732
Ramyeon sounds great!

855
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,943
-I like it.
-Come and help me out.

856
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:47,860
But there's so much food.

857
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,074
Darn, we're out of ramyeon.

858
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:54,867
We don't have any.

859
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:56,703
-Don't open that.
-You don't have any?

860
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,371
We'll go out and buy some ramyeon.

861
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,164
-Right now?
-Yes.

862
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:02,417
-Hey!
-Get moving. Hurry up.

863
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,960
-Hold on.
-Just go!

864
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,921
-But we have so much food…
-Be quiet!

865
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:07,964
All right, let's go.

866
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:18,725
Man, I'm so nervous.

867
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,228
Mr. Lim!

868
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,612
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

869
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:49,172
What's the point of asking
when you're about to die?

870
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,048
Mr. Lim, here comes your catchphrase.

871
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,635
-They say you can't fix people.
-They say you can't fix people.

872
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:55,720
But…

873
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,723
-But I do.
-But I do.

874
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:04,771
Kang Pil-gu is

875
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:07,982
really, really special.

876
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:11,986
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

877
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,238
How lucky is that?

878
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:18,826
FIRST EPISODE VIEWERSHIP RATINGS: 4.3%

879
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,498
What were the viewership ratings
for the first episode of season four?

880
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,377
It was 12.4%.

881
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:32,840
That's 8.1% higher
than this season's first episode.

882
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,175
What about season three?

883
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,510
It was 11.7%.

884
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,762
Season 2 was 13.5%,

885
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,680
and season 1 was 8.9%.

886
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:43,059
So that makes 4.3% an all-time low.

887
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,686
Was there an important match
or something that night?

888
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,646
Not at all.

889
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,397
The weather was nice, though.

890
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,859
Did everyone go out
to enjoy the weather, then?

891
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:54,987
If this were any other drama,

892
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:57,281
those ratings wouldn't be too bad
for a first episode.

893
00:51:57,365 --> 00:52:00,910
The problem is, they're too low
compared to our previous seasons.

894
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,329
That's right!
Remember what I said from the start?

895
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,623
I said this season's storyline is weird.

896
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,961
The viewers know exactly
what they want to see in Kang Pil-gu.

897
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,880
Sure, for the sake of
changing the storyline,

898
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,424
he can become a corrupt cop.

899
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:19,595
But he needs to return
to the original Kang Pil-gu quickly.

900
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,598
Do you really think that's why?

901
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,643
Hey, they say an old eagle
is better than a crow.

902
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:27,687
Kang Pil-gu still has what it takes.

903
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,523
The ratings will shoot up, so don't worry.

904
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,070
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5
BOUNCES BACK, MAKES LITTLE SPLASH

905
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:40,825
THE BIGGER CONCERN
IS THE VIEWERS' REACTION

906
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:47,498
Episode 1 was 4.3%.

907
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:48,833
Episode 2 was 5.1%,

908
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,376
episode 3 was 5.2%,

909
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,336
and Episode 4 was 4.9%.

910
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:57,508
That's enough, sir.

911
00:52:57,592 --> 00:53:00,011
We're taking hits everywhere.

912
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,013
It's my fault for not being good enough.

913
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,141
No single person is to blame
for these results.

914
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,726
Even with a record-setting
production budget,

915
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,352
the global star, Gwon Se-na,

916
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:11,522
and a previous season
with ratings above 20%,

917
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:13,190
if it's meant to fail, it'll fail.

918
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,862
Still, thanks to the overseas pre-sales,

919
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,322
I don't think we lost anything.

920
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,157
That's true.

921
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,409
But it hurts to see Kang Pil-gu,

922
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:26,495
a season drama that will go down
in our country's TV history,

923
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,748
end in such a miserable and tragic way.

924
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,499
It's just heartbreaking.

925
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:34,629
I asked to promote it on UTube,

926
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,923
but someone refused to listen.

927
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:39,884
-Oh, Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.
-Yes?

928
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,552
-Congratulations.
-Excuse me?

929
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,764
You hated playing Kang Pil-gu so much.

930
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,099
Now you can't play him anymore,
even if you wanted to.

931
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,225
You must be pleased.

932
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,269
Well…

933
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:54,440
The script is nearly complete,
and barely any scenes left to shoot.

934
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:57,944
The only thing left for me to do
is focus on post-production.

935
00:53:58,653 --> 00:53:59,570
-Right.
-Yes.

936
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:00,529
Of course.

937
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,866
We may have missed out
on a grand farewell,

938
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:07,703
but we must still give our best effort
until the very end.

939
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,374
What effort?

940
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:19,715
Oh!

941
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:25,179
We should do something to spark
the viewers' interest in Kang Pil-gu.

942
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,640
How about holding a press conference?

943
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,356
A press conference?

944
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,900
Is it too late for that?

945
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:42,738
I'll now pass the mic
over to the reporters.

946
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:44,907
We'll take some time
to discuss any questions

947
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,702
they may have about
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu 5.

948
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,537
I have a question for Director Bak.

949
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,998
The ratings have been low
up to the fourth episode.

950
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:54,458
What should we look out for
in the upcoming episodes?

951
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:57,378
You'll see why Kang Pil-gu had no choice

952
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:58,629
but to become corrupt.

953
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,590
I think the viewers will
understand Kang Pil-gu better

954
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:04,051
and really immerse themselves
into the drama.

955
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,262
We won't give up,

956
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,806
so please keep watching until the end.

957
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:09,932
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun,

958
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:14,020
some reviews claim you haven't fully
understood your character this season.

959
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:15,062
Do you agree?

960
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,898
Yes, I admit it.

961
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:22,486
This take on Kang Pil-gu
differs so much from his righteous image

962
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,031
that I definitely felt pressure
playing him.

963
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:28,993
I'm continuously communicating
with the director

964
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:33,289
and working harder to portray
this new side of Kang Pil-gu

965
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:35,124
in a way the viewers can accept.

966
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,210
Go ahead.

967
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:40,337
I find it meaningful
that Kang Pil-gu's character

968
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,506
didn't follow
the previous success pattern,

969
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:48,012
but instead chose to take on
a new challenge despite the risks.

970
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,138
-Did we give her the question?
-No.

971
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,474
-There's anticipation for what is to come.
-She's a reporter.

972
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:55,394
Could you say a few words
to die-hard fans like me?

973
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:00,691
Well, first of all,
I'd like to thank all the viewers

974
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,902
who have shown
continuous love for Kang Pil-gu.

975
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:07,198
To be honest, it wasn't an easy decision

976
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:10,076
to join this season.

977
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:13,329
I really wanted to break away
from the image of Kang Pil-gu

978
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,039
that is so closely associated with me.

979
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:19,376
I guess that desire
showed in my performance.

980
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,340
But while filming this season,

981
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:27,760
I came to realize once again
how special and precious

982
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:30,471
the role of Kang Pil-gu is to me.

983
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,100
Kang Pil-gu is

984
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:37,478
really, really special.

985
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,773
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

986
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,067
How lucky is that?

987
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,863
So I returned to filming
with a renewed sense of affection.

988
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:53,077
With twists and hints falling into place,
the story will get even more exciting.

989
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,871
I truly appreciate your trust in me
and sincerely hope

990
00:56:56,956 --> 00:56:58,457
you'll stay with us until the end.

991
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,459
This question is for Ms. Gwon Se-na.

992
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:03,295
What was it like
acting with Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun?

993
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,756
Even though it had been a while
since Sad Waltz,

994
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,385
we worked together very well on set,
as if no time had passed.

995
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,680
But when we were filming
close-contact scenes,

996
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,849
he got incredibly shy.

997
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:20,437
No, I didn't get shy.

998
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,356
Who said I got shy?

999
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,733
It wasn't that I felt shy.

1000
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:27,987
Kang Pil-gu only had crushies…

1001
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,323
I mean, he only had crushes.

1002
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,033
So since it was his first romantic scene,

1003
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,827
I guess he got slightly nervous.

1004
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,831
Who knew a seasoned actor
could get nervous?

1005
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,666
Next question, please.

1006
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:46,589
Mr. Lim, I heard you
recently got back together

1007
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:50,134
with an actress you dated in the past
after being apart for a long time.

1008
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,803
Could she be here with us today?

1009
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:54,805
Is it Gwon Se-na? They used to date.

1010
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:55,890
What's this about?

1011
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:58,809
-Is it true?
-I'm sorry,

1012
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:01,020
but please refrain
from asking personal questions.

1013
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,021
No, that's fine.

1014
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:04,565
I'll answer the question.

1015
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,320
You asked if the person I like
is here today.

1016
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,367
Yes, she is.

1017
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,924
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

1018
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,637
There isn't much time left.

1019
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,013
You have to release it soon.

1020
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:22,101
The documents you provided
will serve as the most crucial evidence.

1021
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,436
Why won't they let me in?

1022
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,771
What are they up to?

1023
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:29,400
But in reality,
things don't end as beautifully

1024
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,986
as they do in your dramas.

1025
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,529
I think Ms. Wi is in danger.

1026
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,740
What I said about the fine line
between cursed and fated.

1027
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,076
It turns out

1028
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:40,995
I was right.

1029
