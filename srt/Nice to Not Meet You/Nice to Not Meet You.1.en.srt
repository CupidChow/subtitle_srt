EPISODE 1

00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,430
IMPERIAL PRINT

3
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,611
Last one to leave today too?

4
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,362
I just need to finish up two orders!

5
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,991
Did you take care of that reprint order?

6
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,453
-Yeah, they switched to rough-gloss paper.
-Good job!

7
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,291
-You're here!
-Hey there!

8
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,542
-Come on in!
-Come on, let's eat.

9
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,045
-You're back!
-Come and eat.

10
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,172
-Fried chicken!
-Hey, come over here!

11
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,385
-I gave you my heart, my love, my all
-My love, my all

12
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,931
-But now you're leaving, like a stranger
-But now you're leaving, like a stranger

13
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,476
-Take the pain of goodbye with you
-Take the pain of goodbye with you

14
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,314
-You heartless one
-You heartless one

15
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,358
-Yes, fried chicken!
-Listen.

16
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:51,111
What do you call a chicken
that's proud of itself?

17
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,822
Come on, guess.

18
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,615
It's pride chicken!

19
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,618
Right. Let's dig in.

20
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,995
-Thanks for the food.
-Very funny.

21
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,498
-Come on, pride chicken!
-Yeah, I heard you.

22
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,460
Man, I thought it was hilarious.

23
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,003
-Let's eat.
-Jeez.

24
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,214
Hey, hold on.

25
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,175
This looks delicious.

26
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,053
Damn, it's gone cold.

27
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,142
When did you take that?

28
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,519
Let me explain, bro…

29
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,441
IMPERIAL PRINT

30
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,360
I got so much done today. Time to wrap up.

31
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,572
This right here.

32
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,283
Could you deliver this yourself?

33
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,662
You don't want to go, do you?

34
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,789
Would you want to go if you were me?

35
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,375
Well, it's Chae-bin's birthday today, so…

36
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:52,089
Never mind, bro.
It's close, so I'll stop by on the way.

37
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,507
It's Chae-bin's birthday?

38
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,303
-Forget it. Just go home.
-No, it's okay.

39
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,597
It'd be awkward if you ran into Se-na.

40
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,307
Look.

41
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,101
If I went like this,

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,353
maybe she wouldn't recognize me.

43
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,981
Do you really think
she wouldn't notice her ex in that?

44
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,611
I wonder if she knows you live like this.

45
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,488
Will you really go yourself?

46
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,616
Hurry up and leave
before I change my mind.

47
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,034
Thanks, bro. See you!

48
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,076
Hey!

49
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,175
THE QUEEN OF MELODRAMA

50
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,807
15 YEARS AGO

51
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,019
Please leave now.

52
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,687
I'd like to get off work.

53
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,023
Mr. Hong.

54
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,983
This is all a misunderstanding.

55
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,696
It's true we saw each other
while filming Sad Waltz,

56
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,740
but we broke up a long time ago!

57
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,995
If word gets out about this,
I'll have to step down

58
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,831
from all my commercials,
melodramas, and mini-series!

59
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,750
And I'd have to pay contract penalties!

60
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,168
-Please…
-Listen.

61
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,004
That's your problem, isn't it?

62
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,507
And there's plenty of evidence
in front of you.

63
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,092
Don't be ridiculous.

64
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,343
But this…

65
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:25,224
Hyeon-jun was still hung up on me
and begged to see me one last time.

66
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,560
He said if I refused,
he'd come looking for me on set.

67
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,605
I had no choice but to see him.

68
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,568
That's what happened, right?

69
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,822
Say something. Please?

70
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,033
Please.

71
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,454
Don't do that.
You're making me uncomfortable.

72
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,664
Please get up.

73
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,791
Everything she said is true.

74
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,584
I…

75
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,671
I forced her into seeing me.

76
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,589
Mr. Hong.

77
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,260
Please don't publish that article.

78
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,553
See?

79
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,431
I told you there's nothing between us.

80
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,725
It's not fair for me.

81
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,767
Please, Mr. Hong.

82
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,292
Why would hotshots like them
meet in a place like this?

83
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:03,989
Excuse me.

84
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,074
Excuse me.

85
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,128
Oh.

86
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,339
You're here, Ms. Wi.

87
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,219
Why are you alone, sir?

88
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,720
Where's the assemblyman?

89
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:30,307
You're not on the level
to have a private meeting with him.

90
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:34,770
Take a seat.

91
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:53,497
I'll be in the US for eight months
filming the second season of Save Zone,

92
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,666
so I'm not sure
if the timing will work out.

93
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,085
Eight months will fly by
while we get ready for filming.

94
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,379
If you agree to this role, Ms. Gwon,

95
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,756
I'd be willing to wait eight years,
let alone eight months.

96
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,426
Yes?

97
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,637
I'm here to drop off the script.

98
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,556
Oh, that was quick, Mr. Lim.

99
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,349
Why is this so wet?

100
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,017
It's raining, so…

101
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:14,977
All right.

102
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:17,980
What's this?

103
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,440
It's the script we had custom-printed.

104
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,693
I'll get going, then.

105
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,610
Wait.

106
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,155
Thank you.

107
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,285
I like it.

108
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,078
You do?

109
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,247
It's a custom-printed special edition!

110
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,334
Sir!

111
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,300
Did Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan

112
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,386
hire an aide
just to take the fall for him?

113
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,889
Does Assemblyman Ha
really have nothing to do

114
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,974
with the redevelopment in Cheongwon City?

115
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,102
Are you saying his aide
took all that money for himself?

116
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,189
I know, right? The nerve of that guy.

117
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,690
Mr. Woo Young-suk

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,860
was supposed to meet me tomorrow.

119
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,613
How could someone like that just die?

120
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,031
We have breaking news.

121
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,366
This morning,
at a private parking lot in Seoul,

122
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,535
Mr. Woo, an aide
to Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan,

123
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,954
who was involved
in the redevelopment of Cheongwon City,

124
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,372
was found dead.

125
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,000
Charcoal briquettes and a note,
believed to be a suicide letter,

126
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,502
were discovered at the scene.

127
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,296
Ms. Wi, it seems you're upset

128
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,840
because you missed out on an exclusive.

129
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,302
But these are the facts, all right?

130
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,931
I'm upset
because I missed out on an exclusive?

131
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,518
Mr. Woo's family
wants to avoid escalating the issue.

132
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,771
So if you keep poking around,

133
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,232
a lot of people will get hurt, understand?

134
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,067
Open it.

135
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,490
A reporter needs to move fast.

136
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,787
That should be enough to get a decent SUV.

137
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,039
Take it.

138
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,433
What are you doing?

139
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,032
I learned a good lesson, thanks to you.

140
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,993
Think of the money as my lesson fee.

141
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,963
Am I really this pathetic?

142
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,300
What was so embarrassing
that I even put on a cap?

143
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,354
I thought it might be you,
and I was right.

144
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,565
It's been a while.

145
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,234
You haven't changed as much as I expected.

146
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,698
You haven't changed either.

147
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,077
Why did you come here?

148
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,247
You knew I'd be here,

149
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,291
so you shouldn't have come.

150
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,795
Did you show up looking like that,
hoping I'd feel guilty or something?

151
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,339
-What?
-Or has life

152
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,299
actually gotten that hard for you?

153
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,145
I'll pretend I didn't hear any of that.

154
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,067
Take care.

155
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,883
You knew I'd be here,

156
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,427
so you shouldn't have come.

157
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:29,564
15 YEARS AGO

158
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:47,958
Cut!

159
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,428
Give it to me.

160
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,142
I'll do it.

161
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:14,901
Who are you?

162
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,529
What the hell?

163
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,864
-What's going on?
-You scared me.

164
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,365
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

165
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,494
Man, you scared me.
How did you even get in?

166
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,496
-My head is killing me.
-Goodness.

167
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,416
-I think I'm being kidnapped.
-Kidnapped?

168
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,668
-My location is…
-I'm not kidnapping you!

169
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,005
-Don't open the door!
-I think we're crossing a bridge.

170
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,424
What bridge are we on right now?

171
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,551
It's the Yeongdong Bridge!

172
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,969
I'm on the Yeongdong Bridge!

173
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:45,265
-Please come to the Yeongdong Bridge!
-Is she insane?

174
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,684
Where are you taking me in this junky car?

175
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,352
A RELIABLE POLICE FORCE, A SAFE NATION

176
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,897
Since there's been
a misunderstanding between you two,

177
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,315
and you came in voluntarily,

178
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,026
we'll review the dashcam footage
to confirm what happened.

179
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:58,945
Please take a look.

180
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,751
Unbelievable.

181
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,712
That's the footage from the front.

182
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,048
Here's the next one.

183
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,259
Come on, seriously?

184
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,971
See? Look at that.

185
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:28,183
We saw that she got in my car by herself,
so I'm innocent.

186
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,100
Let's keep watching.

187
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,854
Maybe he pretended not to notice
there was someone in the back.

188
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,316
Wow, are you serious?

189
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,195
Go ahead and play it.

190
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,196
All right.

191
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,324
That bitch.

192
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,828
"You shouldn't have come"?

193
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,582
-Hold on, I wasn't calling you a bitch.
-Seriously, who does she think she is?

194
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,084
-Look.
-I can't believe she said that.

195
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,545
As if she hasn't changed one bit.

196
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:00,048
Her face is all sagging now,
with wrinkles around her eyes.

197
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,345
And how is her acting
still as bad as before?

198
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,306
She hasn't improved one bit.

199
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,849
No progress at all.

200
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:15,564
It's always the same long straight hair
and the same lousy acting.

201
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,608
Man, I'm sick of it!

202
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,777
I'm so sick of it!

203
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,446
Who are you?

204
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,495
-The thing is…
-It seems

205
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,540
you were very angry at the time.

206
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,626
Well, that settles things
between you two, right?

207
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,380
I…

208
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,593
I'm really sorry.

209
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,053
Fine, then.

210
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,724
Accusing an innocent person of kidnapping…

211
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,809
Unbelievable.

212
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,728
I know, right?

213
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,772
I got an innocent man killed

214
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,275
and turned another into a kidnapper.

215
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,322
What's the matter with me?

216
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,408
Well…

217
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,744
I'm such an idiot!

218
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,876
Officer, please just arrest me.
I deserve to get arrested.

219
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,337
Who knows what other stupid mess
I'll get myself into?

220
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,671
Just arrest me instead.

221
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,257
Please throw me in jail!

222
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,385
I'm begging you to throw me in jail.

223
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,430
She sure is a mess when she's drunk.

224
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,974
-I'm free to go now, right?
-Yes.

225
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,646
-Take care, Officer.
-Goodbye.

226
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:43,026
Just hurry up and put me in jail already.

227
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,929
Drink that and sober up before you go.

228
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,515
And don't hop into
someone else's car again.

229
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,894
It's a scary world out there, you know.

230
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,939
You're lucky you got in my car.

231
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,734
Thank you.

232
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,199
You're obviously an average office worker.

233
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,327
I don't know what made you drink so much,

234
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,957
but it's oftentimes not your fault
when something bad happens.

235
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,626
So stop blaming yourself

236
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,128
and keep moving on.

237
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,921
You need to be successful…

238
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,091
Has life actually gotten
that hard for you?

239
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,886
Or else, people will look down on you.

240
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,307
Hold on a minute.

241
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,565
THANK YOU
EUNSEONGILBO

242
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,361
If you ever need my help,

243
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,321
will you give me a call?

244
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,584
Fine, then.

245
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,627
Don't look at me like that.

246
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,713
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

247
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,300
I'll be off, then.

248
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:41,079
Mr. Woo Young-suk was
supposed to meet me tomorrow.

249
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,915
How could someone like that just die?

250
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,359
GWON SE-NA NAMED MUSE FOR LUXURY BRAND

251
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,488
GWON SE-NA'S SAVE ZONE IS A GLOBAL HIT

252
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,386
Hello.

253
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,388
Yes?

254
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,600
I had a script printed here a while ago,

255
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,061
and there's a bit of an issue.

256
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:49,981
An issue?

257
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,691
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

258
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,903
Oh, this one.

259
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,406
I believe Mr. Hwang took care of this.

260
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,285
He said it was an independent film
for a graduation project

261
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,204
and did it at cost price
without leaving any profit.

262
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,625
Yes, he was very considerate
and offered me a discount on the printing

263
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,585
and got it done
despite the tight deadline.

264
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:11,961
He also accommodated

265
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,880
over ten revision requests
for the cover design.

266
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,131
I'm very grateful.

267
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,424
Right.

268
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,426
Mr. Hwang really went
out of his way to help you.

269
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,427
He really did.

270
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,512
But gratitude is one thing,
and this is business.

271
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:25,141
I can't overlook mistakes
just because I appreciate his help.

272
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,479
I'm sure you can overlook them
if you're truly grateful.

273
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,689
But this is my first feature film,

274
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,233
so I'm afraid I can't just let this slide.

275
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,868
Go ahead and show me
where the mistakes are.

276
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,748
The best boy electric's name
is Na Yun-seon,

277
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,125
but it was printed as "Na Un-seon."

278
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,878
And the cover has a strong reddish hue,

279
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,798
but I was hoping for a softer vibe.

280
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,926
Overall, it lacks symmetry.

281
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,387
There's a 2 mm difference
between the left and right margins.

282
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,472
And I asked Hamchorong Batang
Extended Bold for the font,

283
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,933
but he just went with
Hamchorong Batang Extended.

284
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,602
Could you change it to
Hamchorong Batang Extended Bold instead?

285
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,191
-Is that all?
-Yes.

286
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,152
Didn't you say you're on a tight deadline?

287
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:21,948
Yes, so I need to ask you
to get this done by tomorrow.

288
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,410
That place over there is amazing.

289
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,622
No, him.

290
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,501
It wasn't me.

291
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,295
He needed it in
Hamchorong Batang Extended Bold.

292
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,172
Bold.

293
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,219
Go on.

294
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,850
He's worse than those TV station guys.

295
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,560
I thought you were
going to punch him, bro.

296
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,021
That's why I sent him away quickly.

297
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,272
It was a close call.

298
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,189
Good call.

299
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,983
If you punch guys like him,
all you get is a sore fist.

300
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,238
Oh, damn.

301
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,408
Why is that Hamchorong guy still here?

302
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,495
-Something's off about him.
-Why is he doing this to us?

303
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:10,747
Should I ward him off?

304
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,541
-He's so weird.
-Seriously.

305
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,293
I know I've seen him before.

306
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,713
"Good Detective Kang Pil-gu"?

307
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:22,091
What kind of title is that?
His name’s just as weird.

308
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,817
Wow, this punk…

309
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:42,987
He's a genius.

310
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,504
Damn it! What the hell?

311
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,342
Could you change it to
Hamchorong Batang Extended Bold instead?

312
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,637
Hamchorong?
Have you lost your mind, you punk?

313
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,097
You nearly gave me a heart attack!

314
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:10,765
I remember now.

315
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,018
What do you mean?

316
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,146
I knew I'd seen you before.

317
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,190
But I couldn't remember
even when I got home,

318
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,193
or even after I walked my dog
and took out the recyclables.

319
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,528
I was about to lose my damn mind.

320
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,655
But as soon as I lay down to sleep,

321
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,115
I remembered.

322
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,826
That movie, Sad Waltz.

323
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,994
You're an actor!

324
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:36,040
You came all the way back here
just to confirm that?

325
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,083
No.

326
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:38,876
I'm here to cast you.

327
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:42,672
Jeez.

328
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,217
I want you to be in my movie,
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,

329
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,262
as the main character,
Detective Kang Pil-gu.

330
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,774
Let's go.

331
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:02,817
Damn!

332
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:05,987
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

333
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,614
Hurry, let's go.

334
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,537
Hey, move! We're busy.

335
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,580
Come on.

336
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,540
Move it! We're busy!

337
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,376
You're saying the color bled?

338
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,211
And I told him…

339
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,173
Hello there!

340
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,758
We'll get it reprinted for you.

341
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,177
Yes, of course.

342
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,978
What the hell, man?

343
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,230
Mr. Leading Man,
are you just getting off work?

344
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:42,982
Come on, seriously?

345
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:44,775
What are you doing here?

346
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,986
-Go home already!
-I'll go after you take this.

347
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,362
Why are you here? Go away!

348
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,865
Mr. Leading Man,
would you please just consider…

349
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,617
I told you no already. Go away!

350
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,826
You didn't have to lock the door.

351
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,455
-There's no point in staying here. Go!
-Just help me out this once.

352
00:24:58,915 --> 00:24:59,957
Mr. Leading Man.

353
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,376
Seriously?

354
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,545
-I'm about to lose it.
-Mr. Leading Man?

355
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,130
No, stop calling me that!

356
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,632
Don't call me that, all right?

357
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,551
Mr. Lim, I really want you in my movie.

358
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,262
You go to a great school.

359
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,514
There must be a truckload of good actors
to choose from.

360
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,516
What makes you think
you can trust me with that role?

361
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,437
I get that it's just a graduation project,
but you can't afford to fail.

362
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,105
I'm doing this
to make sure it's a success.

363
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,775
Fine.

364
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,819
Let me ask you then.

365
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,781
Why do you want me
to play that aggressive detective?

366
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,699
Because you'll do a great job!

367
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,370
I'm not good at explaining things,
but that's why.

368
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,163
I can make it happen.

369
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,874
I'm confident that I can,
if you'll just let me.

370
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,670
I saw that there's
a ton of chase and fight scenes.

371
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,380
I can't even fight!

372
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,841
Pacifism runs in my DNA,
right down to the bone.

373
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,093
I'm busy, so go away.

374
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,219
Go away now!

375
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,973
Wait, you can't just throw that around!

376
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,266
Please handle it with care.

377
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,935
Goodness, Mr. Hwang. Don't drink too much.

378
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,229
Yes, thank you.

379
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,485
Come on, just do it.

380
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,904
Why are you being so difficult?

381
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:15,157
How many people would actually watch
an indie film made by a college student?

382
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,242
-For goodness' sake.
-Well,

383
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:20,079
what if someone watches it
and I end up being humiliated?

384
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:24,333
And why bother
if nobody's going to watch it anyway?

385
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,963
You know, I read the script too.

386
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,591
A story like that is rare to come by.

387
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,678
Look, forget the fact
that the director is inexperienced.

388
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,264
It's the kind of story that makes you
want to get right onto the set.

389
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,266
Tell me, is it not?

390
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,395
-It is.
-See?

391
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,987
Hey, remember when I was doing stage plays
and got recruited by the agency?

392
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:55,156
You were my first manager.

393
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,282
Right.

394
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,159
How was I back then?

395
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:00,369
You, bro?

396
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,872
You were…

397
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,373
different.

398
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,670
You had the potential to be a top star.

399
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:10,671
Yeah, right.

400
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,178
If only you hadn't dated Gwon Se-na,

401
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,972
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

402
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:24,727
That ungrateful little wench.

403
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,898
You broke up with her for her sake,
and she should be thankful for that.

404
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,108
Instead, she lied just to save face.

405
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,279
What's with that look?

406
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:38,157
Don't tell me you think
this indie film could suddenly turn you

407
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,077
into a world-famous movie star
or something.

408
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:42,661
I never said I was thinking that!

409
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,790
-Jeez, whatever.
-Why would you say that?

410
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,541
No need to get so angry.

411
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,629
Hey.

412
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:55,132
We started this print shop
with our bare hands

413
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,384
and made a name for ourselves.

414
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,676
Things are pretty good now, no?

415
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,513
Some people don't make
half as much as you do,

416
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,848
but they still buy cars,
play golf, and live it up.

417
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,600
But what do you do for yourself?

418
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:09,355
Just think of it as a hobby.

419
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,983
You deserve to do what you want
every now and then.

420
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:16,153
Don't worry
about the print shop, all right?

421
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,279
Leave it to me.

422
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,407
Imperial Print!

423
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,843
MR. LEADING MAN,
I'LL ASK YOU ONE LAST TIME.

424
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,804
PLEASE BE IN MY MOVIE.
IF YOU TURN ME DOWN AGAIN, I'LL STOP.

425
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,598
BUT I URGE THAT YOU CONSIDER IT
WITH A POSITIVE MINDSET.

426
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,864
Will I get paid?

427
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,581
"He spins the handcuffs
and swiftly fastens them onto X's wrists."

428
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,294
"They say you can't fix people."

429
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,296
"But…

430
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,673
I do."

431
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,635
"Then he collapses, sprawling next to X."

432
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,014
All right,
we'll wrap up our table read here.

433
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,057
Good job.

434
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:28,976
Good work, everyone.

435
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,901
Can I have a word with you?

436
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,444
Sure.

437
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,343
I overdid it earlier, didn't I?

438
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,224
-Mr. Lim.
-Yes?

439
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,143
Let me start by saying
that what I'm about to tell you

440
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:14,104
is meant for the sake of the movie,
and not to teach or lecture you.

441
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:17,066
Of course. Feel free to say whatever.

442
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,735
Don't be shy. Just tell me.

443
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,861
Before I do that,

444
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,239
I think we should decide on
how to address each other

445
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,324
as a sign of respect
for our respective roles.

446
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,034
Right. I see.

447
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,078
Okay.

448
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:31,956
You're right. Sounds good.

449
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,833
Sounds good, Director.

450
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,045
Mr. Lim.

451
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,673
How did you analyze the character?

452
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,050
Well…

453
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,011
He thinks violence
is the only way to deal with criminals.

454
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,516
And I think he has a troublemaker streak.

455
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:53,602
Sir.

456
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,440
How do you feel about him
fighting violence with violence?

457
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,861
Wouldn't it depend
on the level of violence?

458
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,989
On a case-by-case basis, no?

459
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,699
So his approach depends on the situation?

460
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,162
You're right. It shows in your acting.

461
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,207
It screams,
"I don't know if I'm doing this right,

462
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:19,169
but I'm trying to make the punching
and beating as natural as possible."

463
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:22,131
This character values his fists
over the law. Why?

464
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,092
Because his beliefs were
shaped by childhood experiences.

465
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:28,596
That's why this character feels no guilt
beating up bad guys.

466
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,431
To make this character authentic,

467
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,725
you have to fully trust
that your beliefs are right.

468
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,227
You have to become one with the character.

469
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,318
Yes, sir.

470
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,820
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

471
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,156
Bro, what are you doing?

472
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,908
We're swamped right now.

473
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,785
-Hurry up and drop off the orders.
-Okay.

474
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,751
They say you can't fix people.

475
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,419
But I do.

476
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,420
But I do.

477
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,505
But I do!

478
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,506
But I do!

479
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,427
Stop right there!

480
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:11,847
But I do.

481
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,240
Stop right there!

482
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:32,451
Stop.

483
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:35,371
Stop!

484
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,206
Stop right there!

485
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,011
Cut!

486
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,767
Has he lost his damn mind?

487
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,479
Who shoots a chase scene for three days?

488
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,067
Two and a half days, actually.

489
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:09,154
The only expression captured on camera
is total exhaustion.

490
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,785
Maybe it's because Kang Pil-gu
is damn exhausted.

491
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,161
Right, sir?

492
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:17,496
Wrong. Sure, it's hard.

493
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,082
But he has to show he's determined
to catch the bastard

494
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,000
and beat the hell out of him.

495
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,086
Let's go again.

496
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,972
Ready. Action!

497
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:38,684
Cut!

498
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:39,601
Action!

499
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,563
Cut!

500
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,480
Action!

501
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,777
You okay?

502
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,071
Don't stop.

503
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,699
Keep acting until I say cut.

504
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,331
All right, let's go again.

505
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,291
Ready!

506
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,084
Action!

507
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,843
Cut.

508
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,767
Mr. Lim, let's go again.

509
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,271
That bastard.

510
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,234
Ready. Action!

511
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,115
-What?
-Cut.

512
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,283
Damn it.

513
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,331
-You did great.
-Thank you.

514
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,383
Let's call it a day for the shoot.

515
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:58,972
But we're not done yet.

516
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,434
It seems you didn't fully prepare
for the character,

517
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:06,605
so we'll stop filming today
and reshoot this later.

518
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,732
-Clear the set, please.
-But…

519
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:10,567
Hey, hold on a second!

520
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,862
Are you out of your mind, Director?

521
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,406
This isn't some multi-billion-won
budget movie!

522
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,660
It's an indie film, so shoot it like one!

523
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,411
Why can't you be reasonable about this?

524
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,956
Why can't you read the room
or know your limits?

525
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,041
Are you taking this
to the Cannes Film Festival?

526
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,126
Not even Bong Joon-ho
or Park Chan-wook would go this far!

527
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,629
How would you know that?

528
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:34,758
It's not like you've worked with
those directors either, Mr. Lim.

529
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,426
What did you just say?

530
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,053
Get over here!

531
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,514
Why you little…

532
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,267
I've been speaking to you respectfully
and showing you respect as the director!

533
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,769
You were practically begging me
to be in your movie,

534
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:48,272
so I agreed
to be in your movie without pay!

535
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,982
So how dare you say that to me?

536
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,401
Had I known you were so bad at acting,

537
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,611
I wouldn't have persuaded you.

538
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:58,615
Is that so?

539
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,118
So you have a death wish, is that it?

540
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,746
Let's see how well you do on your own.

541
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,123
I'm out!

542
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,340
Cut. Again.

543
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,469
-What?
-Cut. Again.

544
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,597
Moving on to the next shot. Ready!

545
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,390
Action!

546
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,685
-What?
-Cut!

547
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,353
All right. Ready.

548
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:29,938
Action!

549
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:34,651
What?

550
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,403
It's all your fault, Detective Kang!

551
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,362
Let's go again!

552
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,072
Damn it, not again!

553
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,306
You punk!

554
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,799
They say you can't fix people.

555
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:41,677
But…

556
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,264
I do.

557
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,646
Cut! Okay!

558
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,439
-We're done!
-Yes!

559
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:57,359
And that's a wrap
for Good Detective Kang Pil-gu!

560
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,194
Good work, everyone!

561
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,246
Everyone, please fill your glass.

562
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,793
Thank you for all your hard work
while filming Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

563
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,045
Make sure to fill your bellies today!

564
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,049
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

565
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,844
-Cheers.
-Drink up!

566
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,053
Drink…

567
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,268
It's finally over.

568
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:32,728
Mr. Lim.

569
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,149
I know that I gave you
a really hard time while filming.

570
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,151
It's all my fault.

571
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,820
I know you're probably upset with me,

572
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,782
but I hope you'll accept this drink
and forget about it.

573
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,535
Hey.

574
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:00,464
Drink up.

575
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,632
Big applause for our leading man!

576
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,471
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

577
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:11,266
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

578
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,686
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

579
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,899
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

580
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,487
I'll have a drink.

581
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,626
I hope…

582
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:42,464
we never see each other again,
you little shit!

583
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,635
And the Best Actor award
goes to Lim Hyeon-jun

584
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,804
from Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

585
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,224
We'll now hear
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun's acceptance speech.

586
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,939
By some miracle,
I've been given a second chance…

587
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,900
and I won't let it slip away.

588
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,569
From now on,

589
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,365
I hope to act for a long time
alongside all of you…

590
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:16,373
in a way that will be remembered.

591
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,332
Thank you!

592
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,336
My life took a dramatic turn.

593
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,004
Thank you!

594
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,172
I'll do my very best.

595
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,298
Thank you!

596
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:26,383
Thank you.

597
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,762
My black-and-white, documentary-like life

598
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:34,432
turned into a romantic comedy
bursting with color.

599

JUST HOW FAR WILL IT GO?
HIGHEST RATINGS: 28.5%

609
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,597
What the hell?

610
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,973
Are you taking this out?

611
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,602
I just started it up
to keep the battery from dying out.

612
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,478
I mean,

613
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:24,149
I paid for this car myself,
so why can't I use it whenever I want?

614
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,068
Come on, everyone's watching you.

615
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:30,322
Take the company car
if you have a work appointment.

616
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:34,784
I need to play roles like a wealthy heir,
a successful lawyer, or a doctor.

617
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,205
That way, I won't look so out of place
driving a fancy car like that.

618
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,124
I'm always playing broke detectives.

619
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,002
No wonder people are shocked
when they see me in a car like that!

620
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,671
People don't see the real me anymore.

621
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,423
All they see is Detective Kang Pil-gu.

622
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,926
These days, I even mistake my own name
for Kang Pil-gu

623
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,969
instead of Lim Hyeon-jun.

624
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,429
All right, I get it.

625
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,807
Let's make sure your next project
reshapes your public image, bro.

626
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,561
Let's please make that happen, Mr. Hwang.

627
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:05,565
And don't call me "bro" in public.

628
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,903
But why? You are my big bro.

629
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,906
If you call me bro, it makes me look old.

630
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,283
Shouldn't a CEO like you
manage his actor's public image?

631
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:16,826
Seriously?

632
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,787
What about my public image, then?

633
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,376
Damn.

634
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,503
You have a great body.

635
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,047
Come to my room. I'll tip you really well.

636
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,299
You pretty little thing.

637
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,678
-Hands off.
-What?

638
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,429
Get lost.

639
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,101
Man, what's the matter with her?

640
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:47,691
Her name is Wi Jeong-sin,
and she's 36 years old.

641
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,776
She's been with Eunseongilbo for 12 years.

642
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,028
She's currently
the political desk's ace reporter.

643
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,366
She entered and graduated top of her class
in Media and Communication.

644
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,451
She speaks English, Chinese, and Arabic

645
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:00,036
and is fluent in all four languages.

646
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,497
Known for her incredible mental toughness,

647
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,041
she discovered crucial evidence
before the police

648
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,377
at a murder scene
involving a dismembered body

649
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,422
that made even a 20-year veteran detective
vomit and pass out.

650
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:14,050
She also climbed a 100-meter tower crane
to interview protestors

651
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:16,428
and played a key role in getting

652
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,722
all unfairly dismissed
construction workers reinstated.

653
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,643
As a war correspondent,

654
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:27,063
she was the first in the world to report
the horrors of the Serian Civil War.

655
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,159
After being caught in a bomb blast

656
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,911
that nearly led
to the amputation of her leg,

657
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:43,621
she had major surgery and barely survived.

658
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,793
And she became the youngest recipient of
the Korean Journalist of the Year award.

659
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:51,463
The Korean Journalist of the Year award
goes to Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

660
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,384

KOREAN JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR AWARD

663
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:04,976
DESK CHIEF
YUN HWA-YEONG

664
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,479
-Did you write up this report?
-Yes.

665
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,814
It's like a martial arts novel.
How is this real?

666
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,274
I don't believe it all, either.

667
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,944
But why come to the entertainment desk
at a sister paper

668
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,822
instead of the culture desk
at the main paper?

669
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:18,990
Isn't it obvious?

670
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,159
They wanted her gone.

671
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,372
Let's have a meeting.

672
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,873
-Now?
-Pardon?

673
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,627
See you later.

674
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,592
Your new hair color looks amazing.

675
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,677
Where did you get it done?

676
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,596
A hair salon at Cheongdam Intersection.

677
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,181
Are you new here?

678
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,725
No.

679
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,520
-Are you Bahn Soo-jung?
-Yes.

680
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,315
-How do you know me?
-You have a video, right?

681
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:56,486
On Friday, February 20th,
you went to entertain some VIPs

682
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,822
and took a video on your phone,
hoping it might pay off.

683
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,492
-Who are you?
-Me?

684
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:04,786
I'm a reporter.

685
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,789
Hey, Chief.

686
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,500
I got a scoop.

687
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,257
We hit 28%!

688
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,428
Our ratings were close to 30%
over the course

689
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,388
of four whole seasons!

690
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,765
I said 30%!

691
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:29,978
Thanks to Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,
my production company bought a building!

692
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,273
The TV stations said
making dramas wasn't profitable,

693
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,317
so they almost shut down
that entire business.

694
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:39,946
You can say that Kang Pil-gu
brought us back from the brink.

695
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,281
This might sound funny coming from me,

696
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,116
but Kang Pil-gu saved a lot of lives.

697
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,284
Exactly!

698
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:47,162
That's why we need
dramas like this to continue.

699
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,706
Remember that old drama, Country Diaries?

700
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,709
This drama needs to go on
for 10 to 20 years as well!

701
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:56,087
Look at American dramas,
like CSI and NCSI.

702
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:59,591
They have spin-offs based in Las Vegas,
Miami, and New York!

703
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:03,845
Add them all up, and you can't even count
how many seasons there are!

704
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:07,515
What's to stop Kang Pil-gu from running
for 10 or even 20 seasons?

705
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,100
You're absolutely right.

706
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:13,104
But all of that depends on
what our leading man decides to do.

707
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,993
Are you saying
I have to play a detective until I die?

708
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:31,039
Even Gil Grissom
from CSI: Vegas left the series

709
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,582
to try something different!

710
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,918
There's nothing left in my life

711
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,086
except for Kang Pil-gu!

712
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,004
I'm done!

713
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,640
I mean, of course…

714
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,726
I'd love to do it.

715
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,811
-Right?
-I knew it.

716
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,730
Kang Pil-gu forever!

717
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,399
It's much better to play Kang Pil-gu

718
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,069
than to be in an iffy rom-com
that only gets 2% ratings.

719
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,028
Of course.

720
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,448
-That's much better.
-Exactly.

721
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,076
But you know,

722
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,788
-I've been a bit scared these days.
-What?

723
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,790
If I want to last long as an actor,

724
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,833
I'm afraid my role as Kang Pil-gu

725
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:21,631
-must end here--
-That's because your acting is so good!

726
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,551
Like those mistresses
you see in soap operas.

727
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:27,512
Those actresses get slapped on the back
and cursed at by people on the street.

728
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,930
It's like a badge of honor.

729
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,015
-Of course, it is.
-Hello?

730
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,725
Hello?

731
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,936
Yes, of course. Excuse me.

732
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,938
Right.

733
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,232
Yes.

734
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:40,942
Oh, I see.

735
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,743
Excuse me, where's the restroom?

736
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:52,161
The restroom is over there.

737
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,289
Over there? Thank you.

738
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,803
Why is the lock broken?

739
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,112
Darn.

740
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,824
What if Mr. Lim
absolutely refuses to do it?

741
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,118
All he'll get right now
are iffy supporting roles.

742
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:35,079
Who will give him a role
in a melodrama or rom-com at his age?

743
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:36,247
He's stuck with Kang Pil-gu.

744
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:39,167
I think he's trying to
negotiate a higher pay.

745
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,085
So just play along for a bit.

746
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,100
What? A reporter snuck in?

747
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:58,353
What do you mean, a reporter came in?

748
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,647
Were you not monitoring the guests?

749
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:02,523
Wait, excuse me!

750
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:05,777
-Hey!
-Hey!

751
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,935
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry!

752
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,395
I'll leave soon. Just be quiet.

753
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,313
-This is the men's--
-Be quiet!

754
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:46,567
What's going on?

755
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,697
I'm really sorry,
but I'm going to have to step on you.

756
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:54,951
My leg! Watch my neck!

757
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:00,456
My neck!

758
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,174
My shoes!

759
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,593
Hurry up! Give me my shoes!

760
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:13,761
-Here.
-I'm sorry.

761
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,888
I'll cover the cost for your phone.
Call me at 0259-2151.

762
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:17,432
Give me a call. I'm really sorry!

763
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,308
My phone?

764
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:22,603
My phone!

765
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:23,771
Are you kidding me?

766
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,024
Seriously?

767
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,528
Damn it!

768
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,287
There's a crazy woman here.

769
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,206
Some crazy woman
came into the restroom and…

770
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:43,958
Is she a stalker?

771
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,086
Anyway, I just got attacked!

772
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,838
I had an upset stomach
and went to the restroom.

773
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,631
She came in all of a sudden,
stepped all over me,

774
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:51,924
and then disappeared…

775
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,677
And my phone fell in the toilet--

776
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:55,887
You're Kang Pil-gu!

777
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,513
You're Good Detective Kang Pil-gu, right?

778
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,227
Who knew I'd see you here, Detective?
It's such an honor!

779
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,354
I watched every single season.

780
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:07,774
Thank you.

781
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:09,859
So did someone barge into the restroom?

782
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,113
No, don't worry about it.

783
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,199
Go Kang Pil-gu!

784
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,709
All he'll get right now
are iffy supporting roles.

785
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:29,879
Who will give him a role
in a melodrama or rom-com at his age?

786
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,422
He's stuck with Kang Pil-gu.

787
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,809
What is it? Are you in a bad mood again?

788
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,394
I wouldn't have gone there
if I'd known what it was about.

789
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,854
A private hostess bar, no less.

790
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:49,774
I know. That's why I didn't tell you.

791
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:50,775
Mr. Hwang.

792
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:56,030
I mean it when I say
that I won't play Kang Pil-gu anymore.

793
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:59,534
Okay, I got it.
We'll talk about that later.

794
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,285
Will you be okay at the award ceremony?

795
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:04,330
I can tell you're worried,
taking those herbal calming pills.

796
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:08,251
Do I have to go to the award ceremony?

797
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,502
I'm not even getting one.

798
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:17,635
You received an award last year,
so now it's your turn to give one.

799
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,136
I'm sick right now.

800
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:22,765
Come on, I'm in pain.

801
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:25,351
Fine. Take some more pills.

802
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,280
Blown away

803
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:40,074
In the wind--

804
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,759
OBTAINED HOSTESS ENTERTAINMENT VIDEO

805
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,219
NO CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

806
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:11,105
WOO YOUNG-SUK, AIDE

807
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,233
Does Assemblyman Ha
really have nothing to do

808
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,152
with the redevelopment in Cheongwon City?

809
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:19,280
Are you saying his aide
took all that money for himself?

810
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,407
Mr. Woo, an aide
to Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan,

811
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,700
was found dead.

812
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,785
Officials are considering
the possibility of suicide.

813
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,914
Mr. Woo's family
wants to avoid escalating the issue.

814
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:29,749
So if you keep poking around,

815
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,835
a lot of people will get hurt, understand?

816
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:58,486
WOO YOUNG-SUK

817
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,202
You're here again, Ms. Wi.

818
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:08,913
It's been a long time.

819
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,082
It's already been seven years.

820
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:14,293
You really don't have to come anymore.

821
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,879
Thank you for everything.

822
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,675
It's not over yet.

823
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,553
I'll find out what Mr. Woo wanted to say

824
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,682
and how his death was staged as a suicide.

825
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,061
I'll get to the bottom of it.

826
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:33,938
EUNSEONGILBO

827
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:43,322
My apologies, sir.

828
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:45,658
I trust you'll take care of that reporter.

829
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,368
Yes, sir. Understood.

830
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:50,663
A sports tabloid?

831
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:54,917
Get back to work, everyone.

832
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,087
Just work the entertainment desk
for a year, okay?

833
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,046
The entertainment desk?

834
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,425
You're bumping me to the sports tabloid,
and not even for a transfer?

835
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:05,261
But you saw that video, Chief.
It's a major scoop!

836
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,096
The video barely shows any faces,

837
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,640
and there aren't any audible voices,
so how is that a scoop?

838
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,309
I understand why you want to
sweep this under the rug.

839
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:15,479
But let's be honest, Chief.
You recognized who it was.

840
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:17,398
Hey.

841
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,234
One wrong move,
and your petty desire for fame

842
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,153
will land us in hot water.

843
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,822
Do you want to see
the entire political desk get wiped out?

844
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,366
Do you cherry-pick articles
to write for your petty paycheck?

845
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,743
What the hell did you say?

846
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,078
You just crossed the line.
How dare you say that?

847
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:34,874
I'm a political reporter.

848
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,293
I refuse to be forced

849
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:39,420
to work the entertainment desk.

850
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:45,009
That little brat…

851
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,428
But why is she coming?

852
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,556
They've been looking for ways
to get rid of her for a while.

853
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,058
She's addicted to work

854
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,976
and has absolutely no social skills.

855
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,478
I hear she's really unlikeable.

856
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,188
Hey, we're not a damage control team!

857
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:01,358
That's enough. Stop making a big deal
out of someone joining us.

858
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,612
How come none of you seem worried
after writing such a lousy story today?

859
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,532
The Geumsang Arts Awards is today, right?

860
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:12,536
Find out who wore similar dresses
or who was a fashion disaster,

861
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,246
and write it up before the ceremony.

862
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:19,085
The battle of the red carpet dresses.
Who will be the winners and losers?

863
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:25,007
First, the organizer of this ceremony
and the one who made today possible.

864
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,551
Chairman Lee Dae-ho, a young leader

865
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:29,637
-guiding the industry forward.
-Chairman!

866
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,931
-With an aura that could rival an actor,
-Chairman!

867
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,224
he's stepped onto the red carpet.

868
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:35,684
Chairman Lee Dae-ho!

869
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,436
I'm from the political desk!

870
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,271
Sir! Chairman Lee!

871
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,192
Excuse me, Chairman Lee!

872
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:45,361
I'm from the political desk!

873
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,780
Sir! Chairman Lee!

874
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:53,536
Don't miss out on the man making
an appearance on the red carpet now.

875
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:58,082
He's successfully led the drama,
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

876
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,835
Last year, he won the Best Actor award

877
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:04,255
-at the Geumsang Arts Awards…
-Chairman Lee Dae-ho!

878
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,756
Please comment on
the retaliatory personnel decisions

879
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,216
taking place at Eunseongilbo!

880
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:09,009
Where are you from?

881
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:10,219
I'm Wi Jeong-sin from the political desk!

882
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,680
You've been avoiding my calls
and refusing to meet me,

883
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,557
so I was forced to come here!

884
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,975
-Let's talk next time.
-Sir!

885
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,018
Please cancel my personnel transfer!

886
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:19,353
We'll talk next time.

887
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:21,856
Excuse me.

888
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,992
Mr. Lim!

889
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,104
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

890
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,317
Of course, I'm struggling.

891
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:32,319
You must have a bad memory.

892
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,488
We actually met in a very dramatic way.

893
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,700
There's no way this woman is a reporter.

894
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,743
You can't embarrass a reporter like that!

895
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,870
-Do you want to bury Lim Hyeon-jun?
-Yes!

896
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:45,082
Everyone has dirt to hide,
and where there's smoke, there's fire.

897
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:48,669
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin will not be allowed
to take part in this interview.

898
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,921
Groveling at my feet
wouldn't have been enough!

899
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:52,673
I'm just returning the favor.

900
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,384
This reporter is a damn lunatic!

901
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,764
