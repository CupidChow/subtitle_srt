ACTOR HYEON-JUN,
SHOCKING RED CARPET MISHAP

00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,086
LIM HYEON-JUN'S RED UNDERWEAR DISASTER

3
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,300
THIS IS FUN!

4
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,848
THIS IS EXCITING!

5
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,907
Stop watching this. Are you a pain-seeker?

6
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,575
Why are you torturing yourself like this?

7
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,249
You're taking another one?

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,168
Are you still struggling?

9
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,962
I was attacked in a restroom

10
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:11,590
and humiliated at the awards ceremony,
so of course, I'm struggling.

11
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,217
I get that.

12
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,429
But that woman wasn't even a terrorist.
Did you think she'd pull out a knife?

13
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,265
Why did you even rush toward her?

14
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,850
This is all because of Kang Pil-gu!

15
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,269
I deal with so many bad guys in the show

16
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,729
that it's hard to separate it
from real life!

17
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:29,275
Still, you looked really cool
when you ran toward her,

18
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,484
even though you took a tumble.

19
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:33,362
-Do you know what a painfinity meme is?
-A painfinity meme?

20
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,822
I have no idea.

21
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,032
It's a meme that causes infinite pain.

22
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,161
I just created
a forever-cringe moment in my life!

23
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,540
It's all right.

24
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,042
Why did you have to go and fall down?

25
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:48,669
It'll be okay.

26
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,714
Everyone says
they hated the red underwear.

27
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,341
Everyone will forget soon.

28
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:57,469
Man, why did I have to
wear that underwear that night?

29
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,014

GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU
TAKES DOWN FEMALE ATTACKER

34
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,314
I enjoyed the awards ceremony
thanks to you.

35
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,193
It makes me sad to hear that.

36
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,613
I risked my job as a reporter
to go there, you know.

37
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,200
They say a monk can leave the temple
if they don't like it.

38
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,870
I'd like to know how you feel
about being forced to come here.

39
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:07,998
It sucks.

40
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,084
I see.

41
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,920
You'll be covering K-pop here.
Do you have a favorite artist?

42
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,506
-No.
-Watched any dramas or movies recently?

43
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,008
-No.
-Do you know any drama titles?

44
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:21,136
-No.
-Do you know who RedPink is?

45
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,348
Oh, right!

46
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,474
No.

47
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,769
You've got some nerve, just as I heard.

48
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,229
It's unfortunate, though.

49
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,816
You might've been
the political desk's ace reporter.

50
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:34,942
But here,

51
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:35,901
you're just a newbie.

52
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,866
Listen carefully.
High-and-mighty journalism?

53
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,077
We don't need that crap here,
so leave it at home.

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,914
You know the line between gossip
and journalism is paper-thin.

55
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,625
But that paper-thin line
can change the world.

56
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,419
So are you saying
an entertainment reporter

57
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,379
isn't as cool as other reporters?

58
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,382
-I didn't become a reporter to be cool.
-Good.

59
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,551
Try to do well here too.

60
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,636
You know,

61
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,639
I do well wherever I go.

62
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,268
I have high standards.

63
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,145
You'll need to do extremely well.

64
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,230
You can go now.

65
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,316
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5
PROJECT PROPOSAL

66
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,781
You know, in my opinion,

67
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,243
I think this season
will be a bit different than before.

68
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,831
Mr. Hwang.

69
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,050
-Mr. Hwang!
-Yes, I'm coming.

70
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,468
You guys can go home now.

71
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,272
Didn't I tell you
season four was the last one?

72
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,483
Do you think we're in Hollywood?

73
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,235
Is Good Detective Kang Pil-gu
the only role I get before I die?

74
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,029
Come on, bro.

75
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,448
We don't have to go to Hollywood for that.

76
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,325
Even Chief Inspector lasted for 18 years.

77
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,410
It was Choi Bul-am's
life-defining character.

78
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,205
That was more than 40 years ago!

79
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,665
That show ended
before you even learned to read!

80
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,584
In any case, I won't do the next season.

81
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,002
I'm doing something different.

82
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,713
We must've received
synopses for other shows!

83
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,651
What's this?

84
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,945
Is this it? Just this one?

85
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,822
It's a melodrama, your favorite.

86
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,323
A melodrama?

87
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,574
It's set in the '80s,

88
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,618
and the male lead
is a post office employee.

89
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,578
He develops a crush on a woman

90
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:55,165
who comes every day
to send letters to her dead boyfriend and…

91
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,500
Jeez, it's too complex.

92
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,877
Hey, that sounds great.

93
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,047
Yes, it's great.
The post office employee is Zo In-sung.

94
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,591
You're the dead boyfriend.
Still interested?

95
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,679
Do I get little screen time?

96
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,057
There's not much to say
because you die and disappear.

97
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,684
You might have about three scenes.

98
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,270
It's more like a special appearance.

99
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,522
And before he died, he was a detective.

100
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,192
A detective who was stabbed to death
by a serial killer.

101
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,403
What else is there?

102
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,281
Why did you only bring this?

103
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,991
There must be more, right?

104
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,617
Bring them all so I can choose.

105
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,997
We haven't gotten anything else.

106
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,250
No other scripts have come in.

107
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,003
If scripts don't come in,
you need to reach out first!

108
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,838
If I'm just waiting for scripts to arrive,

109
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,048
why would I need an agency?

110
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,009
You're right.
It's my fault for being incompetent.

111
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:48,802
I'm sorry, bro.

112
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,681
People probably think
I'm too busy playing Kang Pil-gu.

113
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,600
That's why they're not sending me scripts.

114
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:59,146
Send out articles saying
I'm done playing Kang Pil-gu.

115
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,084
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

116

GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU
SEASON 18

117
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,697
Excuse me, sir.

118
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,492
I never expected to meet you here.

119
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,662
I'm sorry to bother you,
but can I get an autograph?

120
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,747
My daughter is a big fan.

121
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,667
Sure.

122
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,753
What's your daughter's name?

123
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,588
It's Yu Je-i.

124
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,006
What a pretty name.

125
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,804
No, but really, my daughter is a huge fan

126
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,764
of Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong.

127
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,684
Gosh, you retired too early.

128
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,477
If it weren't for that injury…

129
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,521
Goodness, I'm being silly. I'm sorry.

130
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,730
It's okay.

131
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,115
It's Yu Je-i.

132
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,578
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

133
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,872
Did you get it?

134
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,096
So after her divorce,

135
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,350
Song Ja-gyeong got so much botox done
that her face was about to explode!

136
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,813
So the next entertainment piece can be
a full story of Song Ja-gyeong's divorce…

137
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,233
I interviewed Song Si-gyeong yesterday,

138
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,443
and his voice was so amazing.

139
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,779
I almost asked him if he could say
"Sweet dreams" to me.

140
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,364
Oh, man.

141
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,200
Start the meeting.

142
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,955
-Broadcasting?
-Chae-eun from Latiseri

143
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,415
landed a role in an SBS mini series.

144
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,209
I guess the other girl group member
was turned down.

145
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,837
-Any K-pop news?
-Ga-i arrives today after his US concert.

146
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,090
He's releasing his fifth studio album,
so people will be interested.

147
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:35,385
Cover his arrival scene
and get an interview, Wi Jeong-sin.

148
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,096
Me?

149
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,224
You cover K-pop.

150
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,394
Do you know who Ga-i…

151
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,355
Do you have a clue?

152
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,065
-I'm sure she does.
-Of course.

153
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,149
-She'd know.
-It's Ga-i, after all.

154
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,318
-You can find him online.
-It's Ga-i.

155
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,580
-Hey, wait a second. What's this?
-What?

156
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,498
What is it?

157
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,208
PRODUCTION UNDERWAY
FOR GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU SEASON 5!

158
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,461
This isn't the article I wanted released!
What's the matter with you?

159
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,420
It wasn't me.

160
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,589
-Who else could it be but…
-Move, please.

161
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,299
What's going on?
Are you guys escorting the president?

162
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,009
What's with the heavy security?

163
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,261
It's Ga-i!

164
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,764
He just arrived today
after his US concert.

165
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,641
How many bodyguards does he have?

166
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,227
I bet there are
tons of reporters out there.

167
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,522
Hey, you should've told me about this!

168
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,109
If I walk out with Ga-i,
I'll look like a loser!

169
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,070
Don't worry about a thing.
No one will pay any attention to you!

170
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,449
Have you lost your mind?

171
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,161
It won't be a problem. Just wear these.

172
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:44,746
Jeez.

173
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,301
WELCOME TO TERMINAL 2, ARRIVAL GATE B

174
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,804
What in the world?

175
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,722
So many are here already.

176
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,574
Move out of the way! I need to see…

177
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,992
No, don't push me!

178
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,957
Get that woman away from him!

179
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,127
-Protect Ga-i from her!
-Get off of him!

180
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,296
Someone help me!

181
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,677
Excuse me!

182
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,013
Please help me!

183
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,016
-Me?
-Excuse me, please help!

184
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,102
Help!

185
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,730
Hey, I need help!

186
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,441
Help me out!

187
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,860
Please save me!

188
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,785
Man, Ga-i had his car waiting
at the entrance and got right in.

189
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,580
Why do I have to walk
to the parking lot to get to mine?

190
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,624
Come on, Detective Kang Pil-gu

191
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,792
-doesn't have a sense of entitlement.
-Oh, hey.

192
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,377
We have your public image to consider.

193
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,964
-I wonder if that woman is okay.
-Yeah, I wonder.

194
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,884
Ga-i's fans practically dragged her away.

195
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,844
It's not like they'll kill her.

196
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,179
-You're going home, right?
-Yeah.

197
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,306
-Hey, go ahead. I'm leaving.
-Right.

198
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,682
I need to stop off somewhere.

199
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:28,725
Hey, Mr. Bak.

200
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,268
Are you at your studio?

201
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,104
I was hoping to see you today.

202
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,356
Get going.

203
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,857
-We'll be going now.
-Yeah.

204
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,193
All right.

205
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,155
Drive safely.

206
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,156
Drive safely, okay?

207
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,742
Be safe!

208
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,286
-Hands off!
-Get out of the way!

209
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,080
-No pushing!
-Move out of the way!

210
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:50,997
I said, move!

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,168
What do you think you're doing?

212
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,337
Are you okay?

213
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,838
She just fell!

214
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,507
Jeez.

215
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,092
Are you here to push people around?

216
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,345
If you're here to guard someone,
do that instead of getting physical!

217
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,556
You're only disgracing
the artist you're bodyguarding!

218
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,016
Look at what you're doing.
Do you think you're a bunch of thugs?

219
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,184
Are you kidding me?

220
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,978
What if she'd gotten seriously hurt?

221
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,438
Would you have compensated her?
Apologize right now.

222
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,148
I said apologize!

223
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,321
Why don't you check and see
if anything's broken or missing?

224
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,365
Everything is fine, thanks to you.

225
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,616
Thank you for getting my bag.

226
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,912
I saw how you didn't let
those bodyguards push you around.

227
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,375
Well, my pride won't allow me
to get pushed around by jerks like that.

228
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,757
Are you sure you're okay?
Your jacket's torn.

229
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,384
I'm fine.

230
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,761
My body's a little sore,
but I don't think I'm hurt.

231
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,600
Why are you laughing?

232
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,186
Is this situation funny to you?

233
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,105
No.

234
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,110
No, it's not funny at all.

235
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,699
I almost got to hold his hand.

236
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,118
-Did you get into a fight with the fans?
-There she is!

237
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,286
No.

238
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,206
-It's her!
-It's her. Let's go and see.

239
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,042
Get that woman away from him!

240
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,544
-Protect Ga-i from her!
-Get off of him!

241
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,671
Get away from him, woman!

242
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,173
-Grab that woman!
-No, I didn't…

243
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,679
Run!

244
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,724
Get her!

245
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,976
-It's her!
-Stop!

246
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,086
He had nothing to do with it.

247
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,754
-Just talk to me.
-Sorry?

248
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,548
You got us all wrong.
We're here to thank you.

249
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,343
The girl those bodyguards pushed earlier

250
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,928
is my friend.

251
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,014
Thank you for helping us.

252
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,516
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

253
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,560
Thank you for fighting on our behalf.
You were freaking amazing!

254
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,521
-You were a hero!
-You're the best!

255
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,106
We have to get going now.

256
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,816
Goodbye and thank you!

257
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:23,733
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

258
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,859
-Come on, guys.
-Let's go!

259
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,495
Were you trying to protect me just now?

260
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,621
Yes.

261
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,792
But I guess we ran for nothing.

262
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,171
Oh, right.
I'm supposed to cover his arrival.

263
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,464
Damn it, I'm screwed!

264
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,467
By the way,
thank you for picking up my bag.

265
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,427
Goodbye!

266
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,137
Hey, wait…

267
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,684
Hey, wait! You…

268
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,688
WI JEONG-SIN, SPORTS EUNSEONG

269
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,608
Now, stretch your back. Very nice.

270
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,527
Now, let's lower your left leg first.

271
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,323
Nicely done, sir.

272
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,037
I can't believe this.

273
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,711
You must have written a ton of scripts,

274
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,713
seeing how you have time for Pilates.

275
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,757
Writing takes a lot of energy, you know.

276
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,425
I make time for it even when I'm busy.

277
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,010
Didn't you say

278
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,971
you were going to take a year off
after season four

279
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,181
and focus on directing?

280
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,807
Have you given up on directing?

281
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,268
Who knew I'd be writing for so long?

282
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,103
When we decided to
turn Kang Pil-gu into a drama series,

283
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,647
I should've done the directing as well.

284
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,194
If you had,
Kang Pil-gu wouldn't be here today

285
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,237
because I wouldn't have done it.

286
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,075
Anyway, I'm still under contract
with the production company,

287
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,161
so I can't just do whatever I want.

288
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,164
Say you can't do it.

289
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,084
Darn, I got a bruise.

290
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,420
This is going to last for a while.

291
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,759
-Someone help me!
-Get that woman away from him!

292
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,969
Get off of him!

293
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,597
-Move!
-You scared Ga-i!

294
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,349
Please help me!

295
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,850
Come on, help me!

296
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,902
-Turn off the light.
-Yes, sir.

297
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,368
Let's see here.

298
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,038
LIM HYEON-JUN TAKES DOWN ASSAILANT

299
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,253
AWARDS CEREMONY RED CARPET BRAWL

300
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,052
Right!

301
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,679
It was that punk from before.

302
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,686
-Pil-gu.
-Pil-gu?

303
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,272
This guy's name is Pil-gu?

304
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,732
Are you serious?

305
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,652
Jeong-sin, you're covering entertainment.

306
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,654
I'm saying this
as a concerned younger brother,

307
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,739
but you need to know
the names of famous actors.

308
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,241
He's an actor?

309
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,285
Let me tell you about our dear Pil-gu.

310
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,996
His real name is Lim Hyeon-jun,
but he's better known as Kang Pil-gu.

311
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,249
He shaped the success of all four seasons
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

312
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,375
He's a flawless,

313
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,252
undisputed iconic actor.

314
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,713
An "iconic actor"?

315
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,339
One among many.

316
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,718
And his character speaks for itself.
He's like the next Yu Jae-seok.

317
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,472
Throw a fit and tell them you can't do it.

318
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,599
Throw a fit?

319
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,059
Just tell them you can't do it.

320
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,520
What will they do
if both the actor and writer refuse?

321
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,980
Come on.

322
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,442
I have a certain social standing
and reputation to maintain now,

323
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,443
and you're telling me to throw a fit?

324
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,611
That'll make me look like a jerk.

325
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,738
You're not the only one
with a public image to protect.

326
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,825
Wow, I'm so glad you brought that up.

327
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,412
An actor's public image is everything,
but starting with your graduation project

328
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,498
and the Kang Pil-gu drama series,
it's been six, no…

329
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,502
I played Kang Pil-gu
for seven whopping years!

330
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,463
No one's sending me scripts
for anything else!

331
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,132
-This is a huge decision for me too!
-Mr. Lim.

332
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,885
Do you think I'm the only writer in Korea?

333
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:19,886
Even if I tell them no,

334
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,805
they'll just find someone else
to write the next season.

335
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,308
The copyright belongs to the writer,

336
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,226
so you can just say you won't do it.

337
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,855
To tell you the truth,

338
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,484
I bought a small building last year

339
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,445
and took out a huge loan for it.

340
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,199
Mr. Bak.

341
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,993
I mean, Byeong-gi.

342
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,995
-Why don't you kill me off instead?
-Come on.

343
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,122
Just kill me off in the first episode.

344
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,084
Yes, let's kill Kang Pil-gu!

345
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,712
Come on, we're talking about us here!
You can do this for me, right?

346
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,798
The next Yu Jae-seok, my ass.

347
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,926
I just mean
there's nothing to dig up on him.

348
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,262
-That's due to a lack of proper digging.
-So what?

349
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,766
That idiot caused a scene that day
because he thought I was a criminal.

350
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,852
And thanks to him,
I got bumped to the sports tabloid!

351
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,729
Come on. That was decided days ago--

352
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,732
There was a chance I didn't have to
if it hadn't been for this!

353
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,609
Kang Pil-gu?

354
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,790
HAEUN BANK
FAIR AND ETHICAL BANKING, HAEUN FEEL MONEY

355
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,088
Damn it.

356
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,512
Sir, are you crying?

357
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,893
I've become a slave to Kang Pil-gu!

358
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,105
Come on, seriously.

359
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:59,027
There's no escaping him, damn it!

360
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,489
Goddamn it.

361
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,710
-Mother!
-My son!

362
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,546
-Sit down.
-Okay.

363
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,299
You didn't have to make
such a huge meal at this hour.

364
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,053
I'm so sorry,

365
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,013
but I have to head out for a shoot.

366
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,767
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

367
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,393
By the way,
when's your induction ceremony?

368
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,105
I'd like to skip it altogether.

369
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,024
I don't want to make a fuss.

370
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,276
I just want to go to work quietly.

371
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:09,305
This video of you
getting dragged by Ga-i's fans

372
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,057
is trending on UTube.

373
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:13,726
I saw it too.

374
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,770
You said you do well anywhere.
Is this what you meant?

375
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,565
We were the only ones
who missed Ga-i's arrival scene.

376
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,984
Just our paper!

377
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,153
You're out of K-pop coverage.

378
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,863
Lim Hyeon-jun's interview is today, right?

379
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,865
-Yes, it's at 2 p.m. at King's Back--
-Kang Pil-gu?

380
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,535
You know about Lim Hyeon-jun?

381
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,746
-Yes. I'll go.
-Why?

382
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,794
To make up for yesterday's mistake.

383
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,632
I'm Lee Jae-hyeong,
your newly appointed president.

384
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,592
I plan to develop Sports Eunseong

385
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:50,054
into a global sports tabloid
that can spread and share

386
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,557
Korea's diverse entertainment,
culture, and sports news,

387
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,101
all in real-time
with people around the world.

388
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,027
WI JEONG-SIN, SPORTS EUNSEONG

389
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,699
SPORTS EUNSEONG
WI JEONG-SIN

390
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,118
-As for the…
-You found all the materials, right?

391
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,580
-Yes, but…
-Then hurry up and send it out.

392
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,916
You have a video, right?

393
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,417
You went to entertain some VIPs

394
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,545
and took a video on your phone,
hoping it might pay off.

395
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,964
I'll need you to give it to me.

396
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,424
Who are you?

397
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,383
Me?

398
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,427
I'm a reporter.

399
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,275
Nice to meet you.

400
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:28,736
-I'm Wi Jeong-sin.
-Of course.

401
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,154
Thank you.

402
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,198
Right.

403
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,118
Here. I'm Hwang Ji-sun.

404
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,497
-All right. Please take a seat.
-Thank you.

405
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:44,502
Great.

406
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,381
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin.

407
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,800
It's our first time, right?

408
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,594
First time? You must have a bad memory.

409
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:56,472
We actually met in a very dramatic way.

410
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,765
Twice, in fact.

411
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,812
By the way, is Bahn Soo-jung
an actress with King's Back?

412
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,274
Yes, Soo-jung is a newcomer
who joined us last year.

413
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,535
Hold on.

414
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,120
Be quiet!

415
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:20,663
You!

416
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,208
I'll cover the cost for your phone.
Call me at 0259-2151.

417
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,918
Give me a call. I'm really sorry!

418
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,670
Are you really a reporter?

419
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:33,551
-Is this even real?
-Excuse me?

420
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,719
-Look here.
-Goodness.

421
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,471
Do you know what happens
if you impersonate a reporter?

422
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:40,933
What's this guy talking about?

423
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,352
Mr. Hwang, call Sports Eunseong right now.

424
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,563
And check her ID.

425
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,524
There's no way

426
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,235
this woman is a reporter.

427
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:52,903
Excuse me!

428
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:55,531
Wow.

429
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:57,366
Ms. Wi.

430
00:26:58,826 --> 00:26:59,827
We're very sorry.

431
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,956
There's been a misunderstanding.

432
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,624
Mr. Lim.

433
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:07,752
Right.

434
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:12,465
My job entails doing things
I've never done before.

435
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,508
So I overreacted. I'm sorry.

436
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,470
Right. I'm glad we cleared up
the misunderstanding.

437
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,638
So, can I ask you some questions?

438
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,931
Yes, of course.

439
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,687
So…

440
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:30,232
Mr. Lim, out of all the work you've done,
with the exception of Kang Pil-gu,

441
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,610
can you name your favorite project?

442
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,202
Well,

443
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,790
Kang Pil-gu is the only project
I've ever worked on.

444
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:51,670
I also did a movie called Sad Waltz
a long time ago,

445
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,298
but it's a little awkward to choose

446
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,842
between the two.

447
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,719
I see. All right, then.

448
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:04,392
Shall we start talking about
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu?

449
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,769
Yes, that sounds good.

450
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,854
Which season?

451
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:10,606
Excuse me?

452
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:15,694
There are multiple seasons.
Which one should we begin with?

453
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,573
Well…

454
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,618
The most recent one, of course.

455
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,286
What are your thoughts?

456
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,417
Wow.

457
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,294
That ended six months ago,
and you're asking me about my thoughts?

458
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,214
This is a bit underwhelming.

459
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,259
Your thoughts can be different
right after filming

460
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,844
and can change again after six months.

461
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,346
Yes, of course.

462
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,272
Right. Of course.

463
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,483
The last season

464
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,111
ended with me falling off a building.

465
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,658
It ended without revealing
whether I died or not.

466
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,119
Yes, it was quite suspenseful.

467
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,667
Wow, Ms. Wi.

468
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,920
-You haven't watched the drama.
-Excuse me?

469
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,674
The last season ended
with Kang Pil-gu getting promoted

470
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,301
after catching a serial killer.

471
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,846
Gosh, I guess you were so busy

472
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,475
that you didn't even have time
to skim the plot summary on your way here.

473
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,351
Well, this is unfortunate.

474
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,854
Since you're not clear on the content,
I guess the interview

475
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:34,148
will have to end here.

476
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,651
You see, I…

477
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:38,777
I understand.

478
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,571
It's a real shame,

479
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,324
but let's do this interview next time.

480
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,244
Come on.

481
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:51,207
With so many seasons,
anyone could get confused.

482
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,169
Did he just make a fool out of me?

483
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,965
Are you crazy?

484
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,884
That interview was so hard to land,
and you blew it?

485
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,264
Damn it, what's the matter with you?

486
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,391
Have you lost your mind?

487
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,852
You can't embarrass a reporter like that!

488
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,646
I did no such thing.

489
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,190
She wasn't prepared,
so I taught her a lesson.

490
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,401
What gives you the right
to teach a reporter a lesson?

491
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,530
Do you know what that woman does?

492
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,741
-What do you mean? She's a reporter!
-That woman

493
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,160
works at a hostess bar.

494
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:29,954
What?

495
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,458
Jeez.

496
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,046
-Where are you?
-Home, why? I'm busy.

497
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,840
Round up your theater and film friends
from college

498
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,759
who are experts in juicy gossip.

499
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,803
Round them up?
Do you think you're a gang boss?

500
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,137
I've got a high-paying gig for you.
Are you in?

501
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,305
Of course, I'm in!

502
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,349
-How many people do you need?
-Forget it.

503
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,892
The story might get leaked,
so do it yourself.

504
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,477
Damn it.

505
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,436
Hello?

506
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,523
Jeez, her phone manners are the worst.

507
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,986
This protein shake is tasty. Drink it.

508
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,070
Was that your sister?

509
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,823
Yeah, she said she has a gig for me.

510
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,076
-A gig? Can I do it too?
-I guess you could…

511
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,787
No, never mind.

512
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,498
It's probably not for
a privileged med student like you.

513
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,376
By the way,
why don't you have a TV at home?

514
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,129
My sister hates it. She's a total boomer.

515
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,090
-My brother's a boomer too.
-Really?

516
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,343
Well, what does your brother do?

517
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,220
-My brother?
-Is he a doctor?

518
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,766
His job starts with a "D" too.

519
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,851
He's a detective.

520
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,939
A detective? Like Kang Pil-gu?

521
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,108
Right.

522
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,660
Mr. Lim, out of all the work you've done,
with the exception of Kang Pil-gu,

523
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,371
can you name your favorite project?

524
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,498
Who will give him a role
in a melodrama or rom-com at his age?

525
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,167
He's stuck with Kang Pil-gu.

526
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,002
We don't get any.

527
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,795
No scripts have come in.

528
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:08,469
LIM HYEON-JUN
LIM HYEON-JUN, YOU'RE DEAD

529
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,930
Starting now,

530
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:15,434
dig through Lim Hyeon-jun's social media
and find dirt on him

531
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,312
with a female celebrity
or find any signs of dating.

532
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,190
Jeong-sin,
why are you going after my bro Pil-gu?

533
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,608
Lim Hyeon-jun gave me something.

534
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,652
I'm just returning the favor.

535
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,904
What exactly did he give you?

536
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:31,408
Humiliation.

537
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,413
Jeong-sin.

538
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:37,915
Do you know what a PSS is?

539
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,166
Of course, you don't.

540
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,210
It means, "Positive-Story Superstar."

541
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,961
That's the kind of person he is!

542
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,046
Positive story?

543
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,964
What positive stories?

544
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:50,636
First off, he still drives a domestic car.

545
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,725
The car needs to…

546
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,103
That car has been sitting there for ages.

547
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,646
Who does it belong to?

548
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,774
He was the first to cut rent in half
during COVID-19.

549
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,442
COVID-19 ended ages ago!

550
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,903
How much longer
do I have to be a "good landlord"?

551
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,406
I'm paying more in monthly interest
than I'm getting in rent!

552
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,700
And he has the nicest personality.

553
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,119
Nobody has ever seen him get angry.

554
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,453
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

555
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:20,958
I'm so sorry.

556
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,711
And that's not all.

557
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,671
He's the best
when it comes to fan service.

558
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,673
-It's Kang Pil-gu!
-Can I get an autograph?

559
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,341
-It's Kang Pil-gu!
-I'm a fan!

560
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:37,891
-Pil-gu!
-Pil-gu!

561
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,564
You know,

562
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:47,443
with a decade as a reporter covering
the social, political, and economic desks,

563
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,737
I've pretty much seen everything.

564
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,697
But I've come to realize something.

565
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,407
Everyone has dirt to hide,

566
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,284
and where there's smoke, there's fire.

567
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,161
My senior colleagues
at the political desk said

568
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,079
politicians and celebrities are similar.

569
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,457
I understand what politicians are like
more than anyone.

570
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,209
Therefore, you can say
I understand celebrities too.

571
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,046
There's always another side to them,
unknown to the public.

572
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,215
It's a hidden side that no one knows about

573
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:13,385
and is far from beautiful.

574
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,803
Do you really have to do this?

575
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,474
-One million won.
-What?

576
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,228
One million won is calling my name!

577
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,068
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

578
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,279
What kind of actor do you like?

579
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:36,325
I'm not capable
of favoring specific actors,

580
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:40,245
but I respect their acting abilities
and the narratives they bring to life.

581
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,163
In particular,

582
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:45,292
I highly value actors who have
successfully portrayed various characters.

583
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,251
Are you saying

584
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,714
someone who has played
only one character isn't an actor?

585
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,508
I didn't catch that.

586
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,723
So even an AI assistant like you
feels that way.

587
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,018
I want to play different characters too,

588
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,728
but nobody's giving me a chance.

589
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,148
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

590
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,651
Do you think I'll get an opportunity…

591
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,237
to play a variety of roles?

592
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,447
Opportunity comes to those
who are prepared.

593
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:18,992
As long as you're passionate
about playing diverse roles,

594
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,953
that opportunity will definitely come.

595
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,415
Hyeon-jun.

596
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,045
When did you get here?

597
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,589
Just now. Who were you talking to?

598
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:33,590
It's me, Su-ji.

599
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:37,970
Did you know that Su-ji is quite humorous?

600
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:39,429
You want to see?

601
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,100
Hey, Sui-ji. Tell me a funny story.

602
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,519
You can't help but laugh at this.

603
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,814
When do you weigh the most?

604
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,901
When you're "full of yourself."

605
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,741
When you're full of yourself!

606
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,330
She said "when you're full of yourself"!

607
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,623
That's funny.

608
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,753
Lim Hyeon-jun and Jin Su-a
have the same passport holders!

609
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,005
Oh, you're right!

610
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:13,922
The colors are different,

611
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,799
but they have
the same brand and model bracelet.

612
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,219
And they did
an outdoor clothing commercial.

613
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,515
Hey, this is a sure thing!

614
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,975
Yes, we did it!

615
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,687
-But there's a problem.
-A problem?

616
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,981
These photos are from three years ago.

617
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,691
Three years ago? What about now?

618
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,902
How would I know? They probably broke up.

619
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,194
Hey!

620
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,156
LIM HYEON-JUN & JIN SU-A?

621
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,824
No, that's not it.

622
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,120
I can't get in touch
with Mr. Lim at the moment.

623
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,248
Let me confirm with him first and…

624
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:49,291
Yes, exactly.

625
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,502
Yes, Mr. Park. Okay, take care.

626
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:55,339
This reporter is a damn lunatic!

627
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,382
Unbelievable.

628
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,926
This is the result

629
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:02,095
of teaching that reporter a lesson,
don't you think?

630
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,097
Come on, everyone in Korea knows

631
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:07,100
that we dated for just a month
three years ago!

632
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,769
Why write an article like this now?

633
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,356
What did Su-a say?

634
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,942
What do you think?
She's just as pissed as you.

635
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,069
What should we do?
Deny that you're dating?

636
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,987
Wait, we should just say you two broke up.

637
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,447
But three years ago?

638
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,532
LIM HYEON-JUN & JIN SU-A
BUDDING ROMANCE OR JUST A COINCIDENCE?

639
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,619
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin.

640
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,788
Oh, man.

641
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:31,249
In all my life, never did I think
I'd memorize a reporter's name.

642
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,469
Why is my name on an article
that I didn't even write?

643
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,263
It was written based on your research,
so that's why your name is on it.

644
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,974
I thought you suspected they were dating.

645
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,059
I said I had suspicions.
I never said they were.

646
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,727
You can't release an article
without checking!

647
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,145
Be quiet.

648
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:53,897
This hasn't been fact-checked.

649
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,357
This was from three years ago,

650
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,150
and I said I didn't think
they were still dating.

651
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:00,445
Then release an article
saying they already broke up.

652
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,405
How does that work?

653
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,948
Why are you acting dumb?

654
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,908
Don't you know how things work here?

655
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,955
METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

He is an honorary police officer

658
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,840
who made a gracious donation to provide
economic aid to victims of crime.

659
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,884
Please welcome
Actor Lim Hyeon-jun to the podium.

660
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:47,367
I'd like to request the understanding
of the reporters gathered here today.

661
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,453
Unfortunately, Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong

662
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:53,415
will not be allowed
to take part in this interview.

663
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,877
I'm sorry, but we must ask
the reporter to leave.

664
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,630
Who is Wi Jeong-sin?

665
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,299
Who is that?

666
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,123
We kindly ask everyone to remain quiet.

667
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,780
Mr. Lim, look this way for the camera!

668
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,407
-Mr. Lim, give us a big smile!
-Can you make a heart with your hands?

669
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:11,868
PRESS

670
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,870
You got kicked out?
What do you mean, what should you do?

671
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:15,872
Are you really asking me that?

672
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,169
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

673

Wi Jeong-sin. I'll remember your name.

687
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,378
You'd better delete those articles.

688
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,841
-Reporters like you suck.
-Quit your job, Wi Jeong-sin.

689
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,551
Delete, delete, delete.

690
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,178

-I'm sorry.
-Nice job.

694
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,735

"Hyeon-jun suspected of abuse of power"
is trending right now!

699
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,205
-What?
-What in the world

700
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,624
gave you the idea
to publicly humiliate a reporter?

701
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,501
-That reporter--
-She's going to be all over you now!

702
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,670
Oh, who cares?

703
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,923
I've done a lot of good over the years.

704
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,092
The public is on my side,
and so are the reporters.

705
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,469
Drops of water make a mighty ocean.

706
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,888
Your public image will take a hit
if these articles pile up.

707
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,307
You think that's the right idiom
for this situation?

708
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,892
Whatever.

709
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,436
This is much worse than a romance scandal.

710
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,687
Why are you blaming me?

711
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,899
That lunatic is the one
who stirred up trouble!

712
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:09,277
Come on, don't be like that!

713
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:10,779
Make up with that reporter, bro.

714
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,031
I'll set up a meeting today.

715
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,574
Who says I have to?

716
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:17,369
Look, another article just got posted.

717
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,371
Why is this speeding up?
What are you doing?

718
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,539
Hey, bro, wait a minute!

719
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:22,582
Bro!

720
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,252
CHUNGHYO HALL

721
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,429
Why are you grunting?

722
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,487
I'm very sorry about what happened.

723
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:03,206
Ms. Wi, there's no apology big enough
to undo the disrespect

724
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,293
we showed you
during that public appearance.

725
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,378
Ms. Wi is at fault too.

726
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,049
She shouldn't have written about
an alleged dating rumor.

727
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:14,467
It was my mistake as desk chief.

728
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:17,637
Goodness, not at all!

729
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,057
-We look forward to working with you.
-Likewise.

730
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:23,810
We look forward to receiving
more exclusives from you.

731
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:27,314
Is there even any doubt?
Of course, we will!

732
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,234
Enough of this.

733
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,902
Please accept a drink.

734
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:33,820
Here.

735
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:38,908
What are you doing?

736
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:40,618
What's the matter with you?

737
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:46,041
I'm here to receive an apology,
not to give one.

738
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,500
Why are you apologizing on my behalf?

739
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:50,628
-I'm not sorry at all.
-What are you doing?

740
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:52,130
We're not pushovers.

741
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,257
She screwed us over
for not doing the interview.

742
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:55,925
So why the hell are you apologizing?

743
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,929
Don't you agree?
Do you intend to apologize?

744
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:03,808
Of course,

745
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,061
I don't intend to apologize.

746
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,314
I don't even want an apology anymore.

747
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,399
It's ridiculous to cater to every tantrum

748
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:12,901
of a middle-aged man acting like a diva!

749
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:18,448
Then there's no reason to stay here.

750
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,492
I feel the same way too!

751
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,095
I thought you'd come to your senses,
but I guess not.

752
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,138
I've never lost my senses.

753
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,807
After all, Jeong-sin
literally means "senses."

754
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,724
That's not funny.

755
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,645
Is this the work you'll be doing?

756
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:56,361
Imagine this is the political desk.

757
00:44:57,404 --> 00:45:00,407
Were you this sloppy
and emotional over there too?

758
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:04,160
Would you have interviewed assemblymen
without knowing a thing about them?

759
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:08,039
Or would you have run your mouth
and made them your mortal enemies?

760
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,126
Do you want to bury Lim Hyeon-jun?

761
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,295
Fine. Go ahead and bury him.

762
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,798
But at least get to know

763
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,135
who it is you're burying.

764
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,887
That's how you bury him for good.

765
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,017
Do well.

766
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,907
Imagine this is the political desk.

767
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,870
Were you this sloppy
and emotional over there too?

768
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:50,415
Ms. Wi.

769
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,000
You haven't watched the drama.

770
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,711
Since you're not clear on the content,
I guess the interview

771
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,921
will have to end.

772
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,467
But at least get to know

773
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,469
who it is you're burying.

774
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:21,029
Groveling at my feet
wouldn't have been enough!

775
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,363
What did she call me again?

776
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,908
A middle-aged man acting like a diva?

777
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,659
Unbelievable.

778
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,036
But you are a middle-aged man.

779
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,330
Nothing she said was wrong.

780
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,458
Hey, it's the director!

781
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:35,460
Hello, sir!

782
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,922
Director Kim Cheol-ho, how are you?

783
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:44,093
Goodness, I've just been
waiting by the phone, hoping you'd call.

784
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,721
Excuse me? Saturday?

785
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,599
Saturday sounds great!

786
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:52,101
Yes, sir!

787
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:55,230
I'll make a reservation
and get back to you, then.

788
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,233
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

789
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,448
Are you home, Jeong-sin?

790
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,408
Jeez, why is it raining so hard?

791
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,747
Jeez, get cleaned up before you sit down!

792
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,707
No, I'm too hungry.

793
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,544
Why didn't you take a taxi
or buy an umbrella at a convenience store?

794
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:20,004
You don't earn a thing,
but you're quick to tell me to spend mine.

795
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:23,007
Don't you have a guy you can call
to bring you an umbrella?

796
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:23,925
No.

797
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,928
Do you know what's written on your face?

798
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,763
-What?
-"I am solo."

799
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,057
Quoi que l'on dise, on restera solo

800
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,768
Quoi que l'on fasse, on restera solo
Solo, solo

801
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,229
Hey, solo, have some kimchi stew.

802
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:42,819
You're kind of a combination
of Gwang-su and Yeong-suk,

803
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:43,987
so let's call you Gwang-suk.

804
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:49,409
Jeong-sin, are you SSB?
Single Since Birth?

805
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,911
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

806
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:53,580
Plenty.

807
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,832
It's not something to be proud of.

808
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,751
A normal person
would feel ashamed and get mad.

809
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,128
There's no shame in that!

810
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,921
You won't make it in the real world
with that mindset!

811
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,047
Not again.

812
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,551
Hey, we have somewhere to go
in the morning.

813
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,595
-Where?
-To pick up a TV.

814
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,431
I knew it.

815
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,766
-How much did you pay for this?
-I got it for free.

816
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,518
Does it even work?

817
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:18,021
Some people just give things away
instead of paying to trash them.

818
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:21,107
I already checked and made sure it worked.

819
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,320
Pass it to me!

820
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,237
Get in there!

821
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,656
-Move up!
-That's it!

822
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,890
Yeah!

823
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,565
Good job!

824
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,112
Jeez, take a hint. The director is pissed.

825
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,199
All right, let's do this!

826
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,283
All right!

827
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,743
Let's go, Director!

828
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,375
Yes!

829
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,377
Nice job!

830
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,170
Cut him off!

831
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,672
Shoot the ball.

832
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,216
Great shot!

833
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,218
Excellent!

834
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,135
I'm on him!

835
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:42,480
Wow, how do you make such brilliant shots?

836
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,358
I recently had ankle surgery,
but it seems fine.

837
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,276
I haven't even gotten the stitches out.

838
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,072
Director, you have such artistic flair,

839
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,699
you even kick the ball with style.

840
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:56,202
It was totally an award-worthy shot!

841
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,162
Shoot like a star!

842
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,623
Academy Award for Best Director shot!

843
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,503
Director, enjoy a cold drink.

844
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,462
WHEN A MAN FALLS IN LOVE

845
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,297
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

846
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:11,509
Thank you so much, Director.

847
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,469
I'm sure a ton of actors

848
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,930
-lined up for this.
-No, not at all.

849
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:19,892
I've felt bad because Hyeon-jun
has a lot of hidden potential,

850
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:23,479
but he was pigeonholed
as a detective for far too long.

851
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,817
This project is a melodrama.

852
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,235
Changing your public image is good,

853
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:32,113
but as a viewer, I look forward to seeing

854
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,031
a different side
to Lim Hyeon-jun's acting.

855
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,619
Sir,

856
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,289
I've been dying to do just that.

857
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:46,294
I am truly grateful
that you reached out to me.

858
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,089
The role of Sang-do
is a pretty good challenge, right?

859
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,258
Sang-do?

860
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,302
You mean, An Sang-do?

861
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,428
Yes, An Sang-do.

862
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,638
But An Sang-do is a thug.

863
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,016
That's right. A thug.

864
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,352
You've played a detective, but not a thug.

865
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:08,232
Hold on.
All that aside, Sang-do is the third…

866
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,568
-The fourth thug?
-The fifth.

867
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,903
The fifth thug?

868
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,946
Yes, that's right.

869
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:18,618
But he interacts with the lead a lot,
so he gets plenty of screen time.

870
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:23,164
Wait, so did you call me here
to cast me as the fourth thug?

871
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:24,624
I said the fifth thug.

872
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,128
I guess there was a misunderstanding.

873
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:33,883
Kang Pil-gu has left
such a strong impression

874
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,761
that it doesn't match
the main character's artist image.

875
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,971
But sir, you just said you felt bad for me

876
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:43,100
because I've been pigeonholed
as a detective for so long.

877
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:44,352
That's why a thug is perfect.

878
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,438
A rough and righteous thug
with a different vibe.

879
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:51,776
What with the fan meeting behavior issue

880
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:55,029
-and the sushi photo incident--
-But that was--

881
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,031
Even ignoring that,
there's still the dating rumor.

882
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,325
In any case, this project

883
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:02,703
is a melodrama about a man
falling desperately in love

884
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,706
with a woman who's losing her sight,
so an emotional connection is impossible.

885
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,999
A thug is perfect for you.

886
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,766
This looks so good.

887
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,311
Let's see here.

888
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:31,899
LIM HYEON-JUN AS KANG PIL-GU

889
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,568
SKIP INTRO

890
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,778
This had better be good.

891
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,033
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU
EPISODE 1

892
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,683
Time to take out the trash.

893
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:06,934
Let's go!

894
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,312
Not half bad.

895
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,524
-Su-ji, I feel awful today!
-Yes?

896
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,652
What am I supposed to do
at times like this?

897
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:19,155
It sounds like you had a rough day.
What happened?

898
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,908
I still feel twisted up inside.

899
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,579
Is there anything I can do for this?

900
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,373
Maybe if you wash your hands in cold water
and brush your teeth,

901
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,292
you'll feel a bit better.

902
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:35,254
Really?

903
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:48,684
Damn it!

904
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,407
No, don't get hurt.

905
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:07,328
That's it! Good job!

906
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,957
Yeah!

907
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,835
Look behind you. Be careful!

908
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,549
Nice work.

909
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,428
They say you can't fix people.

910
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,889
"They say you can't fix people."

911
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:28,474
But I do.

912
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:29,934
"But I do."

913
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,794
What in the world gave you the idea
to publicly humiliate a reporter?

914
00:54:56,877 --> 00:55:00,756
She's going to be all over you now!

915
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,885
What with the fan meeting behavior issue

916
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:08,222
and the sushi photo incident
on National Liberation Day,

917
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,850
there's still the dating rumor.

918
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,435
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

919
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:20,985
That's crazy.

920
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,279
That's it.

921
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:28,993
Holy shit, that was crazy.

922
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,712
He's so amazing.

923
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:42,673
Wi Jeong-sin!

924
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,091
You crazy…

925
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:16,749
Are you scared?

926
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,089
I'll protect you.

927
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:26,300
Let's go.

928
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,309
What the heck?

929
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,107
Come out here.

930
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:43,943
What in the world?

931
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:47,238
-Where is he?
-Kang Pil-gu!

932
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,740
Kang Pil-gu, where are you?

933
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:52,785
You guys!

934
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,706
He's so cool.

935
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,597
Your mom's waiting for you.

936
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,352
Let's go.

937
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,792
I'll just watch a bit more.

938
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:43,544
Hey, stop!

939
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,089
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 4

940
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:57,516
Let go of me!

941
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,273
That's it.

942
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:12,656
Jae-hyeon! Damn it!

943
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,117
Hey, wake up! Jae-hyeon!

944
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:18,162
Jae-hyeon!

945
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:52,655
Detective Kang Pil-gu played a key role
solving major crimes, catching criminals,

946
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:56,158
and tracking down the killer
behind the recent serial murder case.

947
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:58,661
Wi Jeong-sin, wake up!

948
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,162
In recognition of his achievements,

949
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:03,082
Detective Kang Pil-gu is hereby promoted
to Chief Inspector.

950
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,589
You've done well.

951
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:13,676
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 4

952
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,055
They say you can't fix people.

953
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,479
But I do.

954
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:40,035
I'll protect you.

Kang Pil-gu?

957
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,642
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin?

958
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,897
May I have a moment of your time?

959
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:32,166
I think I messed with
the wrong crazy lady.

960
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,376
Keep going if you want to find out.

961
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,544
Hyeon-jun!

962
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:37,296
Lim Hyeon-jun attempted suicide?

963
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,589
That's why I need you.

964
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,257
I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

965
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,967
Man, this hurts.

966
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:44,052
Goodness, what brings you here?

967
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:45,888
Are you two dating again?

968
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:49,683
I just didn't want you
to get photographed by reporters.

969
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,893
Who's in there?

970
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:51,977
Open…

971
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:55,939
You're unbelievable.
