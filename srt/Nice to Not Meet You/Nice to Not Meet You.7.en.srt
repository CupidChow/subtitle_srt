1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,471
I actually look a lot like Lim Hyeon-jun.

2
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,889
-Really?
-Yes, totally.

3
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,308
-Want to check for yourself?
-If you schedule a transaction on Onion,

4
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,268
you can talk on the app for 30 minutes.

5
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,187
I guess I'll find out.

6
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,271
How about this Friday?

7
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,314
At 10:30 p.m.

8
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,507
Ms. Wi.

9
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,635
Ms. Wi, wake up.

10
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:33,677
Ms. Wi, are you okay?

11
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,597
If it's too much, do you want to go home?

12
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,818
I deliberately released that article,
you know.

13
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,613
Why?

14
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,615
My mother never did anything wrong to you.

15
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,033
-So will you fire me?
-Should I?

16
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,702
If you can't stand me, go ahead.
What's stopping you?

17
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,622
Because you mean nothing to me anymore.

18
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,375
You're being overly friendly
to Wi Jeong-sin.

19
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,755
When did you become so dense?

20
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,675
There's only one reason
a man is friendly to a woman,

21
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,135
isn't there?

22
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,723
Can I go now?

23
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,979
If you're putting on a show for me,
I've seen enough.

24
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,319
Don't tell me you're jealous.

25
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,212
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

26
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,964
Cut me some slack.

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,425
You know what today is.

28
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,719
Consider that your birthday gift to me.

29
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:13,152
I have called this press conference

30
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,613
to address the dating rumors
involving a female doctor.

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,534
The person identified as my partner
in an exclusive report

32
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,703
is actually my biological daughter.

33
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,293
The taxi's here.

34
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,588
Here we go. Watch your head.

35
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,468
I live in the same direction as Ms. Wi,
so I can drop her off on my way.

36
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,053
Okay. I'll text you her address.

37
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,639
-All right. Have a good night.
-Goodbye!

38
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,310
-Come on.
-No, I can't.

39
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,813
I should head home now.

40
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:51,982
You're drunk. Go home.

41
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,820
Okay, here we go.

42
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:10,209
Regarding Sports Eunseong,
the media outlet behind the article,

43
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,961
and Reporter Wi Jeong-sin,

44
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,464
I will be suing them for defamation.

45
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,036
MELOMASTER (ONION FRIEND)

46
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,920
Are you okay?

47
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,463
Are you…

48
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,594
MELOMASTER (ONION FRIEND)

49
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,181
You have a phone call.

50
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:12,980
Hello?

51
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,274
SOULISHERE (ONION FRIEND)

52
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,400
Hello?

53
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,694
Is anyone there?

54
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,906
Hello?

55
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:31,707
Who was that?

56
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,708
Was that her boyfriend?

57
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,713
Is she married?

58
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,805
Somebody from work is calling.

59
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,647
This is Reporter Wi Jeong-sin's phone.

60
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,275
Ms. Wi isn't quite…

61
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,822
Wait, that's…

62
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,328
Hello, this is Wi Jeong-sin speaking.

63
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,456
Hey, it's total chaos at work.
You need to get here now.

64
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,458
Huh? What did you say?

65
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,129
Excuse me, sir.

66
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,881
Could you drop me off at Sports Eunseong?

67
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:21,799
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,759
Why?

69
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,385
What's the matter?

70
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,223
I think I'm needed back in the office.

71
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,017
But why are you here?

72
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,854
A post on an online forum
has sparked a heated debate

73
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,607
after a man claimed to be
unfairly accused of an affair.

74
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,777
The man claims he chatted online
with a woman he met on social media

75
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,238
without knowing she was married.

76
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,156
When the husband found out,

77
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,534
he filed a lawsuit against the man
for having an affair with his wife.

78
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,829
The man insists he never had
any physical contact with the woman,

79
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,332
-and maintains his innocence.
-I swear I'm innocent. Me, an adulterer?

80
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,793
I can't believe I'm getting sued for this.

81
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,504
There was absolutely no physical contact.

82
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,548
We've never even spoken on the phone.

83
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,258
This is so unfair!

84
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,096
-Jeez.
-We have breaking news in entertainment.

85
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,599
Actor Yoon Jung-ho held
an emergency press conference tonight

86
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,937
to issue a statement on dating rumors
involving a female doctor in her 40s,

87
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,398
which is drawing much attention
from the public.

88
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,108
Let's take a look at the press conference.

89
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,526
She's not my romantic partner.

90
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,611
REVEALED TO BE HIS DAUGHTER,
NOT A ROMANTIC PARTNER

91
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,655
She's my biological daughter.

92
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,867
-Oh, gosh.
-She was born from an extramarital affair

93
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,451
during my second marriage.

94
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,704
I fell short of what's expected
from a public figure,

95
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,249
and I apologize
for keeping her hidden for so long.

96
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,084
EPISODE 7

97
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,256
What happened?

98
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,176
She's his daughter, not his lover.

99
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,844
It's like a soap opera.

100
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:49,887
Wi Jeong-sin.

101
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:58,520
Do you still consider yourself
the Korean Journalist of the Year winner?

102
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,480
-Excuse me?
-Take care of this yourself.

103
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,149
It's too humiliating for the company,

104
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,068
so do whatever it takes,
whether you beg or blackmail him.

105
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,070
He sent the lawsuit by express courier.

106
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,573
If he doesn't drop the lawsuit,
don't even think of coming in.

107
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,709
COMPLAINT

108
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,265
Man, I'm exhausted.

109
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,810
Oh, is my little boy up?

110
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,563
Mommy had to return to the office
because something came up.

111
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,817
I'll be home soon,
so you go back to sleep, okay?

112
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,277
I love you, my sweet boy.

113
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,072
Give Mommy a kiss.

114
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,295
Oh, excuse me.

115
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,676
Have you sobered up?

116
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,760
Yes.

117
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,845
Does the chief have a son?

118
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,431
You didn't know?
She's divorced and has a kid.

119
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,349
She is?

120
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,353
But nobody knows who the father is.

121
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:22,938
It's a mystery.

122
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,485
-She's a troll posing as a reporter.
-Who knew I'd memorize a reporter's name?

123
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,612
Jeez, what a mess.

124
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,407
The true problem with the media
is the reporters.

125
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,741
This is insane.

126
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,577
If she deserved
the Korean Journalist of the Year award,

127
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,079
I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.

128
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,665
Jeez, I knew this would happen.

129
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,792
She flat-out acted like the paparazzi,

130
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,503
-so what's she going to do now?
-My uncle works at Eunseongilbo

131
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,505
-and says she was a political reporter.
-Where are all the trolls

132
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,048
who posted "senile" hate comments?

133
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,509
Seriously.

134
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,389
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

135
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:58,807
Wait.

136
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,059
What does this even have to do with me?

137
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,519
She can take care of herself.

138
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,901
But can she?

139
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,826
IS WI JEONG-SIN EVEN A REAL REPORTER?

140
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:21,330
You got about 5,000 hate comments
on UTube and on social media.

141
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,041
I guess what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

142
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,001
Do you see a resemblance?

143
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,212
Not really. Why?

144
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,882
-Is their relationship a lie?
-It's possible.

145
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,134
Maybe he's in a situation
where he needs to avoid scandals.

146
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
Like what?

147
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,514
The National Assembly
candidate selection is coming up.

148
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,143
They say Yoon Jung-ho secured
the ruling party's nod for Mucheon City.

149
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,729
He also openly talked about
wanting to go into politics.

150
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,649
During last year's presidential election,
he often showed up at campaign events.

151
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,027
Look at you.

152
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,571
That sounds plausible.

153
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,534
Who is it?

154
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,870
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

155
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,789
Is Mr. Yoon Jung-ho at home?

156
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,733
I can't say I'm happy to see you.

157
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,319
I only let you in
because you waited all night.

158
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,404
Thank you, sir.

159
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:39,366
Once I make a decision,
I follow through, no matter what.

160
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,160
So if you're here to beg me
to drop the lawsuit,

161
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,662
you can be on your way.

162
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,914
-I'm not here to beg.
-What?

163
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,833
I'm here to let you know

164
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,585
-that if you don't drop the lawsuit,
-What?

165
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,255
you'll find yourself
in a very uncomfortable

166
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,340
and embarrassing situation
for a long time.

167
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,633
What did you say?

168
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,594
Why you disrespectful…

169
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:04,391
Hey, is that all you have to say?

170
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,559
Yes, it is.

171
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,146
That little…

172
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,814
Hey!

173
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,821
More! Keep the pressure on!

174
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,948
That's it! You're doing great.

175
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,032
Move in again.

176
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,453
Keep your guard up!

177
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,621
Block him! Look for an opening!

178
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,249
Wait for your shot! Good!

179
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,169
Keep your guard up.

180
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,341
-Are you okay?
-Let's take a break.

181
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,557
SOULISHERE

182
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,934
Hello? Is anyone there?

183
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,651
Onion!

184
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,204
Some guy answered your phone last night.

185
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,374
-Is everything okay?
-Oh, man.

186
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,792
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,712
I drank too much at the team dinner
and fell asleep in the taxi.

188
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,882
My boss was with me,
and I think he answered my phone.

189
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,343
Right, of course.

190
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,346
For a second there,

191
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:28,099
I thought it was
your husband or boyfriend.

192
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,525
AN APPOINTMENT HAS BEEN BOOKED
"VIEW APPOINTMENT"

193
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,737
"An appointment has been booked"?

194
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,700
SOULISHERE (ONION FRIEND)

195
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,410
Wait, this…

196
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:52,749
What do I…

197
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,675
Hello?

198
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,053
I'm not married.

199
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,182
Right.

200
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,850
I guess that's a relief, then.

201
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,066
Anyway, it sounds like you're close

202
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,151
with your male boss.

203
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,780
Well, we're not close.

204
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,324
We only shared a taxi since we were
headed in the same direction.

205
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,536
Oh, I see.

206
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,663
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

207
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,582
Also,

208
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,792
thank you…

209
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,752
for calling.

210
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:44,551
Gosh.

211
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,637
It's nice to hear your voice.

212
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,766
I feel the same.

213
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,602
By the way,

214
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,688
you really do sound
exactly like Lim Hyeon-jun.

215
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,273
See, I told you!

216
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,400
I told you I sound exactly like him.

217
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,237
Can you say a line from Kang Pil-gu?

218
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,155
Sorry?

219
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,116
Oh, sure.

220
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,706
"They say you can't fix people."

221
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,125
"But I do."

222
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,632
Wow, how are you so good at impressions?

223
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,050
Impressions…

224
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,304
My gosh, you sounded just like him.

225
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,514
Hey, come and eat.

226
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,269
I have to get ready for work,
so I need to hang up.

227
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,520
Oh, I see.

228
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,773
Then,

229
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,442
we'll talk soon.

230
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,401
Right.

231
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,569
Okay.

232
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,031
What the heck?

233
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,161
Jeez.

234
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,414
What am I doing?

235
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,875
Gosh.

236
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,468
Let's go again. Nice.

237
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,637
Be precise. That's it!

238
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,265
Nice!

239
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,476
Yes, keep going!

240
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,231
One more time!

241
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,483
That's it! Good job!

242
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,365
Do we need to check if he's on something?

243
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,409
Seriously, what's gotten into him?

244
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,998
How long will you keep that up?

245
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,629
Talk to me.

246
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,840
What is it?

247
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,970
I'm asking nicely.
Don't make me beat it out of you.

248
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,013
I'm counting to three.

249
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,516
-One, two, three!
-The audition.

250
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,226
I failed the audition.

251
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,936
What?

252
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,104
Hey, come on.

253
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,733
It's not the first time
you failed an audition.

254
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,943
This is all your fault!

255
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,029
Even I would flunk
the brother of someone I can't stand.

256
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,949
What are you talking about?

257
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,784
At the audition,

258
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,245
my bro Kang Pil-gu himself failed me.

259
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,039
He gave me an earful too,
like he had a lot bottled up inside.

260
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,041
I get it now.

261
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,294
Are you here for revenge?

262
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,756
Now do you understand how awful it feels
when your family gets dragged?

263
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,218
Damn it.

264
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,889
Is Ms. Wi coming in today?

265
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,433
I assume she will.
She needs to clear out her desk.

266
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,269
Jeez, and we already gave her
a farewell party.

267
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,105
Hello.

268
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,690
-You're here.
-Hi.

269
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,782
Okay, we've got a lot of interviews today.

270
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,033
Right.

271
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,785
Hello, sir.

272
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,704
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Lee.

273
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,795
He's so cool.

274
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,592
I think something's going on
between Mr. Lee and our chief.

275
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,510
Seriously?

276
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,721
The night of Jeong-sin's farewell party,

277
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,224
I was coming out of the restroom
and saw them kissing!

278
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,601
-Holy cow.
-Are you serious?

279
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,560
Yes!

280
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,146
Maybe you saw it wrong.

281
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,565
Right, what if you saw it wrong?

282
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,109
Hey, I have 20/20 vision.

283
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,905
Wow, Mr. Lee's such a man.

284
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:34,864
Nope.

285
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,950
The chief kissed him first.

286
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,868
-What?
-No way.

287
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,331
Here you are.

288
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,416
The chief editor is looking for you.

289
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,878
My transfer's been canceled?

290
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,298
Did you really think the political desk
would welcome you back after this fiasco?

291
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,261
Take a few days off
and come back when things cool down.

292
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,304
But his claim hasn't even been verified.

293
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,682
He's talking about genetic testing,
but it can't be legally enforced!

294
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,892
It's obvious he'll keep putting it off
until it never happens!

295
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,395
Also, he got the party nomination
and might run in the by-election--

296
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,646
Here.

297
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:07,689
Read it.

298
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,154
GENETIC TEST REPORT

299
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,117
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY: 99.999%

300
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,661
I have to issue a correction?

301
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,122
Do you expect me to issue a correction
for an article you wrote?

302
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,457
We have to issue a correction first

303
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,834
before he drops the lawsuit.

304
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:43,933
Ms. Wi.

305
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:48,938
Have you eaten yet?

306
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,316
-No.
-Then let's go eat.

307
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,068
Do I look like the starving type?

308
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,739
You keep vanishing
every time I invite you to eat.

309
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,617
Promise that you'll eat with me today.

310
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,497
Co-produce Kang Pil-gu?

311
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,916
You're going into producing, Mr. Hwang?

312
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,377
Yes, well…

313
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,757
I thought I'd start out with this project.

314
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,470
I guess it's trendy for agencies
to get into production.

315
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,724
Well, actors don't just want to sit around
and wait for offers to come in.

316
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,603
They feel an urge to make something
on their own every now and then.

317
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,148
This isn't a decision
I can make on my own.

318
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,192
I'll talk it over with my company.

319
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,318
Right.

320
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,197
And about Director Bak…

321
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,782
-Director Bak Byeong-gi?
-Yes.

322
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,618
Gosh…

323
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,787
Go ahead and say it.

324
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,288
-Well…
-Go ahead.

325
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,374
You see, Director Bak used to be

326
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:54,295
a very promising young director,

327
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,923
but he hasn't directed in so long…

328
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,051
-That's not true.
-That's an excellent point.

329
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,931
Director Bak is the genius type, so it…

330
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,225
So unlike the previous seasons,

331
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,436
it's possible this season
could turn out to be very…

332
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,522
Bak Byeong-gi is a total lunatic.

333
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,190
So we make one wrong move,

334
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,068
and it might turn out downright bizarre.

335
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,194
Is that okay with you?

336
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,406
There's such a big difference in length
between movies and dramas,

337
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,533
it could take him time to adjust to it.

338
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,953
He films all day and night
in the name of art,

339
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,122
so he'll go over
the time and budget limit.

340
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:33,167
You'll need to do a really good job
putting together a key crew.

341
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,712
The second unit director, gaffer,
director of photography, music director…

342
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,214
I'm going to assign them myself.

343
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,132
End of discussion.

344
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,177
I mean, I still trust he'll do a good job,

345
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,431
but I'm a little concerned.

346
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,437
Come on, bro.

347
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,940
Is it really our place
to assign the key crew?

348
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,901
I'm not assigning anyone.
I'm merely suggesting.

349
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,194
Oh, so you're suggesting.

350
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,738
You watched The Days of Romance.

351
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,324
Cinematographer Hwang Ji-hyeok
is amazing at shooting male actors.

352
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,784
That was a melodrama.

353
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,369
This is a detective action series.

354
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,622
It's not important
that your face looks soft and dreamy.

355
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,500
It's good, right?

356
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,211
What is it?

357
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,214
It's important to me.

358
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,632
I'm determined to do a melodrama next.

359
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,801
Fine. How about a round
at a golf simulator?

360
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,637
I have an appointment with Byeong-gi.

361
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,599
Why are you meeting with him?

362
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,310
Why? Tell me.

363
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:33,728
You must be upset

364
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,189
about not returning to the political desk.

365
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,234
I suppose so.

366
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:43,654
The public reacted so badly
to the Yoon Jung-ho article

367
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,865
that I couldn't do anything about it.

368
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,495
But I have to say,

369
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,163
I can't help feeling excited.

370
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,333
I get to keep seeing you like this

371
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,709
since you're not returning
to the political desk.

00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,193
Are you a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun?

375
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,654
No.

376
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,699
Really? But you were staring at him.

377
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,952
And at the baseball stadium too.

378
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,164
Oh, did I? I don't remember.

379
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,584
Hey, slow down.

380
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,213
This is good.

381
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,214
Yes, it is.

382
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,511
When I said I felt excited earlier,

383
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,637
you know I was joking, right?

384
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,016
Seeing you having to stick around
because of the incident

385
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,519
doesn't make me feel good.

386
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:58,980
Because of me?

387
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:00,815
Yes.

388
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,656
Do you always worry about
any woman you see?

389
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,202
Well, I've always had good manners,

390
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,288
but I'm not that easy.

391
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,624
Are you aware that you confuse people?

392
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,295
I hear something's going on
between you and our chief.

393
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,173
So let's not give anyone the wrong idea.

394
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,845
I was in a relationship with her
a long time ago.

395
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,015
I don't know what you heard,

396
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,267
but we're not together now.

397
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,271
Are you feeling jealous?

398
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,108
It's not like that.

BAK BYEONG-GI

00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,475
-Come in.
-Thanks.

401
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,854
This is nice.

402
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,232
When did you move to this studio?

403
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,193
I needed a bigger place
because I have so many books.

404
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,319
Would you like a beverage?

405
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,737
-No.
-All right.

406
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,240
Where's your assistant?
Why are you working alone?

407
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,450
Everyone works from home these days.

408
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,495
How much have you written so far?

409
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,290
I sent in episodes five and six last week,
and now I'm writing seven and eight.

410
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,920
Once we have the supporting cast and crew,
we'll need to start filming right away.

411
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,213
Will that be enough?

412
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,757
You won't have time to write
because of the shoot preparations.

413
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,259
I'll have to make it happen.

414
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,763
If you're having difficulty,

415
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,140
how about getting a co-writer?

416
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,058
A co-writer?

417
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,017
Yeah.

418
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,854
I can introduce you to someone
who's good at writing romantic lines.

419
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,608
I've already mapped out the ending,
so it won't be hard to write the script.

420
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:08,526
Don't worry about it.

421
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:14,490
Oh, yeah?

422
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,909
Well…

423
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,161
I guess that's a relief.

424
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,498
By the way,

425
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,377
the premise of Kang Pil-gu
becoming a corrupt detective…

426
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,838
Isn't that rather cliché?

427
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:33,801
He takes part in a crime
to save his late colleague's sister.

428
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:34,927
Do you not like it?

429
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:39,015
You need to add something extra in there.

430
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,224
Something extra?

431
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:47,189
During the rescue sequence
of his colleague's kidnapped sister,

432
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,691
how about…

433
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:49,692
Mi-yeong!

434
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,324
Mi-yeong.

435
00:26:58,993 --> 00:26:59,827
Mi-yeong.

436
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:07,710
Cut!

437
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,712
Bad take.

438
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,505
Why?

439
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,718
Is it a bit much?

440
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,018
Out of the blue like that?

441
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,562
Why would they French kiss
when they don't know each other?

442
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,689
She's his colleague's sister,
and they're meeting for the first time.

443
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,691
Then just set up a backstory.

444
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:34,570
Maybe they were childhood friends,
or maybe Pil-gu saved her from drowning.

445
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,780
There are a ton of ideas.

446
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:36,989
But why is that necessary?

447
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,241
The viewers want to see Kang Pil-gu
in a romantic role.

448
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,538
You refuse all romantic scenes
with the female lead,

449
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:46,957
but it's fine with a minor character?
That makes no sense.

450
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,753
A writer's job is to
make sense of such things.

451
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,171
Are you freaking serious?

452
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,715
Did you just swear at me?

453
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,052
I almost did, but no.

454
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,640
I'll give it some thought.

455
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,018
I'll think about how to add

456
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,687
some romantic lines.

457
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,898
Good.

458
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,817
You're a good writer, Mr. Bak.

459
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,985
Give it your best shot, all right?

460
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,072
-So, shall we go out and eat now?
-No, thank you.

461
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,409
I have way too much to do.

462
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:22,952
Enjoy your meal.

-This is Wi Jeong-sin speaking.
-It's me, Yoon Jung-ho.

469
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:23,596
Perhaps you thought I'd drop the lawsuit
if you issued a correction,

470
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,097
but I have no intention of doing so.

471

This is Wi Jeong-sin speaking.

472

I'd like to see you today.

473
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,634
And who are you?

474
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,304
At least identify yourself first
if you're the one who called!

475
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,310
It's me, Lim Hyeon-jun.

476
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:16,565
I thought for a second
that you had saved my number.

477
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,444
But is that any reason
to answer a call like that?

478
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,281
Anyway, I'm texting you an address.

479
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,491
I'll see you there.

480
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,370
Jeez.

481
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:43,759
Is this his house?

482
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:13,956
Why did you ask me here?

483
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,208
To show off my house.

484
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,127
It's nice, isn't it?

485
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:19,753
Yes, it is.

486
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,799
Jeez, you don't even understand a joke.

487
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,510
It'll only cause a scandal
if people see us together in public.

488
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:31,849
So, what's this about?

489
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,059
You said I was like bad luck to you,
so I didn't expect to see you again.

490
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,978
I never said you were bad luck.

491
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,564
I said my life becomes a mess.

492
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,107
That's even worse.

493
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,121
So, about that former baseball player

494
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,373
or media company president, or whatever.

495
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:57,791
Are you two close?

496
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,252
He's just my boss.

497
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,380
Is there something
you want to know about him?

498
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,592
Anyway,

499
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,179
I asked you here
because I felt a bit of responsibility.

500
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,890
I saw you issued a correction
about the Yoon Jung-ho article.

501
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,308
Did he say he'd drop the lawsuit?

502
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,896
Did you call because you were concerned?

503
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:29,698
I mean, I participated
in that paparazzi mess, so…

504
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,786
You're concerned you'll get humiliated.

505
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,829
Just tell me what your next move is.

506
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,916
-Why?
-Because I feel some responsibility!

507
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,335
Okay, fine.

508
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,004
I'll tell you your next move.

509
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,673
Just start by apologizing.

510
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,342
If you made a mistake,
you should apologize.

511
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:54,807
I can't apologize.

512
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,518
Not to that piece of trash.

513
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,644
Piece of trash?

514
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,022
So you really won't apologize?

515
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,440
I issued a correction

516
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,151
and corrected my mistake as a reporter.

517
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,194
I won't apologize personally.

518
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,114
-Look--
-I'll make sure

519
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,824
that you're not affected by this.

520
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,535
-That's not the point--
-If we're done here,

521
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,286
I'll be on my way.

522
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,664
But…

523
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:25,713
Seriously…

524
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,015
Did you

525
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,393
fail my brother at the audition
because of me?

526
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,147
No, the thing is…

527
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,735
Look, I don't let
petty emotions affect me.

528
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:48,652
-The--
-If he couldn't act,

529
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:49,903
you just had to fail him.

530
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,405
Why did you have to rub salt in his wound?

531
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,322
But that's not--

532
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,825
Actors who go to auditions
are there to land a role,

533
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,744
not to receive guidance.

534
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,412
Exactly, so that's why I--

535
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,496
Goodbye, then.

536
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,423
Oh, boy.

537
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,845
Everything is so messed up.

538
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,945
What in the world is she thinking?

539
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,949
She was bumped from the political desk
to the entertainment desk.

540
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,076
If she leaves the entertainment desk,
then what?

541
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,037
Where can she go?

542
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:04,812
Damn it.

543
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,781
Get in.

544
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,117
Did you come out to give me a ride?

545
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,078
No, I'm heading to the gym.

546
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,746
Your home is on the way, so get in.

547
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,540
You don't even know where I live.

548
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,124
Are you refusing to get in, then?

549
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,436
Stop wiping it down.

550
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,813
It's fine.

551
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,858
You should've just hopped in right away.

552
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,527
Thank you.

553
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,780
I know you're a busy man.
You should've just left.

554
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,034
I knew you wouldn't have taken a taxi
or bought an umbrella.

555
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,619
You would've just gotten soaked.

556
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,123
How do you know?

557
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,127
How do you know I wouldn't take a taxi
or buy an umbrella?

558
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,715
I mean, it's obvious.

559
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:16,925
You just look like the type.

560
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:23,724
So how did you end up becoming a reporter?

561
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,475
Why choose that over other jobs?

562
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,270
It's a long story.

563
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,521
Then make it short.

564
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,527
Well, I had the looks,
but I also had the brains.

565
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:38,113
I guess you could say
I was too perfect to be real.

566
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,408
Gosh, I can't believe
your story begins with you showing off.

567
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,576
Unbelievable.

568
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,411
Go on. Continue.

569
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,247
I was first in my class

570
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:50,083
in elementary school,
middle school, and high school.

571
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,793
But then…

572
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,337
Second place?

573
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,007
I was shocked
because I'd never come in second before.

574
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,718
And I couldn't help but suspect the kid
who suddenly took the top of the class,

575
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,429
when he had never once
made it into the top 30.

576
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,183
So from that day on,
I started keeping an eye on him.

577
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,541
And that's when I knew

578
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,877
how he came out on top.

579
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:34,795
Wi Jeong-sin.

580
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,255
When I told my teacher the truth,

581
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,299
I naturally thought the problem
would be resolved.

582
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,971
Knowing I didn't have parents
and lived alone with my brother,

583
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,222
the school tried to coax me.

584
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,307
The foundation
would pay my college tuition

585
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,308
if I turned a blind eye.

586
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,851
So what did you do?

587
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,687
To be honest, I was tempted when they said

588
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,063
they'd cover all my tuition.

589
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,359
But seeing him shamelessly laugh
after stealing the answer key,

590
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,403
and seeing the others laugh with him,

591
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,697
not even aware
they were harmed by his actions,

592
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,323
made me snap out of it right away.

593
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,701
So I reported it to the media.

594
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,369
Oh, wow!

595
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,204
What was really amazing was

596
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,832
that it was resolved
the moment the coverage began.

597
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,041
The Language Arts teacher got fired,

598
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,460
and that kid was given a zero
and transferred out.

599
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,504
It was a perfect case of karma.

600
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:21,008
I got on the school's bad side
for damaging their reputation,

601
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:24,511
but I got into Hankuk University
fair and square through the CSAT.

602
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,847
That's my story.

603
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,098
Wow.

604
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:31,977
So that's why you became a reporter,
to punish the bad guys.

605
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:35,397
By the way,
why do you keep driving in circles?

606
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:38,734
We've driven across
every major bridge in Seoul.

607
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,570
It's been a while since I've driven.

608
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,530
All the roads look the same.

609
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,365
But you said you knew the way.

610
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:49,036
Your high school story was so interesting

611
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,330
that I wanted to know how it ended,
and I took the long way.

612
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,666
I'll get home before dawn, right?

613
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,625
Before that,

614
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,795
there's somewhere
you need to come with me.

615
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,715
Why should I apologize?

616
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,425
You need to apologize

617
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,886
if you want him to drop the lawsuit!

618
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,263
I'll hand in my resignation
before I apologize!

619
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,181
Resignation?

620
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:12,100
Standing by your principles
requires sacrifice.

621
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,185
Don't be ridiculous.

622
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,479
You're about to be fired
and summoned to court.

623
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,980
Principles, my ass.

624
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:18,899
Are you rich enough
that you don't need a job?

625
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,860
You said you have no parents,
that it's just you and your brother.

626
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,737
I get that. I get it all too well.

627
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,113
I was in the same boat.

628
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,116
Pride doesn't put food on the table.

629
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,285
I don't know much about reporters,

630
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,996
but something like this
would damage anyone's reputation

631
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,123
and make it hard down the line
when you switch jobs!

632
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,459
Forget the political desk,
you'll just get fired!

633
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,627
Even so, I refuse

634
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,295
to apologize to that piece of trash.

635
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,298
Fine.

636
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:47,427
Having an extramarital affair
and fathering a child is wrong.

637
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,055
But that daughter doesn't deserve this!

638
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,598
You don't understand!

639
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,350
That piece of trash…

640
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,603
He's sexually harassed women for years!

641
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,024
-Are you positive?
-Of course, I am!

642
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,275
They told me in person.

643
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,693
You know actor Yoon Jung-ho, right?

644
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,821
He's a mature, charismatic actor
known for his strong acting.

645
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,532
There are rumors going around
that he's dating a psychiatrist

646
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,783
who is 30 years younger than him.

647
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,034
Let's say that's true.

648
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,203
But…

649
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,998
dating a younger woman
isn't exactly a crime.

650
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,667
Are you telling me
to make him look like trash?

651
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,918
It's okay if you do.

652
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,920
Because he really is a piece of trash.

653
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,840
Mr. Yoon, Se-na is here.

654
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,051
Hello, sir.

655
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:31,888
Hi, Se-na.

656
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,766
Can you go over the lines with me?

657
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,184
Yes, sir.

658
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:37,352
Give us some privacy.

659
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,857
-I wasn't the only one.
-Take a seat.

660
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,484
He only went after those
in supporting or minor roles.

661
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,945
The ones who had no power
or courage to stand up to him

662
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,781
and were desperate for their next role.

663
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,371
But you have power now.

664
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,081
It's not too late to step up--

665
00:40:58,665 --> 00:40:59,708
Are you insane?

666
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:03,503
You want me to risk my reputation
to take down a respected senior actor?

667
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,174
Is there anyone else…

668
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:09,926
who can prove this?

669
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,305
What did the other victims say?

670
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:14,764
They all declined, didn't they?

671
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,725
They did.

672
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,644
So if you could find the courage
to speak up--

673
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,062
I don't want to find that kind of courage.

674
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,442
I can't find that kind of courage,

675
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,486
but I don't want to see him on TV anymore.

676
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:32,407
I want to browse channels freely
without feeling uneasy.

677
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,534
The extent of his actions
is too terrible to put into words.

678
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,204
I'll never apologize.

679
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,748
-But…
-I can issue a correction on my article.

680
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,167
But that's as far as I'll go.

681
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:43,627
I…

682
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,774
Thank you.

683
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,285
Why are you making out
in front of my house?

684
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:18,787
Get a motel room!

685
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,134
How was it?

686
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:36,763
My reflexes, I mean.

687
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:49,693
By the way…

688
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:50,860
I…

689
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,863
I didn't get to finish
what I wanted to say.

690
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,076
I'm a Hanguk University graduate!

691
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,662
I can take care of myself, so don't worry.

692
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,667
Jeez.

693
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,085
"I'm a Hanguk University graduate!"

694
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,795
Who said I was worried?

695
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,090
Jeez.

696
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,730
Thank you for the ride.

697
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:30,483
If you won't apologize,
then don't do anything at all.

698
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:33,153
Don't write any more articles
and piss him off more.

699
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,487
Please,

700
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:36,865
just don't do anything.

701
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,034
If I hadn't exposed the school corruption,

702
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,369
I wouldn't have had to work part-time
to put myself through school.

703
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:43,246
I could've just gotten a scholarship.

704
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,583
I wouldn't have had to sacrifice
time and sleep to study,

705
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,085
and I could've helped my brother
with his studies.

706
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:51,296
And I might've even had time to date.

707
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,674
But I have no regrets.

708
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:57,469
If I could go back in time,
I'd do the same exact thing.

709
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,803
I'd gladly take that loss

710
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,306
on my own.

711
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,101
Good night.

712
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:26,915

714
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,389
WI JEONG-SIN

715
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:53,441
Jeez.

716
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:58,446
Why do our paths keep crossing?

717
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:00,323
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

718
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:02,492
I can't stop thinking about someone.

719
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,745
Is there any way to make that stop?

720
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:09,541
Whenever that person comes to mind,
replace them with a different thought.

721
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:13,503
You can choose a good memory
or a different person.

722
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:34,899
Onion!

723
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:45,243
It rained a lot today.

724
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,078
I hope you didn't get caught in it.

725
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,958
Somebody gave me a ride home,
so I didn't get wet.

726
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:54,085
Someone gave her a ride?

727
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,339
Who?

728
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,091
Did anything upsetting happen today?

729
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:03,136
Of course, it did.

730
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:06,764
There's this total jerk
who's been giving me a really hard time.

731
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,600
I'll have to give them a piece of my mind.

732
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:10,810
Please do.

733
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:12,312
LOL

734
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,439
I want to go somewhere
to take my mind off things,

735
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,732
but I have no time.

736
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:20,278
If you'd like, I can share
a simple feel-good method.

737
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:23,990
I read in a book

738
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,950
that giving compliments
for no reason can help.

739
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,745
And when you see
the other person look pleased,

740
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,330
it'll make you feel good too.

741
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,749
I haven't tried it myself, though.

742
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,503
Mr. Hwang.

743
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,340
It wasn't me.

744
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,761
Your outfit looks great today, Mr. Hwang.

745
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,765
Right?

746
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,476
I might not know much,
but I've got some fashion sense.

747
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,394
I'm good with colors.

748
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:56,314
Take a look at these shoes
and how they match my pants.

749
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,192
Not everyone can pull off this look.

750
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,194
It's a gift, I tell you.

751
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:02,445
Hey, Gil-su.

752
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,239
Stop the car for a moment.

753
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:05,907
Sure.

754
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,993
And this is one of my own
feel-good methods,

755
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:10,370
and it costs nothing.

756
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:45,863
Go outside on a sunny day
and simply stand there.

757
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,074
That's it?

758
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:50,827
After standing for a while,

759
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,080
your head will start to feel warm
from the sunshine.

760
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:57,417
When that happens,

761
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:00,503
it feels like someone
is gently stroking your head.

762
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:05,174
Nobody does that for you anymore
once you become an adult.

763
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:07,176
So I like to think that my parents

764
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,139
are the ones gently stroking my head.

765
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:15,226
It makes me feel better.

766
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:22,900
What's the matter with him?

767
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,447
Is he not feeling well?

768
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,449
He seems to be in some kind of pain.

769
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,792
Oh, by the way,

770
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:41,377
run and let yourself feel free.

771
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,546
It'll totally clear your mind.

772
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,550
Where's he going?

773
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:48,551
What the heck?

774
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:52,472
He's not okay.

I stood outside in the sun.

00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,190

dressing like a detective,

790
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,790
he actually looks amazing in uniform.

00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,000
Jeez.

792
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,794

you got me a cameo role as a cop!

793
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,963

797
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,014

-Oh, man.

803

Why hasn't anyone managed my fan page?

804
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:14,530
Because fan pages
are supposed to be managed by fans.

805
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:16,824
If agencies start getting involved,

806
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:19,285
it'll take away
the whole point of fan pages.

807
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,496

You're about to be fired
and summoned to court.

863
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,009
Principles, my ass.

864
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,970
Are you rich enough
that you don't need a job?

865
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:09,098
You said you have no parents,
that it's just you and your brother.

866
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,349
I get that.

867
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:12,393
I get it all too well.

868
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,145
I was in the same boat.

869
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:16,605
Pride doesn't put food on the table.

870
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,784
This is unexpected.
I thought you were determined to resign.

871
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:29,869
I know.

872
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:32,413
I'm surprised at myself too.

873
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,831
You made a good decision.

874
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:36,792

only ends up hurting you.

00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:46,969

879
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,055

889
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:35,142
Seriously, why did you suggest
that we recruit Mr. Yoon Jung-ho?

890
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,020
-You didn't even know him well.
-Right.

891
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:39,688
And he gets 90%?

892
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:42,233
Man, you were so stubborn about it
that I just gave in,

893
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,734
but we're not some charity!

894
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:45,319
Ninety to ten?

895
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,279
Hold on, bro. Tell me the truth.

896
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:48,572
Does he have something on you?

897
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,282
No.

898
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:51,617
Then why do I only get 10%?

899
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,037
I wonder if he gets any script offers.

900
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:56,664
Yes, of course.

901
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,166
His fees are pretty high
for someone his age.

902
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,835
He gets a lot of calls.

903
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,295
How long is his contract with us?

904
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:08,968
You insisted that we make it
an exclusive five-year contract.

905
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,220
Good job.

906
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,640
If any offers come in for Yoon Jung-ho,

907
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:15,558
turn them down.

908
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,269
Movies, dramas, commercials, events…

909
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,770
Don't take any offers at all.

910
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:23,357
Make sure he can't do a thing.

911
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,568
No managers, transportation, or stylists.

912
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,194
Don't provide any support.

913
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,239
Cut him off from everyone

914
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,325
-until he's forgotten.
-But why?

915
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,411
Have you heard of "private revenge"?

916
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,371
No. Why do you ask?

917
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,623
I can't apologize.

918
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,125
Not to that piece of trash.

919
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,042
That piece of trash…

920
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,379
He's sexually harassed women for years!

921
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,256
I'll hand in my resignation
before I apologize!

922
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,841
I'd gladly take that loss

923
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:51,844
on my own.

924
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,180
I want to try getting

925
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,182
some private revenge.

926
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:57,808
Why?

927
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:04,565
Hello, Chairman Lee!

928
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:07,234
President Lee, you're here too?

929
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:08,819
Goodness.

930
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:11,155
-It's been a while.
-Yes, sir.

931
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,158
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello, sir.

932
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:16,994
Nice to meet you.

933
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:19,413
Hello, sir.

934
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,414
I'm Lee Dae-ho.

935
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,999
Pleased to meet you, sir.

936
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,126
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun.

937
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,712
Mr. Lim, put that down.
Why are you carrying it?

938
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,839
-You left it behind…
-Put it down.

939
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:30,799
This is my younger brother.

940
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:32,426
You know Lee Jae-hyeong,
the baseball player?

941
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,886
-Of course, sir.
-Oh, yes.

942
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:35,804
We've met before, right?

943
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,097
Yes.

944
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:39,475
Nice to see you.

945
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:41,560
Nice to see you too.

946
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,642
SIMPLE AND EASY, TAILORED FIT!

947
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:12,651
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

948
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:15,738
Why is my fan page
so active all of a sudden?

949
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:16,655
"Soulishere"?

950
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:18,907
Thank you, Soulishere.

951
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,284
No way!

952
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,119
Melomaster, you should post something too.

953
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,162
Are you dating someone?

954
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:25,122
-I'm not dating anyone.
-You're so dating!

955
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:27,041
Something's different this time.

956
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,500
You like that guy, don't you?

957
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,045
I want to get to know you better.

958
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,340
I'll be waiting by the love locks
at the N Seoul Tower.

959
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,885
Do you believe in the Way?

960
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,678
Are you making fun of me?

961
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,225
